#[Dow futures fall more than 200 points as bank shares decline on recession fears](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; The stock market was set to end a winning week on a sour note as JPMorgan Chase led a decline in bank shares after it warned a recession was its base case for the year.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 200 points, or 0.6%, while S&amp;P 500 futures slid 0.7%. Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.8%.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan Chase posted revenue that beat expectations, but the bank warned it was setting aside more money to cover credit losses because a “mild recession” is its “central case.” The bank posted a $2.3 billion provision for credit losses in the quarter, a 49% increase from the third quarter. The stock fell more than 2%.
*****
&gt; Wells Fargo shares fell 2% after the bank reported its quarterly figures. Bank of America also fell 2% premarket despite reporting better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; Delta Air Lines also reported earnings and revenue that beat estimates for the final quarter of 2022. However, the stock slid more than 5% in the premarket.
*****
&gt; Investors have been awaiting these results to gain more insight into the health of the economy.
*****
&gt; “As the tug-of-war among analysts intensifies around the prospects for a recession — and the depth of a recession — the earnings reports from the banks, coupled with their guidance, should help clarify how businesses and consumers are managing,” said Quincy Krosby, LPL Financial’s chief global strategist.
*****
&gt; The moves followed a positive day for the three major indexes. The Nasdaq Composite snatched its fifth day of gains — a first since July. Stocks rose broadly as December’s CPI report showed prices declined 0.1% over November. While prices rose at a 6.5% pace compared to the previous year, the results heightened hopes that the Federal Reserve may soon slow its hiking.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 216.96 points, or 0.64%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 0.34% and 0.64%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Stocks are headed for a winning week, with the Nasdaq and S&amp;P on pace for their best weekly performance since November. The Nasdaq is up 4.09% through Thursday’s close. The S&amp;P has advanced 2.26%, while the Dow has added 1.66%.

21,StockMarket,"CLOVERDALE, CA / ACCESSWIRE / January 10, 2023 / Cann American Corp. (OTC PINK: CNNA ), the ""Company"", a holding company building a diverse portfolio of intellectual properties, is pleased to announce a shareholder update for 2023.

On October 31, 2022, the Company entered into an asset purchase and change of control with a gaming and technology company. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the parties agreed, mutually, to unwind that deal and return the parties to as they were prior to the agreement.

However, current management has decided to proceed with efforts to up list the Company to SEC reporting and continues to engage its audit firm in that process. The Company strongly believes this commitment to increased shareholder value should be honored and is actively doing so.

Secondly, the Company will continue to enact significant debt restructuring with its note holder for the sake of preserving its capital structure. The Company does not expect the current O/S to increase but believes there will be a significant decrease in shares outstanding soon.

Additionally, Cann American has engaged in a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), with a company in an approximate $12 billion-dollar biopharmaceutical sector. The proposed agreement would result in the target company becoming a wholly owned subsidiary requiring new Officers, Directors, and possibly Independent Directors as well.

The Company believes this acquisition is much better suited for Cann American than the previous gaming deal. Though this agreement is still outside of Cann American's current cannabis and hemp related assets, the acquisition would still compliment those assets by allowing Cann American to expand as a holding company focused on a wider range of therapeutic needs. The Company anticipates a quick transition with specifics about the target company to be released in the coming days.

Stated Cann American CEO, Jason Black: ""Sometimes what appears to be a setback is a blessing in disguise. Though, I was disappointed that the Mark2 deal wouldn't proceed after so much effort had gone into it, the current acquisition target is much more appealing from an industry and revenue standpoint that I believe shareholders will be much happier in the direction the Company is headed.""",Cann America Corp. provides updates on current deals and progress.,1673614391

40,StockMarket,"Data on Thursday showed that U.S. consumer price index inflation fell as expected in December, putting less onus on the Federal Reserve to keep hiking interest rates at a sharp clip.

The trend is likely to result in lesser pressure on risk-heavy Asian markets this year. Traders are now pricing in a nearly 95% chance `the Fed` will hike rates by a relatively smaller 25 basis points in February.

But while interest rates are expected to peak this year, markets are also wary of a potential recession, especially as the effects of tight monetary policy become more pronounced. Slowing growth in major economies could bode poorly for sentiment toward risk-driven markets.

41,StockMarket,"Apple is cutting Tim Cook’s compensation by over 40% to $49 million in 2023. This $49 million pay consists of $3 million base salary, $6 million bonus, and $40 million stock awards. Within that $40 million stock awards, $30 million will be dependent on AAPL share performance. If AAPL share hits performance thresholds, the $30 million will be doubled to at least $60 million. Therefore, in the best scenario, Cook could get over $79 million pay in 2023.

Despite the poor performance of AAPL, the compensation Cook received in 2022 was $99.4 million which includes $3 million base salary and over $83 million stock awards and bonus. The pay in 2022 was higher than the $98.7 million pay in 2021.

Comparing with other executives, Cook’s compensation is way higher. CFO Luca Maestri, General Counsel Kate Adams, retail chief Deidre O’Brien and COO Jeff Williams are all paid about $27 million total in 2022.

This is incredible, why Cook could get such a high pay even after AAPL sucked for the whole year, plunged 25% compare with one year before. Apple should have added that stock performance requirements on Cook’s stock awards earlier.

52,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**: Today's move higher saw our first pierce of the bear channel celing, courtesy of IWM.  With the upcoming long weekend, I expect volume will be light tomorrow which may cause price to drift higher, sending SPY above the bear channel as our second major index to do so.  That said, I am still in the bearish camp, as on the macro time frame everything we are seeing is occuring at the lower range of the down move we saw over the entire couse of 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**:  Price tagged the 200 DMA before pulling back.  Major resistance remains immediately overhead at 399.40 to 401.35.  Given the potential breakout of the bear channel in the IWM chart, I could see price floating through those levels tomorrow on light, pre-long weekend volume.  If price reverses, then 387.41 flag's top will offer some support, with major support at 382 ascending TL through the former bear flag.  Antoher major support level is at 374.77 flag's bottom (bolstered by 374.13 gap-fill just below). 

https://preview.redd.it/uxqapc34kqba1.jpg?width=2314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2c94d021ca3315c3734fed7e650d9aa6e5ebfc1b

**QQQ:** By comparison from a technical perspective, a 'quiet' day, but today's close did officially turn 274.78 into a support level -- and it is also being bolstered by an ascending TL.  The first major support is 259.08 flag's bottom &amp; previous pivot low, followed by an even more major level at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.  Nearest resistance remains the 282.33 gap-window, with major resistance at 286.51 gap-fill and 288.50 descending TL channel ceiling. 

https://preview.redd.it/znqp5b3fjqba1.jpg?width=2315&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=682633e350304a1289dfcba9ec159c6de52dc5b4

**IWM:** Yet again a leading indicator, price punched through &amp; closed above the bear channel.  Price must close above 185.95 before dipping back into the channel to officially turn the TL into a support level.  Given the coming holiday weekend, I would not be surprised to see price float into the 188 - 190 resistance level tomorrow. If price reverses, then 180.19 is nearest support, followed by 176.80.  The first major support level is that ascending TL cutting through the former bear flag.

**Avg Price**:  11.62  
**Exit Price**:  12.38  
**Short Size**:  2%  
**Thesis**: Price popped this morning right back into the same area it failed to move through on Monday (which I missed &amp; did not exit); therefore, I closed my position as price seemed to weaken.

**Exit Price**:  65.10  
**Short Size**:  1%  
**Thesis**: I entered this trade a while ago, yet failed to ever add to the position (hindsight is always 20/20).  I had just recently planned to transition this swing trade into an investment position, at which point I would've begun writing covered calls against it to chip away at my average price.  Put this morning's pop sent the trade in the money...I set a stop at 65.10 thinking it would give price the ability to consolidate for another leg higher...but I ultimately got stopped out.  Seeing how this had traded as low as $51 recently, I am more than happy to take even the smallest win here.

**Short Price**: 6.00  
**Short Size**: 1%  
**Thesis**: Big run up here as BTC broke $19,000.  I am using TA across both the RIOT and BTC charts for this trade, as both are hitting major resistance levels.  My target for this trade is $5 - $5.15, which corresponds to the previous pivot high as well as a 38.2% Fib retrace of this move.  I will add another tranche to this position at 7.28 next pivot high, which is also where the 200 DMA is coming down into.

**Short Price**: 13.53  
**Short Size**: 1%  
**Thesis**: 11-days into this vertical move.  I entered as price filled a gap from December 14th and hit the 200 DMA.  If price continues higher, I will add another tranche at 15.  My target for this trade is 12.11 - 12.22 which is the 20 DMA and 50% Fib retrace level, respectively.

**Symbol**: UAL  
**Short Price**: 50.00  
**Short Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**: Amazing vertical move across the entire industry it seems.  I entered this trade on the TL hit and 50.00 round number, and will add another 0.5% tranche at 52.50, then another full 1% position at 55.  My target for this trade is between $46 - $46, depending on how price moves lower after such over extension.

59,StockMarket,"‘Despite the tighter policy and slower growth over the past year, we have not seen clear progress on slowing inflation.’ \[1\] As J Powell addressed the Brookings Institute in November, it was clear that 2022 was a turbulent year for the Fed, emphasized by their inability to deal with rampant inflation; a result of the global energy crisis caused by the Ukrainian war, a global food supply crisis, and the rapid money supply increase since the COVID pandemic (in the last two years, the Fed allowed the M2 money supply to increase by approximately 40% \[2\]). On the global stage, economic growth slumped from 6% in 2021 to 3.2% in 2022 \[3\]; a result of monetary tightening across the board, the long tail of the COVID pandemic, and the cost of living crisis. The end of the year was topped off with the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX and a loss of investor confidence in the crypto markets. Private markets didn’t fare much better with deal activity and value on Carta dropping every quarter \[4\], exacerbated by the ballooning valuations in 2021.

# So what asset classes fared better than others in 2022?

https://preview.redd.it/8v1a3v548pba1.png?width=1842&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=56b56085b332a43f75770bfbc011eca5447f082d

It’s not surprising that commodities (DBC) generated **19.3%** in cumulative returns in 2022 given the macroeconomic factors at play. Managed futures also saw over **17.2%** cumulative return in 2022. On the other hand, the FED’s continual interest rates hikes hit long term treasury bonds hard. 20 plus year treasury bonds (TLT) and 7-10 year treasury bonds (IEF) both saw a drop **over 15%** in cumulative return. It wasn’t a good year for REITS either with VNQ dropping **over 25%** in cumulative return.

# How did asset class performance correlate with each other?

https://preview.redd.it/pzz5jkj78pba1.png?width=1401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4fd794dba4448404bd46e858abdba049cf605a4f

In 2022, stocks and bonds moved together (against historical wisdom), with a correlation of 0.32 between SPY and AGG, although the strength of the correlation weakened with longer term bonds 0.19 (IEF) and 0.08 (TLT). As interest rates rose and economic growth dampened in 2022, both stocks and bonds were pushed down.

Let’s now shift toward Composer-specific data. As a community, Composer users built **31,000 symphonies**, ran **1 million backtests**, and **automated 1.8 million trades**.

[Safety in Sin Stocks](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/6lLWbBtodpMpQjZlP1Od/details) (a symphony investing in the likes of defense and entertainment) showed weak correlation of 0.44 with [Hedgefundie’s Excellent Adventure Refined](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/GRJDa5zW93bZJwPDijdu/details) (a risk on/off symphony investing in leveraged equity/bond positions or safe havens) and 0.42 with [The Not Boring: Rising Rates with Vol Switch](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/GgJ8sChXZn6IXmiylDNw/details) (a risk on/off symphony navigating the rising rates environment). While Safety in Sin Stocks can potentially hold a combination of alternative ETF’s such as US Aerospace &amp; Defense (BATS), US Energy (ARCX), and Esports (XNAS), the Hedgefundie and Not Boring symphonies both switch across more traditional bond, gold, and US index fund ETFs.

Meanwhile, the[ Dragon Portfolio](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/vWMM10oxpSNOXY6vPuJ6/details) (based on the Artemis Dragon Portfolio) showed a very strong correlation of 0.95 with [The Dalio](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/6oGqcHPz8hb9s93lIeD2/details) (all-weather strategy developed by Ray Dalio) and [Golden Butterfly](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/7k87CXDkH0QCPHz5Infu/details) (inspired by the popular equal-weight portfolio combining stocks, short- and long-term Treasuries, and gold). All three of these portfolio’s hold long term treasury bonds, gold, and some form of commodity which can explain the correlation strength (although the Dragon Portfolio is more internationally focussed).

[Buy the Dips: Nasdaq 100](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/ltYJfAbjNyUjIrA2TQyS/details) clearly outperformed all other symphonies in 2022 with a cumulative return of **32.2%**. We believe the logic of this mean reversion symphony had good timing with dips in the market and was further emphasized by the number of opportunities that the symphony was able to enter TQQQ in 2022. [Crude Reality: The Smarter Oil Playbook](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/aw42jPNspqEl3RklAoPe/details) also showed strong performance with a cumulative return of **17.8%** (driven by a rally in the DBO oil fund ETF from February to June following the Russian invasion in Ukraine).

https://preview.redd.it/dp2dur5d8pba1.png?width=1766&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=56a1cb3fc637902ff0232a8358816c4a58ae4ec9

In 2022, SPY had a negative sharpe ratio of -0.74. On Composer’s platform, the [Volatility Hedge](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/0dKcj7cKmeHhafQKlrHM/details) symphony had the highest Sharpe ratio in 2022 at just over 1.2. Given the inflationary environment, [Stoic Finance Presents: Inflation Spiral Hedge](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/c1bWgoNRaiff8ZZwBGD0/details) also had a strong sharpe ratio. Note: We are assuming a 0% risk-free rate.

SQQQ and SOXS represent the most bought ETFs on Composer’s platform while XLRE and DPST represent the most sold ETFs. Overall, investors moved into leveraged shorts on the Nasdaq and semiconductor industry, as well as short term bonds. On the other hand, investors moved out of real estate, regional US banking stocks, and technology companies.

Evaluating [Value at Risk (VaR)](https://www.risk.net/definition/value-at-risk-var) at the 95% level, [Hedgefundie’s Excellent Adventure Refined ](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/GRJDa5zW93bZJwPDijdu/details)was the riskiest symphony. The risk on aspect of this symphony weighs 55% towards UPRO (3x leveraged daily exposure to large and mid sized US companies) and 45% towards TMF (3x leveraged daily exposure to an index of 20 year plus US treasury bonds). [Volatility Hedge](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/0dKcj7cKmeHhafQKlrHM/details) was the least risky symphony in 2022 focussing only on Gold and the US dollar.

# What were the symphonies with the lowest drawdown?

[Volatility Hedge](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/0dKcj7cKmeHhafQKlrHM/details) had the lowest maximum drawdown of 2.75% in 2022 as a result of holding safe haven assets (gold and US dollar). [Tactical Asset Allocator](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/kULEdknQwUoefsGpQKsT/details) was not far behind with a 5.59% maximum drawdown in 2022.

# Looking ahead to 2023

2022 was marked by rising inflation, an energy crisis, and a slowdown in economic growth. In this macroeconomic environment, commodities, safe haven assets, and long term bond shorts all showed strong performance. On the Composer platform, users were able to build smart logic driven strategies to capitalize on these asset classes. [Crude Reality: The Smarter Oil Playbook ](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/aw42jPNspqEl3RklAoPe/details)(utilizing commodity ETF logic) showed a cumulative return of 17.8%. Elsewhere, Composer users managed to minimize their risk systematically through the [Volatility Hedge](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/0dKcj7cKmeHhafQKlrHM/details) symphony, shifting assets to US dollar and gold. While SPY had a sharpe ratio of -0.74, Composer users in

[Stoic Finance Presents: Inflation Spiral Hedge](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/c1bWgoNRaiff8ZZwBGD0/details) and [Volatility Hedge](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/0dKcj7cKmeHhafQKlrHM/details) both had strong Sharpe ratio performance in comparison. Looking ahead in 2023, the Fed will hope they can push inflation back to their 2% target, most likely at the expense of a further slowdown in economic growth.

74,StockMarket,"Within just 3 months, Miami-based primary care centers operator Cano Health Inc. (NASDAQ: CANO) changed its appearance from an attractive M&amp;A target to a going concern story, takeover rumors were replaced by rumors of financial insolvency, and one of the largest stockholders sold out its position.

***M&amp;A Rumors Episode­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­***

On September 22, 2022, Cano stock surged 32% after the Wall Street Journal reported that CVS HealthCorp. (NYSE: CVS) and Humana Inc. (NASDAQ: HUM) were in talks to buy out Cano Health which focuses on senior primary healthcare and has 151 facilities across California, Florida, Texas, New Mexico, Nevada, and Puerto Rico. Cano’s stock price surged to $9.64 by early October following the reports that CVS was in exclusive talks to purchase the healthcare provider.

In mid-October, however, Dealreporter leaked that CVS walked away from a potential acquisition of the senior-care facility operator after which the Company’s shares plunged by over 40%.

There's been no solid news about the matter until January 10, when reports said that CVS is exploring an acquisition of Oak Street Health for more than $10 billion. Now Cano’s investors are left wondering if there was a Cano deal on the table at all and if the deal was indeed planned, whether it fell apart due to the high offer price, or because of the hidden issues that were revealed during the due diligence process.

***Going Concern Scene***

Cano dived deeper, erasing another 35% of the market cap after issuing a second consecutive guidance cut along with weak Q3 financial results on November 10, 2022. Although revenue and total membership were up 33% and 40% year-over-year respectively, the company reduced its expectations for the annual revenue, EBITDA, and medical centers numbers forecast.

Investors and analysts were concerned that the Company lost $112 million in the quarter and reported only $24 million in cash, compared to $163.2 million in Q3 2021. Multiple equity analysts cut their ratings and S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded its credit grade to B-, citing Cano’s weak credit measures that leave it with little room to outperform.

It remains unclear to Investors why the Company's management, the Board of Directors, and activist shareholders did not take all the necessary steps to ensure the financial stability of the Company.

***Stock Sell-Off Culmination***

On December 7, 2022, Bloomberg reported that Daniel Loeb’s Third Point LLC sold its entire stake in Cano amid mounting concerns about the healthcare provider’s liquidity and that some of Cano’s biggest creditors are in the early stage of organizing ahead of potential debt restructuring discussions. Earlier a NY-based asset management company had already disclosed a decreased stake of 3.5% in October, down from 6.4% in March.

Looking back at the events of 2022, Loeb was the first to push Cano for a sale process in March, followed in August by the letter from Owl Creek Asset Management to Cano Health Board of Directors, strongly encouraging them to seek a strategic buyer. Both investors believed that following the SPAC deal backed by billionaire Barry Sternlicht by which the company went public, Cano Health was underperforming compared to its market peers.

Now investors are left to guess whether Third Point’s exit is a sign of the absence of any prospects in the investment story or disagreement with the actions of the Company's management.

During all these events, Cano's shares managed to at first soar by 50% on M&amp;A rumors, to then fall over 85% on liquidity concerns. The most remarkable thing is that all this occurred within just 3 months during which both long and short investors experienced significant depreciations of their positions.

78,StockMarket,"Shares of Carvana (CVNA) was up 24.7% yesterday and continues to be up another 19% today, enough to pace the New York Stock Exchange’s gainers, even though the online used-car retailer hasn’t released any news. 

Trading volume swelled to 33.3 million shares, already well above the full-day average over the past 30 days of 20.5 million shares. The stock has now run up 48.1% since it closed at a record low of $3.72 on Dec. 27, but was still down 69.9% over the past three months even as S&amp;P 500 rallied 10.1%. 

The company hasn’t issued a press released or a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission yet this year. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On a positive note, Truist analyst Naved Khan sent a note to clients Wednesday saying data sources indicated wholesale used vehicle prices showed signs of normalization through the last couple months of the fourth quarter, and the average daily sales conversion rate improved in December from November. 

**What they're saying:** “We view the slower pace of wholesale price declines as an incremental positive for wholesale transaction volumes,” Khan wrote, including those operated by Carvana. Among others expected to benefit, shares of CarGurus Inc. rose 4.8% in afternoon trading and ACV Auctions Inc. climbed 5.1%. 

**Leading the bears:** Short interest, or bearish bets, in Carvana’s stock as a percent of float, or freely tradeable by the public, was 58.01% as of the latest exchange data, compared with 9.32% for CarGurus and 6.41% for ACV Auctions.

A straddle and a strangle are similar in that they are both options trading strategies that involve holding a long position (a ""call option"") and a short position (a ""put option"") on the same underlying asset. The important difference between the two is the strike prices of the options. 

&amp;#x200B;

Straddle:

In a straddle, the strike prices of the call and put options are the same. This means that if the underlying stock price moves significantly in either direction, the investor can make a profit by exercising one of the options (either the call or the put) and offsetting the loss on the other option. 

Strangle:

In a strangle, the strike prices of the call and put options are different. The call option has a higher strike price, and the put option has a lower strike price. This means that the strangle allows for a greater range of underlying stock prices at expiration in which the options will be in the money, and the investor can make a profit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Straddle vs. Strangle:

Both straddle and strangle strategies are considered to be high-risk, high-reward strategies, and they are not suitable for all investors. It's important to have a solid understanding of options trading and the underlying asset before engaging in these strategies and also to be aware of the risks and costs involved. Straddle is considered to be riskier than strangle because, with a straddle, the investor has to pay a higher premium than with strangle.

*****
&gt; Stock futures advanced Thursday as investors awaited a key inflation report to assess the outlook for the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking campaign.

&gt; Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 87 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.3%, while Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.2%.

&gt; All eyes are on December’s consumer price index reading with the consensus forecast calling for a slight easing in price pressures.
*****
&gt; Economists expect the consumer price index to dip 0.1% for December but rise 6.5% year-over-year, compared to a 0.1% monthly gain in November and an annual pace of 7.1%, according to Dow Jones. The CPI is well off the 9.1% peak rate in June.

&gt; “Inflation should continue to decline, leading to an end to Fed rate hikes this spring, keeping interest rates in check, and buoying corporate profits,” Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said in a note.
*****
&gt; Stocks rallied Wednesday ahead of the inflation report as investors bet that the Fed could slow down its rate hikes in light of tamer prices.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.8% Wednesday, notching a four-day streak.

All the workers at Singapore office are assigned as remote workers in Twitter’s internal system until further notice.

Before this, Elon Musk said that “no more work from home unless he personally approves” in the first email to Twitter staff since he takes control of Twitter.

One possible reason for the recent turnaround? The suddenly weaker dollar could be giving it a boost.

141,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**:  Another really good push higher across each index today, with QQQ finally joining the breakout party.  All eyes on the CPI data tomorrow, as it could take price up into (through?) the bear channel's ceiling, which could complete this current up-move and set us up for a pullback next week.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**: Another great move as SPY nears the gap-fill and channel ceiling, which should provide major resistance at 399.40 to 401.75 especially with the 200 DMA also in the mix now.  If price reverses on the CPI data tomorrow morning, then 387.41 flag's top and 381.35 ascending TL through the former bear flag are not officially support levels.  Major support will come form 374.77 flag's bottom (bolstered by 374.13 gap-fill just below).

https://preview.redd.it/53a85bcuoiba1.jpg?width=2313&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=659fe7d169e998434a9b4fc65dec1a6fb4768b65

**QQQ:** Finally joined its other indexes with an official breakout today -- and by comparison, tech still have so much more room to go before reaching its channel ceiling.  Nearest resistance is 282.33 gap-window, with major resistance at 286.51 gap-fill and 288.15descending TL channel ceiling. If price fails on the CPI data tomorrow morning, the 274.78 and 273 will offer some support, but the first major support is 259.08 flag's bottom &amp; previous pivot low, followed by an even more major level at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th. 

https://preview.redd.it/qvgkarimniba1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=93efdece24386508d1513911defa49c726af5964

**IWM:** Another solid move today, validating the breakout through the gap-window which now also turns 180.19 into a support level.  The channel ceiling at 183.50 is major support and a tag/pierce of this level would complete this cycle.  If price can get above the channel then 188 - 190 will provide resistance from the multiple pivot highs at the end of 2022.  If price reverses off the CPI data tomorrow morning, then 180.19 and 176.80 are officially support levels now, as is the ascending TL cutting through what was one a bear flag.  Major suspport would be a return to the 170.67 flag's bottom coupled by 169.11 the pre-COVID high.

**Thesis**: Price flushed down at the opening bell to gap-fill from 2022.

Taxes on futures come with more benefits than equity due to the section 1256 tax code. 

As a result of the IRS categorization of markets like futures under Section 1256, the calculation of capital gains and losses is based on a 60% long-term and 40% short-term ratio.

The same rules apply to futures options and index options. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wash Sales:

Futures trading is not subject to the wash sale rule.

The wash sale rule is a tax rule that prohibits individuals from claiming a loss on the sale of a security if they repurchase the same or substantially similar security within 30 days before or after the sale. 

&amp;#x200B;

Deductions:

If you take a loss trading futures, you can deduct up to $3,000 of capital losses per year from your taxable income.

Restrictions: 

ROTH IRA accounts are meant for retirement investments. Therefore, there are various restrictions for using margin and options since long-term investors generally do not trade options.

Stock brokers will not allow you to use “full margin” in your ROTH IRA. Instead, you can only use “limited margin.”

Limited margin allows you to sell cash-secured puts, covered calls, and buy options using your settled cash.

# [Stock futures rise after Nasdaq’s third straight winning day](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Wednesday as Wall Street looked to build on what has been a positive start to 2023 so far.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 94 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each gained 0.3%.
*****
&gt; The moves come after the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.01% on Tuesday to clinch its first three-day winning streak since November. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow rose 0.70% and 0.56%, respectively, and all three averages are positive for the young year.
*****
&gt; 2023 has brought a relief rally so far for more risky areas of the market, such as tech, but many investors are still cautious ahead of earnings season and further expected rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; “I think it is going to be a challenge to try to time when the Fed will ultimately start to cut rates,” said Matthew Palazzolo, senior investment strategist at Bernstein Private Wealth Management. “There is some evidence that when rates start to decline from the Federal Reserve, better markets are ahead. But whether that ends up being in 2024 or late 2023, at least at this point in time, sitting the middle of January, it’s just too difficult a situation.”
*****
&gt; Wednesday features a light schedule for economic data, but investors will be gearing up for a key inflation report on Thursday and major bank earnings on Friday.

* Although Cash App has become a more dominant part of SQ's story, the Seller and POS business (now dubbed 'Square') still accounts for 45% of the total company gross profit.

193,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**: SPY and IWM saw official breakouts of their flag patterns, which QQQ put in a potential breakout candle as well.  Probabilities therefore favor a move to the ceiling of the descending channel now, which would complete this 'cycle' of the move and set us up nicely for a pullback to test the October 2022 lows.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**: Despite price remaining within yesterday's candle, today's close officially validated the breakout from the bear flag -- giving the second half of the week a positive bias.  Price will see resistance at 394.30 gap-window, with major resistance at 399.40 gap fill (where the 200 DMA sits just below).  I would like to see a move to 402 descending TL channel ceiling to complete this cycle of the move before we head lower.  If price consolidates above what is now a support level -- 389.25 flag's top -- then we could see the gap-fill and channel ceiling converege around next week...which is all too conveinent given the economic data coming next week.  If price fails, then flag top is officiall a support level now, with more moderate support coming from 381 ascending TL within the bear flag.  Major support remains 374.77 flag's bottom (bolstered by 374.13 gap-fill just below).  Beneath the flag, there are major support levels at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note) and 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low.

**QQQ:**  Potential breakout through the ascending TL with today's close.  Price must close above 272.94 before closing back down beneath that TL.  There is immediate resistance directly above this level at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st, which will make the bull's job difficult.  If price can get through, 282.33 will offer some resistance, but major resistance will be 286.51 gap-fill and 289.50 descending TL channel ceiling.  If price fails, nearest support is 259.08 flag's bottom &amp; previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.

https://preview.redd.it/18gtcse74cba1.jpg?width=2317&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8bd039aa9b2fbefbb6aa393fe9bc8b60b4b3c28d

**IWM:** The break out of the bear flag is official, which makes 176.80 flag's top a support level now.  Price also closed above the 180.19 gap-fill, making this a pretty big day from a technical perspective.  Price must close above 180.62 before closing back inside the gap to make the gap itself a support level.  While this gives a positive bias heading into the second half of the week, there remains a lot of resistance overhead.  182 is 200 DMA, but more significant is 183.72 the channel's descending TL ceiling.  To me, this remains max upside before we head lower, but I would like to see the ceiling tagged just so we can close out this cycle of the move.  When price returns back into the the flag, the 173.71 ascending TL will offer moderate support; otherwise, 170.67 flag's bottom coupled by 169.11 the pre-COVID high is major support. And of course, 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows should also generate a sizable bounce.

**I executed 2x trades today: 1x long and 1x short:**

**Type**: Buy to Open  
**Symbol**: CVS  
**Entry Price**: 90.00  
**Entry Size**: 1%  
**Thesis**: Price fell to a major support TL datng back to late 2020, as well as the $90 whole number.  This trade triggered off a GTC+ limit order; had I been able to pay more attention during the intraday, I may have gotten a better entry as price pierced through that support TL to hit double bottom from mid-June 2022.  The fact price recovered so quickly today is reassuring, but I am ready to add another tranche at $86 double bottom from mid-October 2022.  My first target is 97.50 which is the 200 DMA as well as gap-fill, with a secondary target being around 104 a descending resistance TL if you connect the 4x pivot hights in 2022.

**Type**: Short to Enter  
**Symbol**: BSX  
**Entry Price**: 46.10  
**Entry Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**: I have been watching this trade for a week now, and entered on the 16th day of what is now a sizeable bear flag from early December 2022, as price may be slowly rolling over.  I would like to add another tranche to a 1% or 1.5% on a move up to 47.50 or 48.  My target is 41 (ascending TL connecting 4x pivot lows) to 41.50 (200 DMA).

232,StockMarket,"What is a stock split?  


A stock split is when corporate decides to increase the number of outstanding shares by issuing more shares to stockholders.

Even though more shares are given to shareholders, the total value remains the same since the share price will also drop. Like a pizza, there might be more slices but its the same pizza.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the point?  


A couple of reasons,  psychologically a lower-priced stock looks more affordable to retail investors.  Additionally, many retail investors may not be able to purchase fractional shares, so a $1,000 stock may not be accessible to all investors. However, if the company has a stock split and the share price drops to $200 per share, more retail investors can invest in the company.  

&amp;#x200B;

Traditional stock splits -  when a company increases the number of outstanding shares to decrease its share price.  

Reverse -  when a company reduces its number of outstanding shares. The best way to visualize this is if you took a pizza with 24 slices and combined them, so there are only 12 slices. The total size of the pizza remains the same, but each piece is worth more.  Generally only happens when the price goes so low that the company wants to artificially make it higher, not the best sign for a company.

237,StockMarket,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday stressed the need for the central bank to be free of political influence while it tackles persistently high inflation.

In a speech delivered to Sweden’s Riksbank, Powell noted that stabilizing prices requires making tough decisions that can be unpopular politically.

“Price stability is the bedrock of a healthy economy and provides the public with immeasurable benefits over time. But restoring price stability when inflation is high can require measures that are not popular in the short term as we raise interest rates to slow the economy,” the chair said in prepared remarks.

“The absence of direct political control over our decisions allows us to take these necessary measures without considering short-term political factors,” he added.

Powell’s remarks came at a forum to discuss central bank independence, and were to be followed by a question-and-answer session.

The speech did not contain any direct clues about where policy is ahead for a Fed that raised interest rates seven times in 2022, for a total of 4.25 percentage points, and has indicated that more increases likely are on the way this year.

While criticism of Fed actions by elected leaders is often done in quieter tones, the Powell Fed has faced vocal opposition from both sides of the political aisle.

Former President Donald Trump ripped the central bank when it was raising rates during his administration, while progressive leaders such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have criticized the current round of hikes. President Joe Biden has largely resisted commenting on Fed moves while noting that it is primarily the central bank’s responsibility to tackle inflation.

Powell has repeatedly stressed that political factors have not weighed on his actions.

In another part of Tuesday’s speech, he addressed calls from some lawmakers for the Fed to use its regulatory powers to address climate change. Powell noted that the Fed should “stick to our knitting and not wander off to pursue perceived social benefits that are not tightly linked to our statutory goals and authorities.”

While the Fed has asked big banks to examine their financial readiness in case of major climate-related events such as hurricanes and floods, Powell said that’s as far as it should go.

“Decisions about policies to directly address climate change should be made by the elected branches of government and thus reflect the public’s will as expressed through elections,” he said. “But without explicit congressional legislation, it would be inappropriate for us to use our monetary policy or supervisory tools to promote a greener economy or to achieve other climate-based goals. We are not, and will not be, a ‘climate policymaker.’”

The Fed this year will, however, launch a pilot program that calls for the nation’s six biggest banks to take part in a “scenario analysis” aimed at testing institutions’ stability in the event of major climate events.

The exercise will take place apart from the so-called stress tests that the Fed uses to test how banks would fare under hypothetical economic downturns. Participating institutions are Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.

243,StockMarket,"U.S. equities could face a sharper-than-expected selloff in 2023 from a recession shock that pushes stocks down another 22% from the current levels, according to Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson.

The chief equity strategist, who correctly predicted the 2022 stock-market selloff, which saw all three major indexes cement their worst annual losses since 2008, suggested on Monday that the S&amp;P 500 SPX, -0.08% could find a bottom around 3,000 points by the end of 2023. The index was trading around 3,919 at last check, according to FactSet.

Market consensus currently suggests the U.S. economy will experience a mild recession starting in the first half of 2023, followed by a recovery in the second half as the Federal Reserve is expected to stop its rate hikes and possibly cut rates in response to the worsening economic conditions.

However, Morgan Stanley’s strategists led by Wilson said that the Equity Risk Premium (ERP) for stocks, or excess returns investors could receive for holding stocks over risk-free assets, remains “way too low given the high earnings risk,” while corporate earnings forecasts for 2023 are “materially too high.”

“When a recession arrives, the ERP always rises significantly from whatever level you are starting at. In other words, if you think a mild recession is coming, you cannot assume the market has priced it given the ERP is at its lowest level since the run up to the Great Financial Crisis in 2008,” strategists said.

Morgan Stanley’s 2023 base case forecast for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) of $195, while their bear case forecast is $180. EPS refers to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding, and could indicate how much money a company makes for each share of stock. However, most of the bank’s clients are in the camp that the S&amp;P 500 EPS won’t be as bad as its equity strategists think, with the team pegging the average client estimating a ratio around $210 to $215. 

“Falling demand from higher interest rates and higher prices and payback from the pull-forward during COVID is happening just as supply is catching up to these formerly well-above trend levels of consumption,” Wilson said in the note. “That combination has already caught many companies off guard who are unable to reverse the rising costs fast enough. The result has been disappointing margins relative to expectations, and we don’t think that reset is near completion.”

That is why a 3,500-3,600 S&amp;P 500 range is not consistent with the consensus view for a mild recession, said Wilson and his team. “The consensus might be right directionally, but wrong in terms of magnitude… We think it’s in the magnitude of the move lower led by much weaker earnings and a Fed committed to fighting inflation, making 3,900 an easy sale.” 

Wilson, one of Wall Street’s most vocal bears, isn’t alone in his view that stock-market investors may see even worse declines this year on the back of earnings expectations that may be too optimistic.

Michael Kantrowitz at Piper Sandler &amp; Co. said in a CNBC interview last week that he expects the benchmark index to fall to about 3,225 by the end of this yea, or about a 16% slump from current levels.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently restructuring my portfolio and would appreciate any advice. Here is what I am thinking:

&amp;#x200B;

60% Value ETFs and 40% growth ETFs until inflation is at the target level (2%).

Once this has been achieved my plan was to restructure again, allocating more towards growth-based stocks, perhaps 75% growth and 25% value.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe this is suitable a strategy because 1) I am 24 and should take on risks while I can

&amp;#x200B;

2) Value stocks tend to outperform during bear markets and economic recessions, while growth stocks tend to excel during bull markets or periods of economic expansion.

Stock Trader’s Almanac figures show that since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 rose 39 of 47 years when the First Five Days ended up a gain. That is 83% chance of positive for the whole year.

Furthermore, if the Santa Rally, First Five Days, and January Barometer are all positive, then we have a historical 90.3% chance for a positive year. For now, we have 0.8% gain in SPX for Santa Rally and 1.4% gain in First Five Days, the only one left uncertain is January Barometer. 

This week might determine how January would be. We have Powell’s speech today and a CPI release on Thursday, both will determine market sentiment. 

I don’t think Powell is going to be more hawkish. CPI growth is slowing down, wage growth m/m is decreasing, the effects of rate hikes are showing up. Currently the CPI YoY is decreasing with a pace of 0.5% or 0.6% per month, and this might come back to 2% level 10 months later, which aligns with the Fed’s target, so it’s right time to slow down rate hikes. If that’s true, we might see stock market growing after this one-year long crash.

278,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**:  Bad day for the bulls, but another cool day from a technical perspective, as again we saw resistance &amp; support levels play out really well on the daily timeframe.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**: Potential break out of the bear flag remains in effect, as price closed above 387.41 flag's top.  Price must close above 389.25 to validate the move, before closing below that level.  Beautiful move right to 394.30 gap-window before pulling back.  This level will likely provide some resistance again, but 399.40 gap fill (where the 200 DMA sits just below) is the better resistance level now.  Max upside remains 402.40 within the current channel.  Flag's top is unlikely to provide much support, given today's close right on top of this level.  Therefore, 380 ascending TL within the bear flag must hold for the bulls followed by 374.77 flag's bottom (bolstered by 374.13 gap-fill just below) as major support.   
 Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low.

https://preview.redd.it/urdeghipa4ba1.jpg?width=2312&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=826bd602c8b49bbf6a63041176d846a49fd9fb36

**QQQ:** Perhaps a potential breakout of the flag pattern, but I will chalk it up as 10x days into this bear flag pattern due to how close the ascending resistance TL is to flag's top.  Compared to SPY and IWM, price remains more 'stuck' in bearish consolidation, and has yet to post the same clear-potential breakouts...despite posting the bigger gains both days.  Beautiful pierce of both that ascending TL, as well as the 274.78 pivot high from December 21st before pulling back beneath both resistance levels -- not a good sign for the bulls.  If price manages to get anove these levels then 282.33 is gap-window before 286.51 gap-fill offers major resistance.  And of course, the 290 descending channel TL is max upside.  Nearest support is 259.08 flag's bottom &amp; previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.

https://preview.redd.it/h9ba00po94ba1.jpg?width=2313&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6b679e0119dbdc4cdd0398a7f8d4b2a797c4d8cf

**IWM:** The potential break out of the bear flag remains in effect, despite the down day, as price remains above the 176.80 level.  Price must close above 178.04 to validate the move, before closing below 176.80 back under the flag's top.  Perfect tag of 180.19 gap-fill before price fell back down; I would say this is now moderate resistance now.  If price continues higher and can get through this level, then 183.95 descending channel TL is major resistance.  There is a chance 176.80 flag's top could offer support, but if price closes below this level then 173.71 ascending TL within the flag must hold for the bulls; otherwise, 170.67 flag's bottom coupled by 169.11 the pre-COVID high is major support.  And of course, 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows should also generate a sizable bounce.

**I executed 3x trades today: 1x partial close and 2x shorts/entries:**

**Type**: Sell to Close (Partial)  
**Symbol**: META  
**Return**: + 7.88%  
**Entry Date**: 5/09/2022  
**Avg Price**: 121.61  
**Exit Price**: 131.19  
**Position Size**: 0.75%  
**Remaining Size**: 4.25%  
**Thesis**: I closed the portion of this position which did not add up to enough shares for me to sell covered calls.  The remaining portion of this position I write weekly, ITM covered calls against...and I will continue to aggressively do so until the shares get called away.  I selected this price point because it came into gap-fill from late October 2022; I suspect this level will be major resistance and therefore I unloaded what I could without disrupting my covered calls.

&amp;#x200B;

**Type**: Short to Enter  
**Symbol**: FCX  
**Entry Price**: 43.62  
**Entry Size**: 0.75%  
**Thesis**:  Double top after a 3-day surge in price.  The potential cup-n-handle pattern this formed caused me to only commit a 0.75% position size at first.  I will add to this at 48.00 and again at 52.00 the next double top from April 2022.  My target is at least 38.00, with the potential to hit the 200 DMA depending on if/how this pullbacks.

https://preview.redd.it/hbxi15qjc4ba1.jpg?width=2315&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=797d66090d303d0d79ab6229648d843750d7d138

 

**Type**:  Short to Enter  
**Symbol**:  GLW  
**Entry Price**: 35.50  
**Entry Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**:  My actual target for this trade was 36.00 in the gap from late August 2022; however, as the broader market began to roll over I pulled the trigger here given the impressive 7-day up move.  But failure to get to my actual target led me to go with only a 0.5% position.  I will add another tranche to bring this to a 1% position at 37.75 -- and then add again on move up to 39.50 - 40.00 descending TL.  My target is at least 33.50 depending on if/how price pulls back, but ideally I would see the 32.50 gap-fill.

 An ascending triangle is a chart pattern that occurs when the price of a stock or other asset is consolidating in a tight range and is forming higher lows. This pattern is called an ""ascending"" triangle because it has a flat top and an upward-sloping bottom. 

The pattern is formed when the asset's price is rising and hits a resistance level, which is a level at which the price has difficulty breaking through. The price then bounces off this resistance level and forms a series of higher lows as it continues to test the resistance.

Without naming anything, I am currently invested in a small company that makes a product that I have enjoyed for years.

They still are not profitable, but they seem to be getting closer with every quarter, and they have plenty of cash with no significant debt. 

Here comes the strange thing. Several members on the board of directors/upper management recently filed to rescind a fairly large number of shares held as RSUs. The shares were marked as disposed of and were sold at $0. What does this mean? From my understanding, RSUs are a form of payment, so the members can only stand to gain profit by holding onto them and selling once vested, regardless of how the company performs.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-07/billionaire-jack-ma-gives-up-control-on-ant-group](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-07/billionaire-jack-ma-gives-up-control-on-ant-group)

It does look like Ant financials now have a clear IPO path in Jan 2025 on this news, and $BABA holds 26% of Ant financials stocks. So the Ant's IPO is huge for $BABA. 

Plus $BABA is so undervalued compared to its US peer:

$BABA Forward P/E: 11 [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/key-statistics?p=BABA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/key-statistics?p=BABA)

$AMZN forward P/E: 41 [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amzn/key-statistics?p=amzn](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amzn/key-statistics?p=amzn)

$BABA could gap up to $114\~$115 on Monday based on the Hong Kong price action. Then room to $121 this week. $126/share this week will need some of Powell and CPI's help

We have observed the performance of DXY for nearly a month, and DXY is continuing to form evidence of the secondary market in a long-term bearish manner.

Last week's rebound followed by a sharp pullback effectively tested the pressure range of the f-line

Under such circumstances, U.S. stocks will inevitably rebound sharply, especially for stocks with small market capitalization but special benefits

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/alywh26qsyaa1.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f841ebc2ea4673ae15c362d96d8fb6b5326c4bf4

After screening multiple stocks, $FLJ's current state is very suitable to grab the top spot in this big rally!

Studying the changes in the Chinese market and the divestiture of $FLJ's own bad business shows that $FLJ has enough energy to bottom out in terms of market, business model, and capital reserves

Moreover, the current price will immediately break through the long-term bottom, which is the best long-term buying opportunity

https://preview.redd.it/2mnyg8zqsyaa1.png?width=1528&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d049a4609a18be0a0708e967dc60cd9ee7717d9

&amp;#x200B;

From a long-term perspective, there is enough space above, we can hold for a long time and lock in profits at the position of the third pressure level

Due to the large fluctuation of $FLJ and the small market value, the current position can be controlled between 30-50%, and the position can be increased after breaking through the first bottom pressure price of $5

In the first pullback after breaking through $5, I will continue to increase position or add 3-5 times leverage trading.",U.S. stocks exploded $FLJ to the moon,1673246979

359,StockMarket,"I see these posts about how great the S&amp;P does, and we all know it does well over the long run.  Historically most all assets do well versus inflation over the long run.  But have you ever looked at asset returns when compared to the money supply?  Spoiler: it's pretty facsinating.

Here is the chart of the S&amp;P 500 divided by the M2 money supply: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/aEoSZiGX/?symbol=SPX%2FM2SL](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/aEoSZiGX/?symbol=SPX%2FM2SL)

Sure it goes up and down like literally any other asset chart, but the fact that it is flat since 1960 after hearing about how the S&amp;P 500 relentlessly marches up is pretty intriguing.  I guess the number of dollars in circulation also relentlessly marches upward...

What are your thoughts on this?  Is all of investing, specifically stocks, just a game of trying to keep up with the rate at which the Fed prints money?  

It sure does seem that way.  If your assets grow in value at the same rate at which the Fed prints new money, I guess you get rich over time even when counting for inflation.

360,StockMarket,Hi happy new year everyone. This year has started off pretty well for me as I 17M just started taking stock market and option trading very serious. I personally have been able to see the opportunities and possibilities of how much money we can seriously make within this type of market when u are on your keys and correct stuff. It also helps to have 3 friends which have made 50k to 100k in one month trading options helping you along the way and teaching you everything which I’m truly blessed for. One in which he is a 24M makes 200k a month off of it and just seriously shows me how there is honestly endless possibilities to this. No one our age is doing what we are doing beside these 1 or 2 kids here and there and they make only a few bucks here and there. For us a average or ok day is at least half a grand to a grand of profit. We are trying to focus on growing our portfolio and build large capital. It’s just amazing to me how is a group of me 17 year old and them 3 18M year old kids can come together and make in loads of money and we all just got back in within the past month due to a lot of things. Just 4 kids from Long Island soon projected to make well over 5 figures and soon down the road 6 Meanwhile that’s just really my main goal as they already do those things.  The market is truly the land of opportunities and I already do come from a family of great wealth as I live in the GOMD cost of Long Island but I truly believe I could seriously extend my families wealth to a whole new level if I really keep on with this and trade every week for years to come.

I’ve generally stuck to tickers like $SPXU when wanting to trade spy since the options are much cheaper (generally 10x cheaper), but I’m getting alittle tired of the large spreads and inherent loss of value as a leveraged pick. 

Do any other smaller account have insights on how they trade SPY? I’m looking to expand my options the next time I find an opportunity.

PS: I understand SPXU is a 3x inverse, but seeing as I’ve been bearish basically all year, and my positions are relatively small, it’s generally an “I’m either right or I let it die” mindset.

It can be seen that most of the shares also returned sharply after a drop of 20% or more from a peak. The S&amp;P 500 has risen an average of 15% the seven times stocks have fallen 20% or more from a record high.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**:  Potential break out of the bear flag; price came into that convergence area of 20/50/100 DMAs before pulling back.  Price must close above 389.25 to validate the move, before closing below 387.41 back under the flag's top.  Nearest resistance is 394.30 gap-window from December 15th, followed by major resistance at 399.40 gap fill (where the 200 DMA has now fallen just below).  Max upside remains 402.50 within the current channel.  Nearest support is now 380 ascending TL within the bear flag, followed by 374.77 flag's bottom (bolstered by 374.13 gap-fill just below).  Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low.

**QQQ:**  9x days into this bear flag pattern.  While tech saw the biggest percentage move, the fact is price remains within its bear flag and also under its ascending resistance TL; therefore, no break out (yet).  Nearest resistance is 272 ascending TL (where the 20 DMA has now reached), then there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st. Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is beginning to converge with the channel's descending upper TL. Nearest support is 259.08 flag's bottom &amp; previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.

**IWM:**  Potential break out of the bear flag; price perfectly hit the 178.03 gap-window before pulling back.  Price must close above 178.04 to validate the move, before closing below 176.80 back under the flag's top.  Nearest and major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th, with the 50/100 DMAs just under the level and the 200 DMA just above the level. Max upside remains around 184 the channel's upper TL. Nearest support is 173.25 the ascending TL within the bear flag.  Moderate support is 170.67 the flag's bottom coupled by 169.11 the pre-COVID high.  Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows.

**Entry Date**: 1/04/2023  
**Avg Price**:  42.39

**Position Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**:  I closed this position on 3x days of solid up move and as price went into a resistance zone created by multiple pivot lows from September thru December 2022.  Since the position size was not even a full 1% or more, I closed the entire position; had it been bigger, I would have closed 1/2 to see if the other half could run to those descending TLs above 50.

**Thesis**: I added to this position as price hit its next support level, a gap-fill from Fall 2020, which I identified in a previous post.  The next major support level is 91.63 -- I will add up to 2% to the overall position.  My target is around $136 the original breakdown TL, which is now also where the 20 DMA has come down into.

**Thesis**:  These trades are similar in that I believe money is rotating into them as relative ""safety plays"" given the volatility we're see across the markets and economy writ-large.  However, I believe even these ""safety plays"" will see trouble as the economy hits deeper recession, especially when the Fed does not lower rates (as the market has come to expect) in 2023.  When this realization finally hits, the money rotating into these names will rotate out and head for foreign investment (China, Brazil, etc).  The fact price in SPY, QQQ, and IWM are making a move to their upper descending TLs only bolsters my conviction, as hitting those levels to set up the next move down to break the Fall 2022 lows should provide an opportunity to cover these shorts.",Daily Review &amp; Trades: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,1673115123

I am quite unsure whether to carry on investing in the s&amp;p 500, it would be great if someone could give me further directions or reassure me.

Since 2020, I have invested more than 300 pounds in the s&amp;p 500 on the trading 212 platform, however in these three years, I haven't made much gains, and haven't seen the ""compound interest"" effect.

As of now I have invested in 6 shares (£370.15) in the vanguard s&amp;p 500 and have made a profit of £30.15, I think it used to be £40 but as you know the economy isn't doing so well.

I know this whole scenario is a bit dumb, but I am dumb haha. I just want to know if I should carry on investing because I am planning to put a big chunk into it. Or should I consider another ETF?

Younger folks- Now is a once in a decade time for you. Over your investing life you might see something like we saw in 2022 maybe five to eight times. Take advantage of it.

Four basic concepts you have to remember if you want to be successful in the long run in the stock market.

The turtle always wins over the hare -- slowly but surely. Don't buy junk -- Most unprofitable tech and all Crypto falls into this category. Except with your casino money.

Dollar cost average -- buy some every month regardless of what the market is doing. When the market was like 2022 and probably 2023 buy as much as you possibly can on a big down day.

Diversify -- good cheap, broad market ETFs from Vanguard or Fidelity are great.

Let physics or whatever heavenly name you want to call it be your friend -- ""COMPOUND INTEREST"" has no equal, except lack of time. A young person can get rich in 30-35 years if they follow these rules.

And, If you are younger, hope the market stays down for years. It is your time to accumulate and get that snowball rolling, so that when you are in your 50s you are making more in the market than from your salary. I started seeing that in my late 40s, but I have maxed out everything for going on 26 years. Learn about FI. And best of luck.",Hang in There!

470,StockMarket," I started trading in 2017, and after years of learning and trial and error I started to find success that came at a rapid pace. I started to see small consistent wins starting in late 2019 and like most, it continued through 2020 and 2021 growing the p/l month by month. I have always considered myself an extremely disciplined person and that helped me in anything I had ever decided to pursue whether that was something athletic or trading. 

When I first found success trading I found it through a systemic approach that allowed me to keep emotions out of my decisions and simply execute based on proven backtests and market data (see prior post). Throughout 2019-2021 I was extremely good at staying disciplined just executing my system and accepting the outcomes. 

About halfway through 2022 after an extremely successful first half of the year (surpassing all prior years' P/L combined with extremely large daily weekly and monthly p/l’s) I still thought that my system could be doing better and ended up uprooting the entire thing to chase bigger profits and something to bring back the excitement to trading.

This one decision cost me the entire year in 3 months and a complete mental breakdown of what I had been doing prior which worked. All because I got greedy and wanted more and had failed to accept what the market was providing me so I went looking for more and forcing trades. 

For example:

2021 provided 1,000+ R in P/L

Halfway through 2022, I was up just over 200R

That is why I wanted more and started chasing other trades but the market wasn’t providing that level of profitability at the time. Looking back I was lucky to be doing so well in the first place with how tough of a year it was in all financial markets. Some years you crush it, some years are slower, take what you’re given and execute it to the best of your abilities. 

We’ve all heard the term “you don’t have to trade every day” and it didn’t really hit home until having this experience. There is a fine line between making yourself better and adjusting your trading based on what the market is doing and adapting to it so you can succeed vs. fully disbanding what you have successfully been doing that is proven to work to chase more clout and money for your own ego. You have to walk that line very carefully. 

This was extremely humbling for me and brought me back to reality with a lifelong lesson. It just could have been a little cheaper LOL

Short selling a stock is a way for traders to bet that the price of a stock will go down. It involves borrowing shares of stock from someone else, selling those on the market, and then buying the shares back later to return them to the original owner. 

If the stock price has gone down between the time the trader borrowed the shares and the time the trader buys them back, the trader will make a profit. However, if the stock price has gone up, the trader will lose money.

Summary
Lumen likely alienated income investors as it eliminated its dividend, forcing dividend investors to exit rapidly.
Therefore, LUMN's capitulation to form its December lows has likely reflected this massive bailout.
The company is repositioning for growth amid worsening macro headwinds. Hence, the strategic capital allocation adjustment seems appropriate.
Investors with a high conviction of its growth pivot and tolerance for downside volatility could find these levels attractive.
I do much more than just articles at Ultimate Growth Investing: Members get access to model portfolios, regular updates, a chat room, and more. 

Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) has consolidated constructively after a disastrous FQ3 earnings release, where it ""eliminated its dividend"" and moved its capital allocation priorities into share buybacks.

The company's strategic change was necessary as it's repositioning for growth execution moving ahead. As such, the company needs to manage its resources appropriately, given intensifying macroeconomic headwinds that could crimp its ability to invest if it retained its dividend strategy.

With its $1.5B share buyback program, the company has the flexibility of deploying it within a two-year window. While we assessed that it's a credible move given the current interest rate regime to conserve cash flow, dividend investors who relied on LUMN for income investing likely bailed out in droves.

As such, we believe that the capitulation by income investors has likely been contemplated at LUMN's November/December lows.

Hence, the critical question facing investors now is whether management is competent enough to execute its growth priorities, even as recessionary headwinds are starting to hit enterprise/business customers.

As an integrated Telco company, Lumen has higher exposure to its business customers, as they accounted for more than 73% of its FQ3 revenue. Hence, we believe management is focused on improving its execution in this segment, as CEO Kate Johnson articulated:

And then now, for the first time ever, [we have] a leader running the team to serve SMB and mid-market. The mid-market motion is completely different than the enterprise motion. And so it got starved a little bit in the process. Now we see a huge opportunity there to invest and go after that segment with the right leadership, and it's going to 100% depend on our ability to build and nurture a partner ecosystem to help us cover those customers. (Citi's 2023 Communications, Media &amp; Entertainment Conference)

Hence, the critical question facing investors is whether they believe that Lumen is well-positioned to go after growth, even as its revenue growth has declined.

Wall Street analysts have likely penciled in their bear case estimates, expecting the company's adjusted EBITDA profitability to continue coming under considerable pressure.

Accordingly, Lumen is projected to post an adjusted EBITDA growth of -19% in FY22 to $6.85B. Hence, it's markedly below the company's midpoint guidance of $7B, maintained in its most recently reported quarter.

As such, we believe Lumen has been proffered a ""lower bar"" to cross in its upcoming Q4 card. Notwithstanding, Lumen still needs to prove its ability to generate growth given a forthcoming recession.

However, with the Street expecting a further 22% YoY fall in its adjusted EBITDA for FY23, management has the opportunity to defy the Street's outlook and lift buying sentiments.

LUMN last traded at an NTM EBITDA of 5.7x (10Y average: 5.6x), which surged from its lows of 2021 as its forward estimates were slashed. However, it still trades at a discount against its peers' median of 6.65x (according to S&amp;P Cap IQ data). Hence, LUMN is no longer expensive.

But is the valuation discount justified? We believe the company's move to prioritize growth in favor of its dividend strategy has likely introduced higher execution risks for investors to assess.

It's a factor that Johnson also highlighted:

So the first thing is [developing] customer obsession. I've talked a lot about that. That's building a muscle that will serve us well for growth. But investing for growth, these are parts of the company that have been starving for a long time. Sales and marketing, when you're operational efficiency focused, you tend not to spend nearly enough on sales and marketing. The next thing is building a reliable execution engine. And that's everything from product invention to launch all the way through the life cycle to selling and supporting customers. So you'll see us really fine-tuning our execution engine there. (Citi's conference)

Therefore, we believe Lumen's near- and medium-term challenges are far from over as the company works on its transformation and growth priorities. However, we assessed that the capitulation toward its December lows has likely baked in these headwinds, coupled with the likely departure of income investors. As such, it should augur well for LUMN's recovery from its well-oversold levels.

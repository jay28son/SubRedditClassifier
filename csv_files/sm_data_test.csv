Retailers own this, the majority shareholder they are (see...I can channel Yoda too). And if the philosophy of these meme-stock holders is primarily to fuck Wall Street and their hedge fund cohorts, the goal is to never sell. If that is the game, then no amount of shorting will cause the hedge funds to ever profit because they will have to cover every time, sooner or later. 

Shareholders never sell, but they buy a bankrupt company? The only image that comes to mind are angel investor billionaires who buy these equities because they want to donate the world wealth to the average Joe/Jane? This is the way a ""charitable"" billionaire combats the ""greedy"" billionaire?

I feel that if she can watch it in real-time, it will grab her attention better and encourage her to continue to save and invest. This is the most important part.  Nobody else in her household has any clue about stocks so the encouragement will be up to me and this custodial account.

I am trying to get others in her household interested as well, so I'm hoping her encouragement and interest will spread to the others. And I'm hoping she will be excited to see her account grow over time.

This hopefully will encourage her to sign up for finance type classes in high school when she gets there. And continue through her adulthood.

*****

# [Stock futures slide to start week with more earnings and a Powell speech ahead](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/05/stock-futures-slide-to-start-week-with-more-earnings-and-a-powell-speech-ahead.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Monday as investors awaited more earnings and an important speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial average futures lost 171 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.7%, while Nasdaq-100 futures slid 0.9%.
*****
&gt; Investors were also taking some profits after the stock market‚Äôs hot start to the year. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 7% for 2023. The Nasdaq Composite is up the last five weeks in a row.
*****
&gt; Karl Chalupa, CEO of Gamma Investment Consulting, said earnings could worsen further as the economy slows later this year and noted that no recovery from a major bear market low has occurred in the last 60 years when stocks were not at least fairly valued.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúOn average, new bull markets launched when stocks were 25% undervalued,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAt current valuation, the S&amp;P 500 would need to fall below 3,500 just to reach fair value; a decline to 25% undervaluation would see the S&amp;P 500 fall near to its Covid-low of 2,200.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Disney, Chipotle, Dupont and PepsiCo are among the major companies reporting earnings this week. About half way through earnings season, profits for S&amp;P 500 companies are on pace to be 2.7% lower for the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; Markets will likely be on edge ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell Tuesday before the Economic Club of Washington. Powell‚Äôs comments on disinflation caused investors to bid shares higher last week and overlook another rate hike out of the central bank. There is very little economic data due Monday.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWhile interest rates may be near their peak, it would take an actual sharp drop in rates combined with resurgent earnings growth for valuation to improve substantially without a further drop in stock prices,‚Äù Chalupa added.
*****
&gt; Investors seem to be looking past rate hikes and poor earnings and focusing on recent data that is showing inflation trending lower in the hopes that the economy is headed for a soft landing and profits will be revived later in the year. The S&amp;P 500 just formed a bullish ‚ÄúGolden Cross‚Äù pattern and touched a 5-month high last week above the 4,100 level. The Nasdaq‚Äôs five-week winning streak is its first since November 2021.

24,StockMarket,"Good morning and Happy Monday! I hope you all had an amazing weekend and are ready for the terrible month of February in the stock market! I‚Äôve brought this up time and time again to hedge your portfolios and sell out of general long equities you are green on or lack confidence in. Hopefully, you all have listened to the warnings we‚Äôve provided as the markets are starting to come down, and equities are not looking the strongest. 

I would remain relatively cautious at this point in the markets but still retain general holdings to capitalize on the momentum in the markets while assuring that the downside risk potential is limited during this time. Portfolios that are hedged accordingly, and people that are simply holding cash, will outperform during this multiple-week period of a downtrend. 

My recommendation for anyone who is attempting to trade today is to follow the general momentum of the markets and do not attempt to fight the conditions in any way, shape, or form.

27,StockMarket,"Overseas capital is pouring into Chinese assets with the strongest momentum since 2018 as the recent Chinese beyond expectation economic recovery gathers global attention.

In the first four weeks till Jan 25, overseas fund managers have poured $1.39 billion into China A-shares market, and $2.16 billion into Hong Kong stock market in the same period, according to EPFR Global. And by the end of January, overseas capital has added 141.2 billion yuan to their positions, a net inflow that set a new all-time record. 

Active fund managers' optimism in Chinese equities has risen to a five-year high...... In a very short period of time we expect to see more inflows from active funds,¬†said Steven Shen, a quantitative strategy manager at EPFR.

Separate data from Morgan Stanley also showed that, US fund managers focused on long-term investment have bought $1.3 billion US Chinese stocks, a second consecutive month of strong bullishness on Chinese assets. 

US long fund managers are starting to slow down the reduction of holding in Chinese assets, and having discussion with investors to unwind exposure limits to Chinese assets, according to Morgan Stanley, and the bank expects the capital flow into Chinese assets to accelerate in the second quarter.

As most developed economies are struggling to cope with recession, there is little doubt that Chinese stocks will shine this year, with numerous institutions raising their growth expectations for the country.

Goldman Sachs has raised its growth forecast for China to 5.5%, noting that the country's recovery is accelerating following the government's release of better-than-expected economic data.

Citigroup believe China's economy will recover more quickly and there is extra room to move up for the forecast of 5.3% growth this year. 

Morgan Stanley raised its forecast for China's GDP growth by 0.3% to 5.7%.

Meanwhile, analysts believe that as the economy recovers, Chinese corporate earnings are likely to grow along with it and add momentum to the stock market. Goldman Sachs strategists said on Sunday that there was room for further purchases in Chinese stocks. While hedge funds have increased their holdings in Chinese equities for 3 consecutive months, investors' positions have not yet fully kept pace with the current change in China's investment trends.

Investment banks also believe the underlying assets besides stocks including RMB, bonds, and commodities will continue to rise.

U.S. non-farm payrolls rose 517,000 in January, the largest increase since July 2022. The U.S. unemployment rate hit a 53-year low of 3.4% in January. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, January's job gains were broad-based, led by leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, and health care. Government employment also rose partly, reflecting the return of striking workers.

.

The probability of a quarter-point hike in March rose to 94.5% after the nonfarm release, from 82.7% before the data, according to CME FedWatch. Fed swaps reduced bets on a Fed rate cut in 2023, with the Fed's policy rate expected to peak at 5% in June. President Joe Biden says the jobs report shows the economic plan is working.

After a rare earnings miss for Apple, Cook and Maestri used some variation of the phrase ""challenging economy"" seven times on the earnings call. Both are unusual for the mighty Apple.

""The macroeconomic environment this past quarter markedly was more challenging than 12 months ago,"" Maestri told analysts.

Shares of Apple ‚Äî which fell substantially in pre-market trading on Friday ‚Äî nevertheless rallied on Friday. 

The economic challenges to which Cook referred could be seen in Apple's earnings.

After forming a low in Oct, $QQQ moved above the Nov high. This has been a change from what happened before, it didn‚Äôt establish a lower low. A full measured move of the Oct low to Nov high would project a price target to the Aug high, so $330.

$QQQ closed around the half way point of the third bar (red line). If it closes above that level, so $313, odds would favor the completion of the measured move to $330.

The Nov high, the bottom of the third bar, around $292.50 is a must hold support level .

54,StockMarket,"A California jury has ruled that Elon Musk is not liable for losses experienced by Tesla shareholders following his controversial ‚Äúfunding secured‚Äù tweet from 2018.

The unanimous verdict, announced Friday in US District Court, ends a three-week long trial over a class-action shareholder lawsuit regarding the tweet, in which the billionaire said that he was thinking about taking Tesla private for $420 a share and had ‚Äúfunding secured.‚Äù Those two words resulted in the CEO having to forfeit his position as Tesla‚Äôs executive chairman and pay millions of dollars in fines and legal fees.

Musk had spoken to executives of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund about the funding he would need to take Tesla private. However, it was anything but ‚Äúsecured.‚Äù

 The plaintiffs ‚Äî several Tesla shareholders who alleged that they lost significant portions of their investments in the wake of the share price volatility following the tweet ‚Äî were seeking monetary damages from Musk, Tesla and other Tesla directors in their lawsuit.

However, the jury ruled that plaintiffs failed to prove any of their four claims against Musk and the other defendants.

‚ÄúThank goodness, the wisdom of the people has prevailed!‚Äù Musk [tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1621653950947799042) after the verdict was announced. ‚ÄúI am deeply appreciative of the jury‚Äôs unanimous finding.‚Äù

Nicholas Porritt, a lawyer representing the Tesla shareholders, told CNN: ‚ÄúWe are disappointed with the verdict and examining next steps.‚Äù

Tesla [(TSLA)](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=TSLA&amp;source=story_quote_link) shares initially climbed 11% on the day of Musk‚Äôs original ‚Äúfunding secured‚Äù tweet, but they never reached that promised $420 level, reaching a high that day of $387.46. And they soon fell well below their pre-tweet price of $344, hitting $263.24 a month later, as it became clear that the funding was less than secure. That prompted the shareholder suit that is just now reaching trial after more than four years.

A turn from losses to profits about a year after the tweet started Tesla shares on an extraordinary run, gaining 1520% from the day of the tweet to its record high in November 2021. That record close of $409.97 works out to $6,150 a share, when adjusted for the two stock splits since that day. Even with the 70% decline in Tesla shares from that all-time high to Friday‚Äôs close, shares are still up 384% since the close on the day of the 2018 tweet.

**A. $META Meta 23Q1 earnings:**

1. Revenue topped expectations

2. lowering the costs

3. 40 billion dollars in stock repurchases

4. monthly active users 200K more than expected

5. Lots of stock price upgrades

**Summary: The market has predicted that Facebook‚Äôs revenue growth momentum will recover, so the stock price has exploded.** 

**B. $AAPL Apple 23Q1 EarningsÔºö**

1. EPS Miss by 5c   

2. Revenues  $$117.2B &lt; Expected $121B  

3. All-time revenue record of $20.8 billion in our Services business

Apple's EPS, revenue, and iPhone sales are all lower than expected, due to the supply chain problems in China. However, the market has already priced in these poor numbers. 

Apple said it expects iPhone sales to grow faster over the next quarters, and the supply chain issues will be easing. 

**Summary: Therefore, Apple's stock price pushed up after the earnings report.** 

**C. $AMZN Amazon earnings:**

[1](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&amp;src=cashtag_click). EPS Miss by 12c  =&gt;  slightly bad   

2. Revenues  $149.2B &gt; Expected. $145.2B =&gt; good  

3. [AWS](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AWS?src=hashtag_click) sales +20% YoY to $21.4B =&gt; good  

Guidance  revenues for 23Q1: $121\~$126 billion vs expected $125.11 billion 

**Summary: Amazon's revenue and cloud business revenue were higher than expected. Amazon's revenue guidance is usually a wide range, which brings a lot of uncertainties. But Amazon‚Äôs earnings report is not as bad as everyone imagined. As long as the economy does not experience a severe recession later this year, Amazon‚Äôs stock price might have a chance to rise sharply in the next earnings reports this year.**   


**D. $GOOGL Earnings:**

**1.**  EPS Miss by 10c   

2. Revenues  $$76.5B higher than Expected $176B

No updates on generative artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT-like products, and nothing too surprising. Shares rose slightly after the earnings report. 

**Conclusion:**

This year‚Äôs FANNG‚Äôs earnings are not as bad as everyone imagined. As inflation cools down, the Fed is about to slow down its pace of rate hikes. Therefore, since the beginning of this year, the rise of US stocks has been fast and furious. As long as the economy does not experience a severe recession in the second half of this year, the US stock market could continue to be quite bullish this year.","Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google Earnings Quick Summary and Analysis",1675653432

I've purchased 36 call option contracts on $TQQQ.

26 TQQQ 02/17/2023 33.00 C and 10 TQQQ 02/10/2023 32.00 C.

Here's why I believe the NASDAQ index will be higher in the next two weeks, compared to this past week.

Last week, here are the returns of the major indices and what they mean...

S&amp;P 500: +2.93%

\--&gt; General market trend is up.

Dow Jones: +0.58%

\--&gt; Rotating out of safe names.

NASDAQ: +5.45%

Russell 2000: 5.3%

\--&gt; Risky names are up.

Consumer Discretionary: +7.63%

\--&gt; Consumer confidence is up.

Oil and Gas: Down

Metals: Down

\--&gt; Inflation is down.

$AAPL strong uptrend --&gt; the ""King"" is strong.

$TSLA medium uptrend --&gt; the ""Prince"" is strong.

$GME medium uptrend --&gt; the ""Jester"" is strong.

\--&gt; The market in general is strong.

$QQQ strong uptrend --&gt; The NASDAQ is strong.

If the NASDAQ goes up, $TQQQ goes up 3x that.

If the NASDAQ goes down, $TQQQ goes down 3x that.

$TQQQ has a 56% chance to go up between 1-2% on 2023-02-06 according to Merlin.

I sell a fully complete **Excel financial model** for fundamental and technical analysis on company financials and stock price.

The model is divided into **three main sections**: Ratios and shareholders analysis, Income Statement analysis, Balance Sheet analysis.

The model works as a flow since the input required for the model to work are the data and numbers everyone can get from the annual reports of a company. Once you insert the data into the respective sections the numbers will add up in the summary sections to recreate the full Shareholders entity, the aggregate Income Statement and the aggregate Balance Sheet.

At the end of operations the data in the summary of all three sections will build the Ratios needed to perform **a fully accurate fundamental and technical analysis** on the stock and company you decided to pick.

Investment is a matter of risk management and ultimately we are responsible for our own investing strategy. Is this the tipping point of the turn around we are looking for?

I am not buying the posts about inflation rising, mostly because the dominator of the year-over-year calculation (January 2022) was high and will keep increasing until June.

10,StockMarket,"Hello there,

I sell a fully complete **Excel financial model** for fundamental and technical analysis on company financials and stock price.

The model is divided into **three main sections**: Ratios and shareholders analysis, Income Statement analysis, Balance Sheet analysis.

The model works as a flow since the input required for the model to work are the data and numbers everyone can get from the annual reports of a company. Once you insert the data into the respective sections the numbers will add up in the summary sections to recreate the full Shareholders entity, the aggregate Income Statement and the aggregate Balance Sheet.

At the end of operations the data in the summary of all three sections will build the Ratios needed to perform **a fully accurate fundamental and technical analysis** on the stock and company you decided to pick.

* ***The revisions also raise the probabilities for a wide range of policy outcomes, including an increase in the magnitude of hikes, an extension of hiking, and the possibility of the next move being up after a Fed pause.***
* ***The updated data shows that if the pace of job gains from January is sustained, a 50bp hike may be firmly on the table for debate.***
* The FOMC statement shifted the focus from the pace of increases to the extent of increases, and Chair Powell suggested that the March Summary of Economic Projections could include a lower path for rates.
* The incoming data releases, including jobs and inflation prints, will provide important information on the extent and pace of the Fed's tightening path.
* ***The February payroll report is expected to show net job gains of 200k, and a repeat of a 500k+ jobs print could lead to a 50bp hike as early as the March meeting.***
* The labor market may see more resilience, which could extend the tightening cycle.
* The underlying demand dynamics point to a slowdown in jobs, and the recent job gains are likely to be a one-off and not inflecting upwards.

47,StockMarket,"# A May pause comes into focus, but significant strengthening in the labor market could push rate cuts back to Q1 2024

**Data Preview**  
*Consumer sentiment is likely to reflect recession concerns, while the Manheim used vehicle value index should evidence near-term rising prices for used vehicles.*

**US Economic Outlook**  
With a shallow recession taking hold and inflation gradually easing, we expect the Fed to hike once more in March to 4.75-5.00% before cuts begin Q1 2024.

**Week in a Nutshell**

***Unexpected strength of labor markets may affect highly data-dependent Fed***  
The Fed delivered a widely expected 25bp rate hike and signaled another 25bp rate hike in March. Powell's press conference also stressed the data-dependency of monetary policy while discussing a wide range of topics. This reflects a dovish shift relative to prior messaging for a ‚Äúhigher for longer‚Äù Fed Funds rate. We believe the FOMC is laying the groundwork for a pause; however after unexpected strength in the January employment report, we believe economic conditions will remain too firm for the Fed to cut rates in 2023.We highlight our four key views in response to the meeting and January‚Äôs employment report:

1. A March rate hike seems almost certain.
2. Three more months of softening core inflation will likely motivate a pause in May.
3. Rate cuts are fully dependent upon incoming data and unexpected resilient of the economy will push the timing of rate cuts to 2024.
4. The Fed will not push back on easing financial conditions when they reflect softer inflation forecasts.

Overall, we believe the FOMC meeting adds support to our monetary policy outlook of another 25bp rate hike in March, to a terminal rate of 4.75-5.00%. However, after the upside surprise in the January employment report, we revised our economic outlook and now expect a shallower recession of just two negative real GDP growth in Q1 and Q2 this year versus our prior expectation of four quarters of negative real GDP growth spanning the entirety of 2023. Importantly, we now forecast the unemployment rate will not reach5% until Q1 2024, a level of unemployment at which we believe the Fed will start serious consideration of trade-offs between maximum employment and price stability and thus be open to rate cuts. In addition, the resilience of labor markets will likely slow disinflation of non-housing core service inflation, which is a key metric for assessing the risk of inflation rebounding for the Fed. Taking all into account, we now believe the Fed will hold at terminal until March 2024 (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ).

https://preview.redd.it/fgxfp383x8ga1.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fad47781de761fd122f73c401d1ebeecd8e50362

***January employment report shows a very different picture of labor markets***  
We believe the January employment report changed the landscape of labor markets, increasing the possibility of a soft-landing scenario where the economy avoids a severe contraction while inflation/wage growth continues to moderate. Nonfarm payrolls (NFP)jumped strongly by 517k, exceeding expectations (Nomura: 195k Consensus: 188k). Annual revisions also boosted the pace of monthly job gains from June through December, though April and May 2022 were revised lower. The revised monthly profile of NFP suggests labor markets were much stronger in late 2022 than previously reported. The strength in January employment was widespread across industries. This includes temporary help service employment, widely considered as a leading indicator for the broader trend of labor markets, which resumed increasing by 26k in January after having declined in November and December. Aggregate working hours, a gauge of general economic activity, also rebounded strongly after back-to-back monthly declines. Household employment, an alternative measure of job growth, continued to increase strongly by 894k, increasing even after excluding the impact of annual revisions. The unemployment rate unexpectedly inched down to 3.4% from 3.5%. Overall, details of the jobs report pose an upside risk to our economic outlook and reduce the likelihood of a severe recession. However, average hourly earnings (AHE) showed a trend-like increase of 0.3%, reducing y-o-y growth further to 4.4% from 4.8% in December. That suggested the recent decline in short-term inflation expectations is easing wage growth, despite strong labor markets. The combination of robust job growth and moderating wage growth remains consistent with our view that the Fed is still likely to pause rate hikes in May, while monetary easing in the second half is less likely due to the lesser extent of trade-offs between maximum employment and price stability.

***Upcoming data and events***  
The coming week is uncharacteristically quiet in terms of incoming data, but some interesting Fed speak is scheduled. Chair Powell is scheduled to speak at noon EST on 7February, while on 8 February NY Fed President Williams will speak at 9:15am, Governor Cook will take part in a moderated discussion at 9:30am, Atlanta Fed President Bostic will speak at a student event at 10am, Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari will speak at the Boston Economic Club at 12:30, and Governor Waller will discuss the economic outlook at1:45. At the most recent FOMC press conference, Powell highlighted data-dependency; key to monitor will be how he changed his monetary policy outlook after the January employment report. In addition, at his post-FOMC press conference, Chair Powell said the Committee intensively discussed the economic criterion for a pause on rate hikes. Thus, some FOMC participants could elaborate on that topic.

In terms of incoming data, we will have the January final Manheim used vehicle price index on Tuesday. We expect used vehicle prices to rise in the final reading as in the preliminary reading covering the first fifteen days of the month, though we would consider this to be a speed bump in the disinflation trend. Other than that, we will have the Q4senior loan officer opinion survey (SLOOS), which provides banks‚Äô lending standards for a wide variety of loans. In light of the recent easing of financial conditions in financial markets and the Q3 SLOOS, which suggested lending standards were tightening as Fed tightening proceeded, further information on how lending is evolving is of particular importance for the trajectory of spending and fixed investment. Consumer credit will also provide an interesting signal on the borrowing-related outlook for spending, and we expect a deceleration in line with rising savings. Last, the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan survey will be interesting to evaluate to see how multiple conflicting forces, including lower inflation, recession concerns, higher stock prices and higher gasoline prices, will collectively affect consumer sentiment. Also, it‚Äôs important to monitor the survey‚Äôs measure of short-term inflation expectations, as this may signal whether wage growth is likely to continue to decline in February (Fig. 5 ).

***This week‚Äôs data in review***  
In addition to the FOMC meeting and Friday payrolls data, this week provided some key insights on the labor market through JOLTS, the Employment Cost Index (ECI) and Conference Board‚Äôs consumer confidence, confirming that the labor market remained strong but wage inflation continued to moderate, while the ISM manufacturing index provided further evidence of contraction in the sector.

The ECI, the Fed‚Äôs preferred wage inflation measure, showed wage inflation cooling more than expected in Q4 2022, joining a variety of other wage inflation measures showing reducing wage inflation. Excluding benefits and government employment, the y-o-y change in the ECI‚Äôs private wages and salaries continued to decelerate to +5.1% in Q4 from +5.2% inQ3. Excluding also volatile inventive paid occupations, private wages and salaries moderated more noticeably by four-tenths to +5.2% y-o-y in Q4 from +5.6% in Q3. We highlight that the ECI wage inflation in service industries moderated more sharply than in the goods-producing industries. This downside surprise in the ECI and the concentration of this weakness in industries where prices are particularly sensitive to wages implies downward pressure on core services ex-shelter inflation. In terms of wage growth, ADP‚Äôsy-o-y wage growth measure, which also adjusts for the impact from compositional changes of the labor force, held level at 7.3% for job stayers. However, this follows three consecutive months of decreases for this large subset of the workforce, and we do not believe it reflects a notable shifting of the trend of wage disinflation.

JOLTS showed job openings increasing strongly to 11.01mn in December from 10.44mnin November, providing evidence of strength in the labor market over the month. The V-U ratio ‚Äì job openings per unemployed worker ‚Äì jumped to 1.92 in December from 1.74 in November, much higher than the pre-pandemic level of 1.2. However, job openings could be overly optimistic when signaling the strength of labor markets, as businesses might have continued to post openings despite putting a pause on hiring new employees. That being said, gross hiring and quits remained stable in recent months, suggesting that labor markets have not eased materially.

Consumer confidence weakened in January (-1.2 to 107.1), signaling recession concerns may be weighing on the consumer as personal spending falters and savings rates tick up, in line with our view that support from excess savings is waning. The report showed households remaining cautious about the near-term economic outlook, with the share of households expecting more jobs and better business conditions both deteriorating in January. However, the labor differential (the difference in the share of households reporting jobs are ‚Äúplentiful‚Äù minus ‚Äúhard to get) ticked up (+2.4 to 36.9), suggesting labor conditions remain strong even as activity slows.

ISM manufacturing surprised slightly to the downside in January falling 1.0pp to 47.4,showing contraction for a third consecutive month, in line with our view the manufacturing sector has been in a recession for some time. The employment sub-index ticked down (-0.8 to 50.6)towards entering contraction, providing some early evidence of cool labor markets, while new orders fell deeper into contraction territory (-2.7pp to 42.5), suggesting the outlook for the sector will remain soft for some time.

ISM services also surprised to the upside in January, rising 6.0pp to 55.2 (Nomura 49.5,Consensus 50.5), roughly in line with levels seen in November and October before the sharp fall into contraction territory in December. Large increases in new orders (+15.2ppto 60.4) and business activity (+6.9pp to also 60.4) show a sharp rebound in demand, while employment edged up 0.6pp to 50, in line with employment holding level in the sector. Supplier deliveries also edged up (+1.5pp) to 50, also signaling delivery timeliness was level from the prior month, sign of firming demand after flagging demand in December.

*Processing img bluu83iqw8ga1...*

*Consumer sentiment is likely to reflect recession concerns, while the Manheim used vehicle value index should evidence near-term rising prices for used vehicles.*

***Trade balance (Tuesday):*** We forecast the December trade deficit to come in at$67.8bn, based on the advance nominal goods figures and our expectations for net trade-in services. This represents some bounce-back following the surprisingly low November trade deficit of $61.5bn. That said, the underlying trend has been a reducing trade deficit as softening domestic demand weakens imports relatively more than exports. However, exports are likely to remain relatively resilient given China‚Äôs reopening and an improving economic outlook for Europe, and we expect this dynamic to continue.

***Manheim used vehicle value index (Tuesday):*** The preliminary January Manheim wholesale used vehicle prices rose 1.5% m-o-m based on the first 15 days of the month. We expect the full-month final reading to remain positive m-o-m. However, we expect this increase to be a speed bump in the medium-term disinflation trend. Lending standards for auto loans continued to tighten and interest rates for car loans remained high, which should weigh on demand for vehicles. Moreover, dealers‚Äô margins (as determined by price differences between wholesale and retail sales) will likely be squeezed, keeping CPI‚Äôs used vehicle prices declining, even if wholesale prices rebound temporarily.

***Consumer credit (Tuesday):*** Data from the Fed on weekly bank lending suggest December consumer credit decelerated from November‚Äôs consumer credit growth of$28.0bn. That said, we would note this signal should be interpreted with caution, as Fed data suggested credit growth was well below actual consumer credit growth in November. This signal suggests a risk that slowing December credit per Fed bank lending data may once again undershoot actual consumer credit growth. However, with the personal savings rate having risen 0.5pp in December, and evidence many consumers are approaching credit constraints while lending standards tighten, we think a deceleration in December consumer credit is likely.

***Jobless claims (Thursday):*** Jobless claims remained persistent over January, however we expect slowing economic activity will soon begin to soften claims. It is possible the backlog of open positions, as evidenced by the V-U ratio rising to 1.92 in December, is keeping claims low as many workers affected by widely covered headcount reductions are reportedly finding new employment before registering for unemployment benefits. However, as the labor market continues to cool, this effect that could be reducing claims should dissipate, and claims are likely to begin to better reflect slowing economic conditions.

***University of Michigan consumer sentiment (Friday):*** We expect the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index to remain relatively unchanged in February following January‚Äôs upside surprise. Recession concerns appear to be weighing on consumers as excess savings become depleted, as evidenced by the conference board‚Äôs weak January consumer confidence index and the uptick in personal savings. This is likely to weigh on sentiment through the interview period, which commences only one day after the end of the January consumer confidence survey period. By contrast, resilient labor markets and higher stock prices could offset the negative impact from recession concerns. Continued media coverage of easing inflation could add some downward pressure to inflation expectations, which remains one of our focal points to monitor for any unexpected resurgence after the recent downward trend.

***US budget (Friday):*** Data from the Daily Treasury statement suggest a budget deficit of around $42bn in January, weakening from a surplus of $119bn in January 2022.

# US Economic Outlook

*With a shallow recession taking hold and inflation gradually easing, we expect the Fed to hike once more in March to 4.75-5.00% before cuts begin March 2024*

***Economic activity:*** Growth momentum is easing despite strength in the labor market, and we expect a recession started in December 2022. Easing financial conditions and a strong labor market are likely to add support to flagging economic activity. As the housing market recession deepens , and an early industrial sector downturn emerges , retail sales and industrial production are flagging , and real income and spending are likely to follow, despite support from labor markets. The pace of contraction may be cushioned by strong balance sheets we expect a shallow recession, followed by a gradual recovery due to alack of both monetary and fiscal policy support. High uncertainty and interest rates will likely continue to weigh on both residential and nonresidential fixed investment. Despite labor market strength , we expect job losses to start in Q2 2023, with an end-2024unemployment rate around 5.3%.

***Inflation:*** Recent data suggest inflationary pressures are gradually faltering . The speed of core goods price declines accelerated and key non-rent core service inflation continued to slow. In addition, rent-related components will likely start to moderate in early 2023based on leading private rent data. Moreover, the expected downturn is beginning to weigh on non-housing core service inflation which is strongly linked to labor markets. Core PCE inflation, the Fed‚Äôs preferred metric, will likely decelerate toward the Fed‚Äôs 2%target on a y-o-y basis by end-2024

***Policy:*** As still-elevated monthly inflation moderates gradually, and after 450bp of tightening, Fed participants are likely to hike once more in March to a 4.75-5.00%terminal rate. A pause is likely until the unemployment rate increases to a point where the Fed reconsiders the tradeoff between inflation risks and job growth, and normalizing core services ex-shelter inflation suggests the risk of inflation rebounding decreases. At that point, we believe the Fed will cut rates by 25bp/meeting, starting in March 2024. We expect the Fed to end balance sheet runoff after March 2024 to avoid working at cross purposes with rate cuts.

***Risks:*** We see risks as balanced. Inflation could slow earlier than expected, but upside risks include more persistent than expected core-services ex-shelter inflation and renewed supply chain disruptions. Fed tightening could weigh on growth more heavily than we assume, but the labor market remaining resilient despite wage inflation moderating poses upside risk;.

Here's this week's news for Palantir, let's go through it together [(full article here)](https://news.thecompounder.co/palantir-news-feb-05-2023)

&amp;#x200B;

**1. UK CONFIDENCE**

The UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, is praising Palantir.

They stated that Foundry is doing ""a really good job"" in reducing the elective care backlog. At a couple locations, Palantir software led to an almost 1/3 reduction in backlogs - that's significant.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. MARKETPLACE ECOSYSTEM**

Palantir has announced a Foundry Marketplace - this is huge. This platform will allow developers to create workflows that are built in Foundry and easily distribute it with a consumer facing storefront.

This is an example of Network Effects - and could result in Foundry becoming a much sticker platform.

The focus on partners has been a priority to Palantir as they built out the commercial business and there are many examples of other software companies that have leveraged a marketplace ecosystem to thrive.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. $50M DEAL**

Palantir has announced a $50 Million expansion with SOMPO Holdings.

The reason for the expansion was to allow a deployment to over 10,000 employees at SOMPO Japan.

Since this is an expansion, we have some insight on the existing deployment and deal - and the feedback has been extremely positive, with Foundry being the ""backbone"" for the company as they embrace digital transformation.

&amp;#x200B;

**4. HOW UKRAINE USES PALANTIR**

Palantir CEO has made a statement saying that they ""responsible for most of the targeting in Ukraine"".

What does this mean?

As Ukraine continues to defend its land, they are using Palantir to target tanks and artillery. This helps Ukraine leverage technology to optimize their military.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. ANALYST CHANGES**

Not much activity this week with Analysts - just one (Citigroup) that set a SELL rating and $5 price target. As always, take analyst ratings with a grain of salt.

78,StockMarket," Fidelity National Information Services Inc., which is undergoing a corporate review including cost cutting under new CEO Stephanie Ferris, has eliminated 2,600 jobs in recent weeks, according to a Feb. 2 Bloomberg News report.

The cuts included about 1,000 contractors for the Jacksonville-based company known as FIS, according to the report.

A spokesman for FIS said the company could not comment on the report.

FIS has not filed any notices of layoffs in Florida under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.

The company had more than 65,000 employees in 120 global locations, with more than 40,000 outside the U.S., according to its 2021 annual report.

FIS opened a new 12-story headquarters building in October at 347 Riverside Ave.

The company promised to add 500 jobs to the 1,216 workers it had in Jacksonville when it started the headquarters project. At an Oct. 12 ribbon-cutting, CEO Gary Norcross said it was 75% of the way toward hiring those new workers.

Six days later, FIS announced that Ferris would be promoted from president to the additional role of chief executive with Norcross becoming executive chairman.

Since that announcement, FIS has come under pressure from activist shareholders, including two hedge fund companies, to improve operations after disappointing results in its merchant payment services business.

When FIS announced its third-quarter results in November, Ferris announced an ‚Äúenterprise transformation program‚Äù for the company that would include $500 million in annual expense cuts.

Ferris was supposed to assume the CEO role Jan. 1 but FIS accelerated the changes and installed her in the top spot Dec. 15, with Norcross leaving the company entirely.

That same day, FIS appointed a new board member under a cooperation agreement with hedge fund firm D.E. Shaw.

FIS, which had focused on banking technology services, acquired the merchant payment technology business when it bought Worldpay Inc. in 2019.

Analysts have said the Worldpay operations have produced disappointing results for FIS since the acquisition.

Ferris was chief financial officer of Worldpay when FIS bought the company.

According to Bloomberg, FIS‚Äô stock has fallen 36% in the past year, while the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index is down by 16%.","FIS cut 2,600 jobs, including 1,000 contractors",1675497831

84,StockMarket," EVERTEC, Inc. ([NYSE:EVTC](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/software/nyse-evtc/evertec)), is not the largest company out there, but it led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock‚Äôs share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let‚Äôs examine EVERTEC‚Äôs valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there‚Äôs still a bargain opportunity. 

 Good news, investors! EVERTEC is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I‚Äôve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock‚Äôs cash flows. I find that EVERTEC‚Äôs ratio of 9.9x is below its peer average of 28.56x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the IT industry. EVERTEC‚Äôs share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its industry peers, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it‚Äôs there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range. 

 Future outlook is an important aspect when you‚Äôre looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let‚Äôs also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with an extremely negative double-digit change in profit expected over the next couple of years, near-term growth is certainly not a driver of a buy decision. It seems like high uncertainty is on the cards for EVERTEC, at least in the near future.

99,StockMarket,"Here are some of my observations and thoughts on the market and the economy

(Note, all the discussions below are held with the assumption that a black swan event won‚Äôt happen)

1. I‚Äôm not very bullish on stock price now
Simply because the market prices in too much growth and disinflation that‚Äôs unrealistically rapid.

With service/wage inflation staying (but only slightly to the upside) and commodity prices fluctuates (and go up in Jan-Feb), we will see Fed raising rates and keeping them there. That would break the market‚Äôs perception of an early cut. I believe the indicators all scream that the market is overextended right now and will do a healthy pullback once February CPI hits the market.

So likely SPX bounces between 340 - 420 before something goes horribly wrong or Fed shows willingness to cut (usually the former leads to the latter).

2. The US economy is very resilient, mostly because of residual cash stack, government spending and the gig economy. 

Fed data shows that there are still 2 trillions of cash being piped in and out of reverse repo every day. 

And even if someone lost his or her job, one can easily generate a livable income with Uber, Doordash, Instacart. So the surprises we see in the jobs report are somewhat justified (some even argue the underground weed economy is one of the factors that saved the US from total obliteration in 08). (Think of this way: each job, either side gig or full time job, is a connection between a demand and a supply, which weaves the economy together. Now such connections are very easy to establish - meaning the economy‚Äôs ability to heal itself has improved dramatically with the gig economy).

Plus, let‚Äôs not forget the Biden administration just spent like crazy in the last 2 years - boosting construction and manufacturing by a huge amount! And these are long term jobs - think of roads, factories, infrastructures, and will be keep a good amount of people employed.

So I don‚Äôt see a deep recession the like of 08 coming very soon.

That number of contracts represents approximately 2.9 million underlying shares, working out to a sizeable 67.6% of DISH's average daily trading volume over the past month, of 4.3 million shares. Particularly high volume was seen for the $13.50 strike put option expiring January 27, 2023. (source: [NASDAQ](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/noteworthy-thursday-option-activity:-has-mmm-dish))

Couple of big investors have been adjusting their positions in the stock, with Covestor Ltd. increasing their shares by 268.9% and Ellevest Inc. upping their stake by 63%. Other players like Wipfli Financial Advisors LLC and Trust Company of Vermont invested in DISH, and Whittier Trust Company's ownership increased by 58.7%. It's worth noting that 96.51% of DISH's shares are held by institutional investors.

Analysts have been weighing in too, with Barclays downgrading the stock to ""underweight"" and lowering their price target to $16.00. Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group also lowered their price targets, and Raymond James changed their ""strong-buy"" rating to a ""buy."" The overall rating is ""Moderate Buy"" with a price objective of $35.21.

DISH's stock price has ranged from $12.55 to $37.28 in the past 52 weeks, with a P/E ratio of 4.97 and a beta of 1.81.

DISH Network last released its quarterly earnings results on November 2nd, 2022. DISH reported Q2 earnings of $0.65 per share, which was higher than expected, but revenue was lower than anticipated. The company had a net margin of 11.24 and a return on equity of 11.81%, both of which are pretty solid. Analysts predict DISH will earn $2.63 per share this fiscal year.

With the recent SPX / SPY / QQQ rallying, maybe it's time to consider a company at the crossroads of tech, infrastructure, media and entertainment. But the markets' response to the latest jobs report and sluggish Big Tech earnings yesterday might call for some risk management.

1. Inflation is going to crash in the next 3 months. Housing is the biggest component of inflation, and it has stalled and come down in most places. Remember, inflation is the CHANGE in prices year-or-year. Inflation does not measure how affordable homes are or how affordable cars, food, services, etc. are. 
2. the job market is still tight. Inflation is coming down and interest rates have move up the fastest ever. The job market is staying afloat. Pretty cut and dry, people are still brining home a paycheck. Companies are still hiring, still expanding. 
3. There is no recession and probably wont be a recession. I mean, the ability of people to predict a recession is very bad. Which means, the recession people predicted that will occur this year? Yeah that probably wont happen. 
4. Obviously the biggest one. The Fed will only raise rates a few more times. Probably only two more times. Brining us to a fed funds rate of about 5%. Thats still low.
5. All the bad things are priced in and there hasnt been any other shock. Ukraine war, elections, oil prices. All behind us. There is no more uncertainty left to deal with. The stock market always rally's after a midterm. This midterm solidified gridlock for the next two years. Therefore, minimizing uncertainty. 

I think youre next opportunity is to buy as momentum slows. The market and every other growth stock is very overbought. RSI, Money flow, Accumulation index. All very overbought. When the momentum indicators come down, thats your opportunity. But dont forget, just because the indicators come down doesnt mean the market comes down.

144,StockMarket,"Shares of Nordstrom surged Friday morning following news that activist investor and meme stock maven Ryan Cohen bought a stake in the high-end department store company.

The stock was up about 30% in premarket trading.

The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported Thursday evening that Cohen was in the process of acquiring a ‚Äúsizable stake‚Äù in Nordstrom while looking to shake up its board. The Journal said Cohen is now one of Nordstrom‚Äôs top five nonfamily shareholders.

Nordstrom, for its part, said it was open to hearing Cohen out.

‚ÄúWhile Mr. Cohen hasn‚Äôt sought any discussions with us in several years, we are open to hearing his views, as we do with all Nordstrom shareholders,‚Äù the company said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe will continue to take actions that we believe are in the best interests of the company and our shareholders.‚Äù

The news about Cohen comes weeks after Nordstrom, which has had to dramatically mark down prices to ease an inventory glut, reported lackluster holiday sales and slashed its guidance for the year. The company is set to report earnings March 2.

Cohen, who founded pet retail and health site Chewy, is considered a champion of the meme stock crowd. He is the chairman of Reddit favorite GameStop. He also triggered a brief rally in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond last year before he ultimately dumped out of the stock. Bed Bath is expected to file for bankruptcy protection any day now.

Cohen appears to be taking aim once again at Mark Tritton, the former Target executive who was forced out as Bed Bath CEO last year as Cohen‚Äôs firm pressured the struggling home goods retailer. Tritton has been on Nordstrom‚Äôs board for nearly three years, after having previously worked for the company from 2009 to 2016.

According to the Journal, Cohen thinks Tritton, because of his prior experience working at the company shouldn‚Äôt be deciding on compensation for Nordstrom family members who are also executives at the retailer. Erik Nordstrom is the company‚Äôs CEO, while Peter Nordstrom serves as its president.

The ECB raised all three of its main interest rates by 50 basis points, with the main refinancing rate at its highest level since November 2008. Given underlying inflationary pressures, interest rates still need to rise steadily and sharply, with a further 50 basis point increase planned for March. The asset purchase program will be reduced by ‚Ç¨15bn per month between March and the end of June, and will vary over time after the second quarter. Will keep interest rates at a level restrictive enough to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in time. According to sources: ECB policymakers are expected to raise interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points in May, with at least two more hikes expected.

168,StockMarket," For the third day in a row, **Tesla** stock is riding higher -- up 4.3% as of 10:10 a.m. ET. The Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates only 25 basis points yesterday is probably part of the reason for that -- indeed, growth stocks in general seem happy to run today, with the entire Nasdaq up nearly 2%. 

 And even more specifically, Tesla's electric car Gigafactory in¬†Shanghai.

Tesla's plan to cut the prices of its electric cars, you see -- not just in the U.S., but [in China as well](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/01/06/why-tesla-stock-dropped-again/) \-- is having its intended effect of stoking consumer demand. As Reuters reported yesterday, Tesla is ramping up production of its popular Model 3 and Model Y EVs in Shanghai. Over the next two months, Tesla expects to grow Shanghai output to nearly 20,000 vehicles -- putting the factory on course to produce more than 1 million vehicles this year. ¬†

 Thus, it seems that Shanghai -- both Tesla's most prodigious producer of EVs, and its most profitable -- could all on its own account for half of Elon Musk's goal of delivering 2 million cars to consumers this year.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 223.08%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this payment processing software company would post earnings of $0.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.14, delivering a surprise of 133.33%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bill.com , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry, posted revenues of $260.01 million for the quarter ended December 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.18%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $156.48 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.

 

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Bill.com shares have added about 9.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 7.3%.

Meanwhile, the January jobs report is on tap Friday morning. 

 The stock market rally generally advanced yet again, but with some divergence. The Nasdaq surged as **Meta Platforms** (**META**) spiked 23%. The S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 also had strong gains, but the Dow Jones edged lower.

Other techs followed Meta, with GOOGL stock, Amazon, **Microsoft** (**MSFT**) and **Apple** ([**AAPL**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) all retaking their 200-day lines.

The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 backed off midafternoon highs, as some of the hottest stocks such as **Tesla** (**TSLA**) pared gains. But the indexes shored up support heading into the close.

Still, the market rally could be due for a breather or pullback, after such strong gains in recent days. Along with Thursday night's megacap earnings, Friday's jobs report is on tap.

## Key Earnings

Apple, Google, Amazon, **Qualcomm** (**QCOM**) and **Ford Motor** ([**F**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=F)) all reported after Thursday's close.

**Apple earnings and revenue** fell short. AAPL stock fell 3% in extended action. Shares popped 3.7% to 150.82 on Thursday, closing above its 200-day line for the first time in nearly five months. But Apple stock could test or undercut that key level on Friday.

**Amazon earnings** slightly missed while revenue topped. The e-commerce and cloud-computing giant's Q1 revenue guidance midpoint was below consensus, with Amazon Web Services growth set to slow further. AMZN stock fell 5% overnight, signaling a move back below the 200-day line. Shares jumped 7.4% to 112.91 on Thursday.

**Google earnings and revenue** slightly missed views. GOOGL stock declined almost 5% in extended action. Shares leapt 7.3% to 107.74, topping its 200-day line for the first time in 10 months.

Qualcomm earnings squeaked past views while revenue slightly missed. Guidance for the current quarter was generally lower than consensus. QCOM stock retreated 3% overnight. Shares fell 1.9% to 135.85 on Thursday, after fellow Apple-and-5G chipmaker **Qorvo** (**QRVO**) tumbled on weak guidance. Qualcomm stock climbed 3.9% Wednesday, extending its move above the 200-day line.

Ford earnings fell short, with the auto giant saying it left $2 billion ""on the table."" Ford stock tumbled in extended trade. Shares had rallied 4% to 14.34 on Thursday, nearing a 14.77 buy point from a **double-bottom base**. On Thursday morning, Ford reported January U.S. sales, amid better-than-expected industrywide sales to start 2023.

There are several ways you can view a broken wing butterfly.¬†

You can view it as an unbalanced butterfly where the strikes of the long butterfly aren‚Äôt equidistant from the short strike making one wider than the other.¬†

Another way to view this strategy is the combination of a credit spread and a debit spread with the same short strike. The credit spread will be wider than the debit spread, typically allowing you to collect a net credit.¬†

Another way to view this strategy is a ratio spread with a further OTM long contract to define your risk.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

How to set it up:

Broken wing butterflies can be set up with either calls or puts, but for simplicity's sake, we will cover an example of setting up a put broken wing butterfly.¬†

The first step is to go to the OTM put strikes and sell two of the same strike contracts. A common way to determine which strike is by using delta. Most options traders like to trade broken wing butterflies with the short strike somewhere between 20 to 50 delta.¬†

Once you sell the short strikes, you must buy two puts. One will be below the short strike and the other above.¬†

For example, if your short strike is 100, you can buy a 105 put and a 90 put. In this case, you will have a 105/100 put debit spread and a 100/90 put credit spread.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros/Cons:

Every options strategy comes with its own pros and cons. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of the broken wing butterfly can help you make more informed decisions.¬†

#### Pros

* Hedged against volatility more than a credit spread
* Ability to take half the trade off at a time
* Potential to make money on both the credit spread and debit spread

#### Cons

* High commissions since it is a 4-leg strategy
* Lower credit collected than a credit spread

Options vega is the amount the premium of an option will increase when volatility increases by 1%. In other words, options vega measures the sensitivity of an option to changes in implied volatility.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

How Time Affects Options Vega:

Options with a further expiration date have higher vega. Therefore, options with a further expiration are more sensitive to changes in implied volatility.

However, when you trade options with a further expiration date, the gamma risk is also lower, which helps negate the effect of the higher vega values.

&amp;#x200B;

Postive/Negative Vega:

If you are selling options, your position vega will be negative. A negative position vega signifies that you will make money when implied volatility decreases.¬†

If you are long options, your position vega will be positive, signifying that you will make money with an increase in implied volatility ceteris paribus.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Vega Bottom Line:

ATM options and options with longer expiration dates have the highest vega values due to their high extrinsic value.¬†

As an option seller, your position vega will be negative, while option buyers will have a positive position vega. Option sellers make money when implied volatility decreases and vice versa.¬†

221,StockMarket,"If you want to start trading options, its crucial to understand the difference between buying and selling.

Buying Options:

Buying options gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price (strike price) on or before a specified date (expiration date). The buyer of an option pays a premium to the seller for this right. 

&amp;#x200B;

Buying Puts (Bearish):

Buying puts is a bearish strategy generally used to hedge long positions or speculate on a drop in equities. Buying puts is also a long volatility strategy so if you believe fear will increase in the markets, buying puts is a good strategy.¬† 

Buying Calls (Bullish): 

Traders will buy call options to replicate a long stock portfolio with less capital. For example, if you are bullish on Apple, instead of buying 100 shares, you can buy a call option for much less money.

The downside of buying calls is that there is an expiration date. You can hold shares forever, but call options will eventually expire. 

&amp;#x200B;

Selling Options:

The seller of an option is obligated to sell or buy the underlying asset at the strike price if the buyer of the option chooses to exercise their right. The seller receives the premium from the buyer as compensation for taking on this obligation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Selling Puts (Bullish):

Selling puts is a bullish strategy where you collect a premium in exchange for the obligation to buy 100 shares of stock at the strike price. Traders often utilize the cash-secured put strategy when selling puts.¬†

Selling Calls (Bearish): 

Traders generally only sell calls when they already own 100 shares of stock, making it a [covered call strategy](https://haikhuu.com/education/covered-call-strategy-for-income).¬†

Selling calls without owning shares requires a high-tier margin account since it theoretically comes with unlimited risk.

This represents a 37% increase in volume when contrasted with the 14,583 call options routinely traded daily. (source: [Market Beat](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-jwn-options-data-report-2023-01-20/))

Technically minded investors may see some opportunity in the chart (bottoming, consolidation into a falling wedge) along with optimism in the general stock market with the Fed's lower rate hike this week. The RSI has also been consistently chopping in the almost-oversold region, possibly indicating some upward momentum. 

https://preview.redd.it/ma8eytxjxsfa1.png?width=2428&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9085cad6c76f133ba1ffb980e500376300e90285

However, Nordstrom also faces significant challenges, including increasing competition from both traditional retailers and online-only players, changing consumer preferences and behaviors, and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, Nordstrom has struggled in recent years, with declining sales and profitability. Nordstrom's previously weak holiday sales may also be cause to want to hedge against negative price movements.

Looking forward, Nordstrom's success will likely depend on its ability to effectively adapt to the changing retail landscape and compete in an increasingly challenging market. This may involve investing in technology and logistics, streamlining its operations, and improving its marketing and customer experience. Overall, Nordstrom's future success will likely depend on its ability to effectively balance the need to maintain its traditional strengths while also embracing new and innovative strategies to remain relevant in a rapidly evolving industry.

247,StockMarket,"Hello All,

I have coded a tool in Pine Script (the coding language of Trading View) which gives the probability of a move in % for any asset.

**Why is knowing the probability important?**  
Because trading options becomes a process driven exercise and not an exercise based on gut feeling alone. However, knowing the probability doesn't mean it will guarantee the outcome (a Win or Loss). It does guarantee that over time, your wins and losses will be closer to the probabilities that you trade. For example, if a move has a probability of 95%, it doesn't guarantee that it will happen, because there's still a 5% chance that it won't. But, if over time you trade **ONLY** 95% probability events, your wins will be closer to 95%!

**How does knowing the probability help with trading options?**  
So the options market prices the options based on probabilities. There's a theory that the sum of the premiums of the call and put options for the **AT THE MONEY (ATM) strike**, divided by the strike price, gives a fairly decent estimate of the expected move in the underlying. **For example, the strike price of an asset is 500, and the 500 call option has a premium of 10 and the 500 put option has a premium of 10, the total premium is 20. This total premium is then divided by the strike price of 500 to give a percentage of 4%. That is the move the options market expects in the asset on either side**. Note, there are multiple sources which say that the total premium to be used ranges from 75 - 95% to estimate the expected percentage move in the asset. I prefer to use 100% of the total premium, as it gives some cushioning. So once we figure out the expected move by the options market, we can use that to figure out the probability of the move happening based on my tool.

For the Option Buyers in AMZN

As AMZN results are expected post market hours today, the options market expects a move of about 7.6% for the options expiring on the 3rd of Feb. And as per my tool on Trading View, **the probability of AMZN moving more than 7.5% by the 3rd of Feb. is only 18% (See Image Below).** That means, there's high probability (82%) that you will lose money if the market does not move by at least 7.5% by the 3rd of Feb.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iuj1cjc87sfa1.png?width=1490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5822d3432acf81a6e0495126e6a0a59f1f5af3b7

**However, as I said earlier, this only gives the probability of the move happening, it does not guarantee that a move will happen or not. A very good example - META! The options market were expecting a 9.15% move for the options expiring on the 3rd of Feb. The probability of META moving that much was ONLY 4%! But, it still did move waaaaay beyond 9.15%! (See Image Below).**

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img gpf7kmb97sfa1...*

**So then how does knowing the probability actually help? What gives?**  
Well, like I said earlier, knowing the probabilities will help over time and bring your wins and losses closer to the probabilities you trade. **For example, when probabilities of events happening are low, the options for those assets can be written using credit spreads or naked (depending on one's risk appetite). The premium from these credit trades can be used to to buy options or debit spreads (depending on one's preference) in assets whose probabilities are much higher.**

**Note - the trades here will always be short straddles (sell the CE and PE at ATM strike, in equal quantities), when selling, and long strangles (buy the CE and PE at strikes that are 1 - 2 strikes away from ATM, in equal quantities), when buying.**

**The options market priced NFLX to move about 1.55% for the options expiring on the 3rd of Feb. That is a 95% probability event! (See Image Below).**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cj55umaa7sfa1.png?width=1490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1a8d06c33ca456f59b6564c1ebb21db3e325e355

So a prudent trade would have been to short META ATM CE and PE options and long NFLX CE and PE options 1 - 2 strikes away from the ATM. (A short straddle on META ATM Strike and a Long Strangle on NFLX, 1 - 2 strikes away from ATM). And yes, the META trade would/will give a massive loss, but it would be a 3X or 4X of the premiums credited. However, if NFLX does move over 1.6% (either side) before the expiry on the 3rd of Feb., the NFLX debit trade could yield a 2X or 3X.

The above was an example of how this tool can effectively be used to trade both the sides. But if someone just wants to buy options, then it makes sense to just trade the high probability trades.

**ENDING NOTE**

The tool that I have coded is still being tested and hence I have not published it on Trading View as yet. It is a private script. However, Redditors can ask me to look up **ANY assets along with the expiry date of the options** and I can give them the probability and will also keep a track of how does it play out. It will help in actually testing out the tool in live markets.

Please let me know if you have any questions!

Thanks :D",Option Buyers in AMZN - This is for you (some of it),1675346374
248,StockMarket,"ChatGPT is undoubtedly one of the fastest growing apps of recent times, and its rise is heating up the generative AI circuit.

 

https://preview.redd.it/0z3skqe03sfa1.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ffa7a2f655df82d0db9fb3fb0cbb5f0d72eb3a85

On Wednesday, UBS released a research note showing that OpenAI's ChatGPT had reached an estimated 100 million monthly active users in January, just two months after its launch, making it the fastest growing consumer app in history.

Ubs analyst Lloyd Walmsley, citing data from analytics firm Similar Web, said ChatGPT was used by about 13 million unique visitors a day in January, more than double the number in December and an expansion rate never seen before:

TikTok took about nine months from launch to reach 100 million users, while Meta's Instagram took about 2.5 years. We can't remember an app that has expanded so quickly.

 

https://preview.redd.it/6xygwic13sfa1.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1812f70bd832808531a80118e05d4447b028613b

He points to investor estimates that the market for generative AI apps like ChatGPT could be as high as $1 trillion:

There are more than 1 billion knowledge workers in the world, and OpenAI's ChatGPT Pro costs $42 a month. If you assume that each of those people has two accounts -- a regular account and a professional account -- you get close to $1 trillion.

This seems like a crazy bullish scenario, with pricing likely to come down, but our core view is that the market potential is very high.

While ChatGPT was growing rapidly, Silicon Valley's Internet giants were also on the move. Walmsley expects generative AI applications to be a ""major theme"" when Google parent Alphabet reports its December quarter financial results on Thursday.

Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have reportedly returned to the company to speed up the rollout of new artificial intelligence features.

In addition, Microsoft struck a deal a week ago to expand its investment in OpenAI, which could reach $10 billion over the next few years. It has also been reported that Microsoft's Bing search engine is ""preparing"" to add a ""faster and richer"" version of ChatGPT called GPT-4 in the coming weeks.

At the same time, there are signs that a buying spree around generative AI applications is beginning.

C3.ai, an enterprise software company that develops analytics software tools for large enterprises, has seen its shares rise more than 90 percent in the past month. Shares have surged 26 per cent in the past two trading days after the company announced plans to launch a new natural language search service for enterprise software applications including ChatGPT.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in an interview that C3.ai is ""actively looking to protect its turf against competition from big tech"" :

The 10-year Treasury yield fell 2.821% to 3.509%, with a gap of -69 basis points over the two-year yield. The VIX fell 7.89%, Brent crude closed down 2.88%, and spot gold, which has been rising since Nov 2022, closed up 1.14% yesterday at $1,950.21 an ounce. The dollar index continued to retreat from its highs to close at 101.14.

.

Federal Reserve Committee statement and Chairman Powell's conference, unanimously agreed to raise interest rates 25bps to 4.50%-4.75% range, ""continue to raise interest rates"" wording remains unchanged but will consider financial conditions. They will discuss a few more rate hikes before a pause, this is not the year to cut rates. Economic growth slowed significantly last year; and will continue to be moderate. Inflation can fall back to 2 % without a serious recession. Inflation has moderated but remains high.

WISH rose 3.94% after it cuts nearly 17% of global workforce. Meanwhile, Wish introduces flat rate shipping to customers in the U.S. The move is part of a broader effort to improve the shipping experience on Wish which has, in the past 6 months alone, seen a dramatic improvement in on-time delivery rates (94%) and a significant reduction in time to door (15 days in key markets). Given the catalyst of cost cutting and improved shipping experiences, together with trending down inflation, Wish is positioned well to outperform the market in the near term.

Meta shares popped 20.17% in the after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter revenue that topped estimates and announced a $40 billion stock buyback. Here are the results.

* Earnings: $1.76 per share vs $2.22 expected  

* Revenue: $32.17 billion vs $31.53 billion expected  

* Daily Active Users (DAUs): 2 billion vs 1.99 billion expected  

* Monthly Active Users (MAUs): 2.96 billion vs 2.98 billion expected  

* Average Revenue per User (ARPU): $10.86 vs $10.63 expected

The company expects that its total expenses in 2023 will be in the range of $89 billion to $95 billion, which is lower than its prior outlook of $94 billion to $100 billion for the year. Meta attributed the adjustment to ‚Äúslower anticipated growth in payroll expenses and cost of revenue.‚Äù The cost cutting is what many investors are looking for and that partially explains why the stock is rising 20% in the after hour trading.

**Opportunities**

Market rises after the Federal Reserve raised rates by 25 basis points, or 0.25%, as was widely expected on Wednesday.

I personally saw the product but being in my 30's the appeal isn't really there and I thought 10$ for a bottle of coconut water seemed extra.

330,StockMarket," **Elevator pitch**

* REC     Silicon is a leader in silane-based, high-purity silicon materials.   In   fact, REC is the only large-scale producer of silane gas in U.S.   and   Europe.
* Two     highly strategic assets (Moses Lake, Washington and Butte, Montana)   in   rapidly expanding industries (megatrends) that should benefit from     lasting political tailwinds and strong profitability outlook. The     industries being solar, semiconductors and batteries (Thus, the     three-legged reference).
* Hydropower-based clean energy and low carbon footprint.
* 15% ownership share of a polysilicon plant in Yulin, China.
* Listed on the Norwegian stock exchange with ticker RECSI. Included in the OBX index which holds the 25 most liquid companies.
* Unknown     to most U.S. retail investors, most likely because it is a Norwegian     company. Workforce are U.S. based, including management and of  course    the assets.
* Broke     their neck with the U.S. and China trade wars and their Moses Lake     plant, valued at 1.7 billion USD, had to shut down. And this is where  it    gets interesting, because things have changed. The plant is now     scheduled for a restart second half this year, 2023! **So, what happened?**

**Six big things happened.**

1. The     world has changed, caused by geopolitical tension, and disruption in     supply chains, such as semiconductors and solar, poses a risk to     national security. More and more protectionism are introduced in both     the U.S. and Europe, and we are witnessing the importance of domestic     manufacturing and supply chains.
2. The     Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law in 2022, resulting    in  REC Silicon receiving a credit of $3 per kg polysilicon produced -     approximately 50 mUSD per year.
3. The     Chips and Science got signed into law. Spurred by the passage of  this    bill we see a huge boost in the American semiconductor industry.  REC    Silicon\`s facility in Butte, MT, has been recognized by the  White  House   as a potential candidate for domestic expansion of silane  gas   production  ([https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/](https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/)).
4. Senate     Bill 5849 by Judy Warnick, Moses Lake. Extending a targeted 43%     business and occupation tax cut for manufacturers of solar panels and     components another five years past the original expiration date of 2027     to 2032. In addition, the bill would allow for the construction or     improvement of existing industrial buildings.
5. Hanwha     Group, more specific Hanwha Solutions and Hanwha Corporation,   recently   became the biggest shareholders in REC Silicon, now   controlling 33%.   Hanwha Q CELLS, another company under the Hanwha   umbrella, is one of the   world's largest and most recognized   manufacturers for its  high-quality,  high efficiency solar cells and   modules. Q CELLS recently  announced the  largest investment of its kind   in U.S. history, and will  invest  billions in Georgia to create a   complete solar supply chain in  the  United States. Hanwha's stake in   REC Silicon marks the re-birth of  U.S.  polysilicon.
6. Silicon     anodes for better batteries are materializing. It has been the talk    the  last couple of years, but finally, it is happening. It is safe to    say  that this creates an even more solid foundation for the company.  As   the  former CEO once said ***They (the battery makers) have to come to us, or go to China.***     And to directly reference their website; REC Silicon‚Äôs silane is the     material of choice for lithium-ion batteries - and REC is a global     leader in silane-based materials.

**EV/Batteries**

With    REC Silicon holding this highly strategic position in the supply   chain,   prominent players are setting up shop in Moses Lake,   Washington. In  fact, right next door, and are becoming neighbours (See   image posted   below).

There is   not a whole lot   official information from the company about this   situation, yet. We   believe it is just a matter of time before more   information are made   available and public. Below is a curated list of   what we know this far.

* October 2020 - Group14 &amp; REC Silicon announced they are teaming up to meet demand for the ""Electrification of Everything"" ([https://group14.technology/en/news/group14-rec-silicon-plan-us-factory-to-meet-demand-for-the-electrification-of-everything](https://group14.technology/en/news/group14-rec-silicon-plan-us-factory-to-meet-demand-for-the-electrification-of-everything)).
* December     2022 - Group14 submits an application for the construction of a    factory in Moses Lake. They mean business and are coming to town (See    image  posted below). In addition to this, they closes another funding    round, representing one of top 10 largest climate tech raises in 2022.

* May     2022 - Sila Nanotechnologies has purchased its first standalone     factory, a 600,000-square-foot facility in Moses Lake (See image posted     below). Sila are backed by Mercedes and BMW, and are set to deliver     batteries for the new G Wagon, among others ([https://www.silanano.com/press/news/sila-purchases-battery-facility-in-moses-lake](https://www.silanano.com/press/news/sila-purchases-battery-facility-in-moses-lake)).

**Solar**

REC     Silicon's solar grade polysilicon is used in the manufacturing of    solar  ingots and wafers. Wafers are made into solar cells, and then    solar  panels. By using Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR) technology, using    one-tenth  of the electricity needed for Siemens technology, affords    low-cost  material and ultra-low carbon footprint, making its solar    module value  chain more sustainable. FBR is the patented technology of    the company,  and makes it possible produce solar-grade polysilicon in  a   continuous,  rather than a batch, process. This makes REC Silicon  one   of the most  efficient producers of solar-grade silicon in the  world,   and their  product is some of the least expensive silicon  available for   solar  panels.

Using    hydropower-based  clean energy, REC Silicon produces low-carbon    polysilicon without  emitting greenhouse gases. Compared to carbon-heavy    polysilicon  manufactured overseas that often relies on coal power,   REC  Silicon's  ‚Äúclean polysilicon‚Äù is expected to draw more demand in   the  coming years  as international scrutiny over industrial emissions   and  carbon  footprints grows.

A   quick  recap.  REC Silicon's biggest plant shut down in 2019. Without   access to  Chinese  market, their lifeline got cut off. There was no   solar module  value  chain outside of China. Now, almost four years   later, things are  looking  brighter. Solar module value chains are   forming in both the  U.S. and  Europe. REC Silicon is teaming up with   Hanwha Q CELLS, for  delivery of  solar grade polysilicon. As of this   writing, they have  ongoing  negotiations with Hanwha Solutions towards   reaching an offtake  agreement  for all FBR polysilicon production ([https://recsilicon.com/news-article/?slug=rec-silicon-update-of-restart-and-offtake-activities-in-moses-lake](https://recsilicon.com/news-article/?slug=rec-silicon-update-of-restart-and-offtake-activities-in-moses-lake)).     With Hanwha Q CELLS being one of the most trusted names, and   ambitious   companies in the solar industry, this is of course   promising.

Ever   since Hanwha   became the largest shareholder, they have been promoting   REC Silicon   as a vital part of their bigger plan. The importance of  this  newborn   partnership is certainly no secret to Hanwha, and this is   highlighted   by the statements below.

&gt;*This     year, Hanwha also acquired REC Silicon, a crucial step along the     company‚Äôs path to building out a full solar value chain, and expanded     its plans for its green energy businesses in the U.S. thanks to the     incentives in the groundbreaking Inflation Reduction Act.*([https://www.hanwha.com/en/news\_and\_media/stories/sustainability/hanwhas-year-in-review-2022.html).-----](https://www.hanwha.com/en/news_and_media/stories/sustainability/hanwhas-year-in-review-2022.html).-----)*By     investing in REC Silicon, with US plants that produce special gas  for    semiconductor as well as polysilicon, we are expanding our  business   into  high value‚Äìadded core industrial materials.* ([https://www.hanwha.com/en/products\_and\_services/chemicals-materials.html).-----](https://www.hanwha.com/en/products_and_services/chemicals-materials.html).-----)*By     becoming the largest shareholder of REC Silicon, Hanwha will expand    its  renewable energy portfolio in the U.S. and help American  businesses    secure raw material critical to the solar supply chain. As  global    competition over clean energy sources intensifies in the  coming years,    Hanwha will work towards establishing a highly  efficient, low-carbon    system to boost clean energy technology.*\-----*Hanwha     Solutions‚Äô strategic investment in REC Silicon represents a step     towards establishing a highly efficient, low carbon solar value chain in     the US and to ensure that REC Silicon plays an integral role in  these    efforts. Hanwha Solutions‚Äô knowledge, expertise, and  capabilities are    expected to enhance REC Silicon‚Äôs ability to take  advantage of    opportunities and developing markets in the solar,  semiconductor, and    battery industries.* ([https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/11/18/2336964/0/en/REC-Silicon-ASA-Strategic-equity-investment-by-Hanwha-Solutions.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/11/18/2336964/0/en/REC-Silicon-ASA-Strategic-equity-investment-by-Hanwha-Solutions.html)).

Lets end this solar section with a statement from Joe Biden, on the Hanwha Q CELLS investment decision ([https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/11/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-hanwha-q-cells-announcement/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/11/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-hanwha-q-cells-announcement/)).

**Semiconductors**

REC     Silicon\`s electronic grade certified polysilicon businesses provide a     variety of form factors for uses in high-tech energy and electronics     industries. From motor control and power conversion processes for   hybrid   and electric vehicles, wind energy, and high voltage   transmission, 5G   communications, high-speed trains, IoT (internet of   things), and big   data to manufacturing of 12‚Äô semiconductor wafers   used in memory   processors, optics, and micro electromechanical systems   (MEMS).

The   Chips and Science   got signed into law. Spurred by the passage of this   bill we are   expecting to see a huge boost in the American semiconductor   industry.   REC Silicon's facility in Butte, MT, has been recognized by   the White   House as a potential candidate for domestic expansion of  silane gas   production ([https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/](https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/)).

While     the company is not set to benefit directly from this specific Chips    and  Science act (unlike the IRA),  this will nevertheless create    conditions  that are intended to boost demand for REC's electronic-grade    silicon.  The Chips and Science Act is intended to expand domestic    production of  semiconductor chips, which are made out of    electronic-grade silicon that  the company produces at its facility in    Butte, Montana.

**Stock price and valuation**

**Ticker  RECSI**,   Norwegian Stock Exchange. Included in the OBX index which holds   the   25 most liquid companies. Heavily traded and volatile. A  significant    number of retail investors owns this stock in Norway. They  have    recognized the seemingly limited downside, and huge upside. REC     Silicon\`s foundation is stronger then ever due to recent developments in     both the political and the industrial landscape. We are slowly     identifying larger investors taking place. But the stock will continue     to be volatile and manipulated by strong traders. We have never seen     treeshakes like this, and there is a great deal of psychology in play.     But we expect the float to change when contracts are signed, and we   also   expect the stock to reprice significantly.

* As of this writing the stock price is NOK 14 (1.4 USD), which values the company at 586 mUSD
* Assuming 100% capacity we are looking at an annual EBITDA range of 200-400 mUSD by 2025.
* Moses Lake plant valued at 1.7 billion USD about to restart (valued at 0 in the company's accounts due to amortization)
* For     a business with strategic products for the U.S. solar industry and   the   lithium-ion battery markets, and the know-how and experience to    consider  avenues for deeper expansion into these rapidly growing    industries, we  believe REC could have potential to command much higher    EBITDA multiples  then what the current market valuation implies at  the   time of this  writing (&lt;3x EV/EBITDA)
* Under     the new IRA law, REC Silicon will be eligible for a $3-per-kilogram     refundable tax credit for every kilogram of solar-grade silicon the     company sells. This will have a favorable impact of $48 million per  year    at full production.
* Potential to command a very large premium on selling silane gas to anode producers.
* REC     is uniquely positioned with two highly strategic assets in rapidly     expanding industries that should benefit from lasting political     tailwinds, strong profitability outlook and attractive funding     opportunities
* Needless     to say, there is upside potential for this stock. Recent investment     behaviour of several anode producers are clearly indicating that a  blue    sky scenario is about to materialize for REC Silicon's. In this     scenario, Norwegian brokers have indicated a fair value of NOK 50-70     (5-7 USD).

**Potential short term triggers**

* Signed contract with Hanwha for delivery of solar-grade polysilicon
* Signed contracts with anode and battery producers
* Project Riser (More on this later)
* Yulin IPO China (REC Silicons's 15% valued at around 180 mUSD)
* Grant     from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the development of a     supply chain for next generation batteries (REC has been recognized by     the White House as a potential candidate for domestic expansion of     silane gas production). And REC has the past two years been a     participant in several meetings with the DOE for securing solar and     batteries in the U.S.

In it‚Äôs 2023 strategic update, Albemarle ‚Äì the 3rd largest lithium producer in the world, updated its global lithium demand (LCE, lithium carbonate equivalent) projections to 3.7 million tones by 2030. It was a 15% increase from its previous forecast due to the impact of the US ‚Äúinflation reduction act‚Äù and strong EV demand.

This forecast represents 30% annual lithium demand growth till the end of the decade ‚Äì the strongest growth runways among all metals.

https://preview.redd.it/9pbidltsblfa1.png?width=702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7c90f5233e130e04cd8c01ec365352838ada40d4

**Lithium Supply Will Struggle to Keep Pace with Demand**

Albemarle stated that lower grade, higher cost projects will be required to fill that growing demand gap. Bringing on new capacity requires extensive time and resources, starting with early exploration and target testing (3-6 years) to engineering and economic studies (6-7 years) to construction and initial production (0.5 to 2 years). Recent hard rock mining projects have taken up to 10 years to start of production; integrated projects come in at around 14 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Benchmark Mineral Intelligence ‚Äì one of the top consulting agencies for battery metals forecasts demand to be 2.4 million tonnes by 2030, notably lower than Albemarle‚Äôs forecast. However Benchmark‚Äôs base case lithium supply forecast for 2030 is 2.1 million tonnes ‚Äì which is materially below Albemarle‚Äôs 3.7 million demand forecast.

https://preview.redd.it/4p6znk9yblfa1.png?width=497&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=18478bc92058d4e503d0cef911dfd874f9f6e3c4

This projected significant supply shortfall presents a very bullish backdrop for lithium prices over the long-term. Lithium prices have risen 200% in the last year alone.

https://preview.redd.it/khvnoax5clfa1.png?width=712&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=22a32e28019632d0c8ac9f47afd7945636b72f86

**Canada will Play a Key Role in the World‚Äôs Future Lithium Supply**

Currently, almost all lithium mining occurs in Australia, Latin America, and China, accounting for a combined 98 percent of production in 2020. Additional lithium sources required to bridge the supply gap are predicted to come from early-stage conventional mineral and brines projects, as yet unknown resources, and unconventional brines such as geothermal or oilfield brines.

&amp;#x200B;

To meet surging lithium global demand, conventional lithium assets from the U.S., Mexico and Canada will be required to come into production.

https://preview.redd.it/8o08wi4kclfa1.png?width=660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1ae59b9628eee7d6e60e25d1633c733671478ac5

Canada has the 7th largest lithium reserves in the world with 0.8 million metric tons. The country will play a key role in supply lithium to the world ‚Äì with a national government highly supportive of critical metals development.

&amp;#x200B;

The Canadian government is hoping to capitalize on the opportunity this poses with a new critical minerals strategy ‚Äî backed with $4 billion in funding in the recent federal budget ‚Äî that aims to develop a full critical minerals industry value chain, from exploration and mining, to processing, manufacturing and recycling.

&amp;#x200B;

Clean Energy Canada estimates $5.7 billion to $24 billion in GDP could be created by 2030 annually by developing a battery supply chain, creating 18,500 to 81,000 direct jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/59xhn3mpclfa1.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=38881cf3e932a3ad7d440ef578efb075bb6cc95b

Ottawa is also anticipating that their Canadian critical minerals industry can benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act and other American policies which will inject billions into electric vehicles. This will potentially create opportunities for cross-border cooperation on the development of North American supply chains.

&amp;#x200B;

In our note today we are taking a look at two Canadian mining companies with what we believe are exceptional lithium prospects: Grid Metals and Stria Lithium.

&amp;#x200B;

**Grid Metals: Unique Production Agreement and Major Potential**

Grid Metals (TSXV:GRDM) is a lithium, nickel and copper producer exploring in Southern Manitoba.

https://preview.redd.it/s2jqtf27dlfa1.png?width=646&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c1549c4906e4ea83cd2e6277969301594ec43480

What makes Grid so interesting to us is the company‚Äôs pre-production agreement with the only operating lithium processing facility in Canada. Tanco, the owner of the facility is desperate for additional lithium resource to keep the processing circuit working for years to come. Because of Tanco‚Äôs need for additional lithium, Grid has a ready buyer for its lithium resource without having to spend large amounts of capital building processing facilities in-house.

&amp;#x200B;

Grid expects to receive an advanced exploration permit in 2023 so it can begin bulk sampling of the pegmatite dykes discovered at its Donner Lake property and will continue to drill and prove out lithium resources throughout the year.

https://preview.redd.it/iqqork7edlfa1.png?width=707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f57756310b126615673c9a0eee30d17a6d7deb06

Grid also has the largest land package in the Bird River Belt, an established battery metal mining area.

&amp;#x200B;

The company has already discovered a significant copper and nickel resource at the Makwa Mayville project and is now at the Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) stage which will determine the potential economic value of the resource and move the company towards signing commercial agreements with a potential acquirer or partner.

https://preview.redd.it/kd12qzjjdlfa1.png?width=701&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6aab275a98c8318fc3edcb4af6717f3f46297a79

**Stria Lithium: Owner of Underexplored Acreage in the Prolific James Bay Lithium District**

Stria Lithium (TSXV:SRA) is a small cap lithium miner that owns underexplored acreage in the heart of Quebec lithium country.

&amp;#x200B;

Stria is neighbor to multiple major lithium projects including world class drill results by Patriot Battery Metals at their Corvette project.

https://preview.redd.it/wcd9a39udlfa1.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6ea8af12375fdb3246b64004dde4cbeea41a88c6

Patriot identified drill samples of more than 200 meters with lithium concentrations above 2%. The best lithium mines in the world have estimated lithium concentrations around 1.5%-1.8% for reference.

https://preview.redd.it/3htrhzwiglfa1.png?width=657&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d770017449c0374a87a4e001b1ac0203ffc71710

In addition to big resource upside, Stria signed a smart deal with Cygnus Gold, an Australian explorer, who will pay for all exploration expenses in 2023 in exchange for up to a 70% ownership in Stria. As a result Stria is fully funded to execute on an ambitious drilling program this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Pontax Lithium is the company‚Äôs main asset and has already returned initial drill samples with high concetrations of lithium.

&amp;#x200B;

The company still has significant resource to prove out in all directions of the main Pontax Central pegamatite outcrop. A 10,000 meter drilling program is planned for 2023 which is a significant increase from the 1,500 meters drilled in 2022.

https://preview.redd.it/7ecfnjymglfa1.png?width=697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4f149bf74d215c3f7aeebbb317c41f8e90dbab8f

&amp;#x200B;

JACKSON CENTER, PA / ACCESSWIRE / January 31, 2023 / Halberd Corporation (OTC PINK:HALB) confirmed that animal testing at Mississippi State University (MSU) will focus on Halberd's patent-pending nasal spray to mitigate the effects of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), when administered shortly after sustaining a head Injury. The work will be conducted over the next several months under the direction of Dr. Russell Carr, of the College of Veterinary Medicine.

&amp;#x200B;

Following Halberd's in vitro successful eradication of each known antigen associated with head trauma, including TBI, in collaboration with Youngstown State University, in vivo studies are to commence at Mississippi State University. Funding for the program has already been approved.

&amp;#x200B;

Head trauma initiates a cascade of overproduction of certain proteins and inflammatory cytokines in the brain. This overproduction, depending on the magnitude of the injury, often manifests itself in neurological changes in behavior, such as PTSD, aggression and suicide ideation. Halberd's triple-action nasal spray is designed to counteract these TBI-related complications by blocking the overproduction mechanism and allowing the brain to recover naturally. The benefits of such an approach in treating head injuries to military personnel, contact sports athletes and ordinary people who experience head trauma are monumental.

&amp;#x200B;

Dr. Mitchell S. Felder, Halberd's Chief Technology Officer and a board-certified attending neurologist stated, ""We have been very impressed by the protocol for testing traumatic brain injury in animals by the professors at Mississippi State University. What sets Halberd's nasal spray treatment apart is the ability to administer the treatment soon after injury in any setting, thus reducing the potential for serious permanent neurological damage.""

&amp;#x200B;

William A. Hartman, Chairman, President &amp; CEO of Halberd Corporation, added, ""Selecting a source for animal testing of our anti-traumatic brain injury nasal spray was a very difficult process. Many universities we met with simply didn't have the process, experience, or expertise to conduct the tests in a manner that would yield our desired results. Mississippi State University has developed the procedures and delivered a test protocol that meets Halberd's rigid specifications. We look forward to a successful program with Mississippi State University.""

358,StockMarket,"The Federal Reserve is expected to slow rate hiking to 25 bps this time, but Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs speech after the decision matters more to investors: When the Fed will stop raising rates, whether the terminal rate will finally break 5%, and is there a rate cut later this year, etc. Powell‚Äôs attitude on current tightening, inflation downtrend and economy will be critical.

Stock market is off to a strong start in 2023, with S&amp;P 500 index rising more than 6% in January, tech-led Nasdaq Composite soared 10%, recording the best January since 2001. In other words, market is ""perfectly priced"" for Fed's pivot.

FedWatch shows that there is a 98.4% chance that Fed will raise rates by 25 bps today, putting the fed funds rates target rate range at 4.5% to 4.75%. The market is also ready for another 25 bps rate-hiking in March, then the central bank will stop raising rates (or no hiking in March to see further progress, then raise 25 bps in May‚Äôs meeting, and stop). In other words, the terminal rate will be 4.75-5%, and investors expect a 25 bps rate cut later this year. The consensus is quite ‚Äúdovish‚Äù compared with Fed‚Äôs expectation last December, which terminal rates will be above 5% and no rate cut this year.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3dxtnz1z0lfa1.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8c11f8bfce559115ddf70b67e4f0465ed1f5546e

Nick Timiraos, the WSJ reporter who precisely forecasted the Fed‚Äôs decision several times, pointed out that there is no doubt that the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points this week, but officials have voiced unease that prices could reaccelerate because labor markets are so tight. U.S. non-farm payrolls for December will be released this Friday, it will also be a main focus. Currently, the U.S. unemployment rate is just 3.5%, the lowest level in half a century.

Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers last week urged the Federal to refrain from signaling its next move after an expected interest-rate hike because of the economy‚Äôs highly uncertain outlook. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a time to be committing to rate hikes, given the indications of softness that we have seen from a number of quarters, and the possibility of rate increases shouldn‚Äôt be taken off the table‚Äù, he said.

‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs (Powell) going to be hawkish relative to market pricing.‚Äù said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, ‚ÄúHe wants to defend the validity of the 5% to 5.25% terminal rate \[forecast\]. At the same time, he sees record housing prices are coming down. Wage inflation is coming down. The auto sector is not doing great. Retail‚Äôs not doing so great. The jobs market is doing OK. Wage inflation is coming down but it‚Äôs still above comfort levels.‚Äù

It is worth mentioning that even Fed presses the ""pause button"" on rate-hiking, the central bank will stay the rate for a while, and they are still doing $95 billion a month in quantitative tightening. Overall, the total assets Fed holds are more than double compared with pre-pandemic level.

**Core PCE hit a 1-year low, but the service sector remains hot**

High inflation is still Fed‚Äôs No.1 concern on monetary tightening. CPI growth slowed to 6.5% year-over-year in December, cooling for sixth straight month; core PCE (Fed's preferred inflation measure) rose 4.4% y/y the lowest annual increase since October 2021, but still far above the target of 2%. The University of Michigan said one-year inflation expectations in its final January reading dropped to 3.9%, lowest since April 2021. Investors are confident that inflation will keep declining and Fed can slow the rate-hiking.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f60ori211lfa1.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3d22cb24067b13972af6bd0b4b9ad070fc490ea8

However, it should be noted that services sector in CPI report remains hot. In December CPI report, shelter, transportation and medical care services all rose m/m, offsetting the softness in energy and auto markets. Fed needs to battle inflation decisively, or it may rebound unexpectedly.

The side effect of rate-hiking is to dampen consumer demand as December retail sales fell 1.1% y/y, the largest decline in a year. But on the other hand, U.S. GDP rose 2.9% in the fourth quarter, released last week, better than 2.6% estimated, most U.S. stocks still posted better-than-expected Q4 earnings. Therefore, investors are more optimistic about soft landing, but also gives Powell‚Äôs room to remain hawkish.

Overall, Powell‚Äôs speech today will likely be hawkish, acknowledge the progress of battling inflation and assure the Fed will gradually raise rates to keep the balance between economy growth and falling inflation. But still, the timing for pivot is not ready yet.

369,StockMarket,"**OVERALL:**  The move uip over all of January and fact price is sitting just below (SPY), right at (IWM), or pierceing (IWM) major resistance levels suggests the markets will probably pullback from the Fed speech.  Then again, major events such as this speech can very easily blow past technical analysis probabilities...so we shall see.  Either way, from a swing trading perpective the volatility remains high, which is resulting in continued opportunites on both the long &amp; short side.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY:**  Index continues to 'lag' slightly behind the others.  Price traded generally within range from the previous 3x candles; bullish consolidation could be forming just beneath the major resistance TL, which is only weakening this TL the more it consolidations.  If it breaks out, next major resistance is a gap-window between 420 - 422.  Major support remains around 397 the bear channel ceiling.

**QQQ:** Price traded generally within range from the previous 2-3x candles; bullish consolidation could be forming beneath the major resistance TL, which is only weakening this TL the more it consolidations.  If it breaks out, next major resistance is 3111 pivot high.  Major support remains around 283 the bear channel ceiling. 

https://preview.redd.it/ul5yzgwnfkfa1.jpg?width=2314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d9c121c3c0bbfdae8bfea45cd30ef9f342d64330

**IWM**:  Surprisingly big move (and on average volume) considering the Fed speech this afternoon.  Had volume been lighter I maybe would've expected it.  Price shot through major resistance and must close above 191.58 to turn that TL into support.  Next major resistance is 196.00 which is a decade-old TL you can see if you do not factor in the COVID spike.  Major support remains around 181 which is the  former resistance TL from the bear chanel.

**Thesis:**  NatGas continues to slide, but the fall rate is definitely slowing.  I already have a 3.5% size position in UNG shares long with an average of $10.18 -- and with the slower fall rate, adding to that position is not going to bring my DCA down significantly.  Therefore, I added this options position to increase my exposure.  I chose a 0.33% position size so I can add to it two more times if IV or price action pushes the options down further.

**Type**: Buy to Open -- Options -- 6/16 $255.00 Calls  
**Symbol**:  AMGN  
**Entry Price**: 12.50  
**Entry Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis:**  Consistent and significant fall in price from recent ATHs.  Into several major support areas: 1) 250-250 pivot hights prior to the October price surge; 2) 61.8% Fib retrace from that price surge; 3) 200 DMA.  Price dropped 2% immediately AH but recovered over the course of the night to almost up 1%.  We will see how it behaves in the pre-market.  If this opens green, given the Fed speech this afternoon, I will likely close even if the move is not as big as I would've hoped...mainly because of how sharply it dropped right after the close.

385,StockMarket," Tesla lost over $140 million betting on Bitcoin last year, according to a Monday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The electric car manufacturer took a $204 million impairment charge while gaining $64 million through converting Bitcoin in 2022.

 ‚ÄúIn the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $204 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our Bitcoin and gains of $64 million on certain conversions of bitcoin into fiat currency by us,‚Äù Tesla said in the filing.

 An impairment charge describes a reduction or loss in the value of an asset. It can occur because of a change in economic circumstances, like the crypto winter that gripped the market after the collapse of Terra Luna in May 2022.

 The annual disclosure to the SEC comes less than a week after Tesla‚Äôs quarterly earnings report, which included no Bitcoin transactions but nonetheless saw the value of its holdings decline, generating a $43 million loss for the last four months of 2022.

In February 2021, Tesla invested a staggering $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, making it one of the largest corporate holders of the cryptocurrency‚Äîsecond only to MicroStrategy. At the time, Bitcoin traded at $46,364 per coin. By November 10, 2021, Bitcoin saw its all-time high of $69,044 per coin, according to CoinGecko.

But the good times did not last as Bitcoin, and the rest of the cryptocurrency market, went into freefall in 2022. As of January 31, 2023, Bitcoin is trading at around $23,051.

Tesla‚Äôs impairment losses nearly doubled since 2021 when, in an SEC filing that year, Tesla reported a $101 million impairment loss on digital assets and $128 million gains after selling Bitcoin in 2021.

By October 2022, Tesla reported to investors that the company still held over $218 million in Bitcoin after selling 75% of its holdings in July‚Äîaround $936 million at the time.

 ‚ÄúAs with any investment and consistent with how we manage fiat-based cash and cash-equivalent accounts, we may increase or decrease our holdings of digital assets at any time based on the needs of the business and our view of market and environmental conditions,‚Äù the company said in Monday‚Äôs filing.

In the filing, Tesla calls its Bitcoin holdings indefinite-lived intangible assets. These assets are periodically reviewed to determine if their value on the balance sheet exceeds their fair market value. As Tesla explained, these impairment charges may affect the company‚Äôs further investment in Bitcoin.

‚ÄúFor any digital assets held now or in the future, these charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase,‚Äù the company said.

Neither the quarterly earnings report nor the SEC filing identified any specific digital assets besides Bitcoin. The company is believed to hold Dogecoin, however, as it accepts the meme-coin as payment, and CEO Elon Musk is a self-avowed fan.",Tesla Details $140 Million Bitcoin Loss in SEC Filing,1675229405

It's a fundamental need to forecast the stock price for any investor. I always want to get market sentiments on a particular stock, going up or down in a day, week, or month.

The existing solution is analyst reports that are not free and only give a target price for the next 12 months. It's not helpful for short-term trading. I am looking for general market sentiment.

What if there is a tool to aggregate everyone's opinion on how the APPL price will close by the end of the day? Users can predict the stock price and correct prediction is rewarded.  


Assuming the game becomes big enough with 10k+ players, would you be interested to learn what percentage of users are predicting going up or down?

400,StockMarket,"Global stocks, interest rate-risky bonds and even thinly traded cryptocurrency markets are all heading into the new year with big gains. The rotation in risk appetite fueled a surge in cryptocurrencies, credit and stocks, heralding a potential showdown between the Federal Reserve and Wall Street, which is betting on what Jerome Powell will do next.

&amp;#x200B;

Fund managers are unleashing speculative bets on a soft landing for the U.S. economy even as the Federal Reserve appears poised to deliver a hawkish and hawkish message in support of restrictive monetary policy on Wednesday.

&amp;#x200B;

On Tuesday, local time, traders got fresh ammunition to push risky asset prices higher against the backdrop of weak labor market wage growth data, raising the possibility that the Federal Reserve may pause its tightening cycle or even reverse its policy.

&amp;#x200B;

The S&amp;P 500 ended the day higher, having risen as much as 6% in late January, its best start to the year since 2019. The once-slumping Nasdaq 100 rebounded in January, not seen in more than 20 years, rising more than 10%.

&amp;#x200B;

The buoyant market recovery ran counter to expectations for growth in U.S. Treasury debt and lower corporate earnings expectations, while also complicating efforts by the Federal Reserve to tighten policy to curb inflation.

&amp;#x200B;

""Markets are still swinging wildly between hope and disappointment, largely based on speculation about the nature of Powell's next interest rate policy announcement,"" said Ben Kumar, senior investment strategist at Seven Investment Management LLP.‚Äù","Global stock markets are off to a good start in 2023, what will the Fed do next?",1675217065

407,StockMarket," ‚ÄúMargin of Safety: Risk-Averse Value Investing Strategies for the Thoughtful Investor‚Äù by Seth Klarman is known for its high **price tag of $2,500**. Here are my top 10 takeaways from the book ‚ÄúMargin of Safety‚Äù by Seth Klarman:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Strive for a margin of safety**: When investing, always aim to purchase assets at a significant discount to their intrinsic value to protect against potential downside risk. This is especially critical in volatile or uncertain market conditions.
2. **Understand intrinsic value:** Know the true value of an investment, rather than relying on market prices or trends, to make informed decisions and avoid overpaying. By understanding intrinsic value, you can make better-informed decisions and avoid overpaying for an investment.
3. **Be a contrarian:** Seek out undervalued assets that the market may be overlooking, to find hidden gems with substantial growth potential.
4. **Mind the market psychology**: Understand how emotions and perceptions can influence market trends, so you can better anticipate market movements and make informed decisions.
5. **Be ready to act:** Don‚Äôt miss out on potential investments due to hesitation or procrastination. Be prepared to act when opportunities arise. By being ready to act, you can capitalize on market opportunities and achieve superior returns.
6. **Practice discipline:** True value investors must be unemotional and willing to hold onto their investments for the long term, even when others are panicking.
7. **Conduct due diligence:** Analyze the financial and qualitative aspects of a business, such as its management, competitive position, and industry trends, before making any investment decisions.
8. **Maintain a long-term perspective:** Focus on building wealth over time, rather than trying to make quick profits or time the market.
9. **Be patient:** Avoid hasty decisions and remain patient, even during short-term market fluctuations. This will help you avoid costly mistakes.
10. **Avoid speculation:** Steer clear of high-risk investments and focus on finding undervalued assets with a margin of safety for better returns in the long term.",10 lessons from the investing book ‚ÄúMargin of Safety‚Äù by Seth Klarman:,1675209245

410,StockMarket,"Either the Fed does what's right tomorrow and keeps the pace of rate hikes where it is at 50bps so the average person can live a decent life and not be railed by inflation or they simply don't give a sh\*t

The FED will report its policy decision tomorrow. Federal Reserve officials are widely expected to lower the pace of interest rates hikes by a quarter point at their meeting tomorrow .

I think this expectation is a bit too hopeful as the FED just dropped their pace of rate increases during the last meeting from 75 basis points to 50. Now the market is predicting another 25 bps drop, I simply do not buy it.

Now the market thinks we get another slowing of rate increases by 25bps, I don't see this happening. PCE inflation, which is the Fed's preferred metric of inflation, still rose last month.

Jerome Powell has said over and over again he needs the labor market to slow to be confident inflation is coming down. We just simply haven't seen that, as unemployment is still almost changed compared to pre -Covid.

‚ÄúThe labor force needs to get back into balance‚Äù , ‚ÄúJob opening came down - that's a positive thing‚Äù ‚ÄúLabor market can come back with a decline in job openings‚Äù - Powell two months ago.

Cut out the BS what does it mean. People need to lose their jobs for inflation to be able to come down, which hasn't happened enough yet to affect the labor market. Look I get it CPI has came off the highs just slightly, but at the end of the day the feds preferred measure of inflation moved higher last month and the jobs market is still strong.

Therefor I think market expectations are flat wrong and we wont see a decline in the pace of interest rates tomorrow.

If this goes the way I expect we could be setting up for a large move lower throughout the market tomorrow and the weeks to come, as always I'm positioned with my convictions.

The first quarter will likely mark a turning point for the market ‚Äì and its upward trajectory probably won‚Äôt continue, he said. 

‚ÄúThe  fundamental confirmation for the next leg higher might not come,‚Äù  Kolanovic said in a Monday note to investors. ‚ÄúAnd instead markets could  encounter an air-pocket of weaker earnings and activity as they move  through Q2 and Q3.‚Äù

He anticipates that the backdrop for corporate profits will start to turn lower as pricing power reverses.

The  strategist‚Äôs comments arrive as stocks take a breather from their  latest run. Still, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 5% for the year,  while the Nasdaq Composite has bounced more than 9%. The Dow Jones  Industrial Average is up about 2.3% in 2023.

Kolanovic also foresees a ‚Äúpostponement rather than fading of recession risk.‚Äù Though U.S. gross domestic product rose at an [annualized pace of 2.9%](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/26/gdp-q4-2022-us-gdp-rose-2point9percent-in-the-fourth-quarter-more-than-expected-even-as-recession-fears-loom.html)  in the fourth quarter, there is weakness underlying that headline  number, ‚Äúas private demand printed its weakest growth since the start of  the recovery,‚Äù the strategist said.

‚ÄúA weak trajectory for US  domestic demand keeps recession risk elevated, even as the tightness in  labor markets postpones this recession risk,‚Äù Kolanovic wrote.  ‚ÄúMeanwhile, restrictive real policy rates represent an ongoing headwind,  keeping the risk of a recession later in the year high.‚Äù","Don‚Äôt count on this early 2023 rally, says JPMorgan‚Äôs Kolanovic",1675181423

*****
&gt; Stock futures declined Tuesday as traders wrap up what has been a strong month for equities.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.3%, while futures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.4%, or 119 points. Nasdaq-100 futures dropped 0.5%.
*****
&gt; Caterpillar shares fell more than 2% in the premarket after the industrial giant posted its latest quarterly results. Meanwhile, General Motors shares jumped more than 4% in premarket trading after reporting strong earnings.
*****
&gt; Those moves build on Monday‚Äôs declines. The Dow lost 0.8% in the previous session, while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq Composite fell 1.30% and 1.96%, respectively.
*****
&gt; It‚Äôs been a stellar January for stocks, otherwise. As of Monday‚Äôs close, the S&amp;P 500 and Dow are up 4.64% and 1.72% in January, respectively, and headed for their third positive month in four. The S&amp;P 500 is also on track for its best January since 2019. The Nasdaq Composite has risen 8.86% this month, putting it on pace for its best monthly performance since July.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe reason I‚Äôve been optimistic on equities to start the year is because revisions are mostly behind us, people got too negative,‚Äù Trivariate Research‚Äôs Adam Parker told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell: Overtime‚Äù on Monday.
*****
&gt; A solid January could be a good sign for the market, and potentially foreshadow a continued uptick in the months that follow. Of the five instances in which the S&amp;P gained more than 5% in January after a negative year, the benchmark index rose 30% for the year on average, said Carson Group‚Äôs Ryan Detrick in a tweet.
*****
&gt; However, a busy week of earnings could put this recent rally in jeopardy. Investors are watching closely for comments on how some of the largest companies are faring amid high inflation and fears of slowing consumer spending.
*****
&gt; Attention also turns to the latest interest rate decision due out of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest policy meeting kicking off Tuesday. Traders widely expect a 25 basis point increase, but will monitor commentary for clues into how much further the Fed intends to hike, or when it plans to cut rates.

463,StockMarket," **Tesla** (**TSLA**), **Nvidia** (**NVDA**) and **Constellation Energy Group** (**CEG**) were the top three S&amp;P 500 index losers on the **stock market today**, as growth stocks led Monday's declines after soaring the past few weeks. 

 The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.3% on Monday, while the Nasdaq composite shed almost 2%, back below its 200-day moving average. TSLA stock and Nvidia are big Nasdaq 100 components.

Tesla stock tumbled 6.3% to 166.66 on Monday. But that was less than half of Friday's 11% spike, and just a fraction of last week's 33% surge. TSLA stock had surged 75% from its bear market low of 101.08 to Friday's close. Shares are still comfortably above the 50-day line, but are still well below their 200-day moving average.

Tesla this month slashed prices worldwide. The move has revived demand for its EVs, though already-falling gross margins will likely take a hit. Tesla on Monday began offering some $3,000 worth of new trade-in incentives for Model S and X vehicles, just over two weeks after slashing prices on those luxury EVs by 9%-15%.

Nvidia stock skidded 5.9% to 191.62. But that's after surging 47% from a recent low on Dec. 28. NVDA stock is now technically back in **buy range** from a **cup base** with a 188 entry.

 Constellation Energy stock sank 4.8% to 82.40. Unlike Tesla and Nvidia stock, the nuclear power and renewable energy giant is down 4.4% so far in 2023. CEG stock peaked at 97.89 on Nov. 23. Constellation Energy is in a consolidation with a 97.99 **buy point**, but the stock is below a now-falling 50-day line.","Tesla, Nvidia Lead Today's Biggest S&amp;P 500 Stock Market Losers",1675148347

We screen for the top 1-6 month overwriting candidates based on our 18-year study as well as our analysts‚Äô fundamental ratings and price targets. We identify the most attractive stocks to overwrite for February expiration based on the screen (Exhibit 4). For 3-6 month overwrites, we highlight the top 50 opportunities based on our analysts‚Äô price targets as well as the top 50 put selling candidates based on our analysts‚Äô estimates.

* ***Call selling underperformed by 37bps while put selling outperformed by 50bps since Jan expiration.***  
We calculate the average return for a portfolio of 362 stocks in the US market that we believe are liquid (as identified by tight bid/ask spreads for 10% OTM calls). We observed that call selling outperformed a long stock strategy only in months with moderate to down stock performance, whereas put selling outperformed in most of the months except those with sharp market sell-offs. See Exhibit 2.
* ***Buy-write portfolio (call sale + long stock) is up 3.8% since Jan expiration.***  
We simulate owning stock and selling 10% OTM Feb calls as of Jan expiration. We track this portfolio through the month to see how single stock overwriting has performed. We estimate this portfolio is up 3.8% compared to the average stock performance of up 4.2%. See Exhibit 3.
* ***Put selling portfolio (put sale + long stock) is up 4.7% since Jan expiration.***  
We track this portfolio through the month to see how single stock put selling has performed. We estimate this portfolio is up 4.7% compared to the average stock performance of up 4.2%.

**We identify short-term overwriting opportunities (1 month) as well as longer-term overwriting opportunities (3-6 months) based on two primary methods-&gt;**

* ***Short-term overwrites (1 month): We focus on Events, Market Cap and implied volatility.***  
Our overwriting study shows that event timing and stock characteristics are particularly important factors for overwriting outperformance with short-term options. We identify stocks that do not report earnings prior to the next expiration where their market cap is in the top 2/3 of the universe and their implied volatility is also in the top 2/3. We have found that overwriting stocks with these characteristics has added over 500 bps over the past 16 years. See Exhibit 4.
* ***Longer-term overwrites (3-6 months): We focus on our analysts‚Äô fundamental views.***  
While short-term volatility may drive a stock from its appropriate longer-term value, we believe that over a sufficiently long period of time, the stock should trend toward that value. We use our analysts‚Äô price targets to identify those stocks where calls appear overpriced relative to our analysts‚Äô estimate of where shares are likely to trade. This methodology is consistent with our ‚ÄúBuy-write monthly.‚Äù See Exhibit 5 and Exhibit 6.
* ***Underwriting (6 months): Put-selling screen based on average support levels for EV/EBITDA, EV/SALES and P/FCF (6 months).***  
In this screen, we start with Buy-rated stocks from the Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research coverage universe. The put strike to sell is derived from the average of downsides to the stock price in three scenarios where each of EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales and P/FCF reaches its 10%-ile value in last 10 years and is based on our analysts‚Äô 12-month forward estimates for EBITDA, Sales, and FCF. See Exhibit 7.

Covered call sellers risk limiting upside to the strike price plus the option premium and dividends. Put sellers commit to buying shares at the strike price.

**Over the past 18 years, Buy-write strategies have outperformed the total return of the S&amp;P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis.**  
These strategies have become increasingly popular among investors, especially given the prospects of flat to negative equity markets. Options provide asymmetric exposure to the underlying asset, unlike stock or stock-like investments. This property helps provide a downside cushion to covered call sellers, in the form of a premium. This premium, especially when viewed in the context of a systematic strategy, is often viewed by investors as similar to interest or coupon payments, and leads to outperformance over stocks in flat to negative equity markets.

**Historical Performance of Systematic Overwriting strategies:**

1. We performed a detailed analysis of single stock overwriting over the past 18 years for S&amp;P 500 companies. We find that a large variety of systematic overwriting strategies have higher Sharpe ratios than stock only portfolios and select strategies have also had higher total returns.
2. We estimate that selling 10% out-of-the-money 1 month covered calls on stocks with liquid options in the S&amp;P 500 generated a compound annual return of 10.6% since 2003, **outperforming S&amp;P 500 Total Return by 0.6% annually.**
3. Most of the Buy-write strategies have outperformed the total return of S&amp;P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis, regardless of strike selection. The **Sharpe ratios across buy-write strategies ranged from 0.46 to 0.74, compared to 0.64 for the S&amp;P 500 Total Return Index over the same period.**

1. **Outperformance was the largest in the Consumer Staples (270bps) sector.**  
On an absolute basis, the strongest performance was in Information Technology where a Buy write (10% OTM calls) strategy led to an annualized return of 13.5% over the past 16 years.
2. Overwriting added 170bps annually to the performance of the underlying Financial stocks, **boosting the annualized return from 4.6% to 6.3%.**

***Earnings and the Effect on Overwriting Strategies:***  
To estimate the impact of earnings on overwriting, we subset our analysis to identify stocks which are reporting each month. We avoid selling calls on these stocks, instead capturing stock-only returns for those names in the particular month, driven by our view that earnings are generally positive events for stocks.

The below exhibit compares annual returns of the earnings-adjusted covered call selling strategy with the strategy that includes earnings. We also show the ratio of average earnings-day moves vs. non-earnings days each year.

***Conclusion: with earnings days becoming more volatile relative to non-earnings days, avoiding earnings when overwriting systematically has led to higher returns.***

* FTX, Gemini and Voyager bankruptcies have caused COIN to gain market share. 
* Regulation which is yet to take place could act as a massive tailwind for the company. 
* Coinbase is the most trusted crypto exchange for a reason, which will garner massive inflows from institutions upon proper regulation.

**Bullish Drivers:**

If you were an investor in Costco and you learned Walmart went out of business, would you logically view the destruction of competition as a positive for your investment? It is undeniable, the demise of FTX and other crypto exchanges are positively affecting Coinbase. Coinbase's share of the fiat exchange market has nearly doubled, up to 40% from 22.8% in September.

The Biden Administration released a note last week on Crypto Regulation ([Link](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/biden-administration-releases-roadmap-to-mitigate-cryptocurrency-risks)). The roadmap is focused on protecting investors and developing digital assets in a safe and responsible way. The focus on ‚Äúbad actors‚Äù will only differentiate Coinbase even more. Comprehensive regulation is exactly what institutions need to allocate capital to this emerging space. 

With the looming regulatory tailwind set to come to fruition in 2023 Coinbase is positioned to benefit more than any other stock or exchange. Coinbase is simply the most trusted crypto exchange in the world, they are publicly traded in the US which means they must adhere to the strictest audit standards in the world. They hold crypto assets 1:1 (unlike FTX) and are the premier exchange for large institutions. Regulation of crypto currencies will cause massive inflows from larger institutions and it will happen predominantly at Coinbase. The perception of safety is demonstrated by COIN‚Äôs ability to garner partnerships with Blackrock &amp; Google. The Blackrock partnership will allow the world‚Äôs largest asset management company to provide institutional clients with direct access to the COIN platform. COIN‚Äôs Google partnership will allow Google Cloud customers to pay for their services via select cryptocurrencies facilitated by Coinbase Commerce. 

**Outperformance relative to crypto:**

Although BTC outperformed Coinbase in 2022 since 2023 started Coinbase is up 76% compared to BTC.X which is up 43% (COIN Outperformed by 33%). I expect this outperformance to continue throughout the year as there is simply no alternative to a stock like COIN due to the fact there are no publicly traded peers (HOOD could be considered a peer, but not a pure play on the space like COIN). 

**Valuation:**

Coinbase, like many companies in 2023 is cutting back on labor costs. The company revealed its plan to cut 20% of its workforce in an effort to increase its ‚Äú*chances of doing well in every scenario*‚Äù. The job cuts demonstrate the company's efforts to move toward profitability and protect shareholder interests. Compared to technology companies that hold very little assets Coinbase‚Äôs P/B (FWD) ratio of 2.6X signifies safety as market cap is only 2.6x their value of assets. The company is sitting on $5B in cash and is investing heavily to grow the business which is shown with their +24% YOY CAPEX Growth. Coinbase like banks can make money off the assets that are held at the firm. Infact, in 2021 net interest income (lending out customer assets through safe short duration fixed income) was less than 10% of revenue for the company, now NII accounts for about 30% of their revenue. Also, revenue growth is expected to be around 30% over the next twelve months which is encouraging. 

**Risks and key takeaways:**

It's no secret trading volume has dropped significantly from the peaks in 2020. Although I see the risk of additional drops in volumes over the next couple years as low, it could happen if the crypto market doesn't get necessary regulation. Additionally, rising rates are a major headwind for the technology sector and the broader crypto space. As rates rise investors will consider alternatives to equities, cash flows of stocks have always been discounted at the ‚Äúrisk-free‚Äù interest rate which is widely considered the 10yr treasury yield. When this rate rises companies with less stable cash flows lose value traditionally. 

There are a significant number of money managers who are short the crypto space which is shown in COIN‚Äôs short interest which as a percent of float is 28%. I believe once we see regulation for the crypto space short positions will unwind and institutions should come into the stock. 

**Conclusion:**

I see Coinbase as a once in a lifetime investment opportunity. In the short term I believe the street high price target of $200 (Lisa Ellis of SVB MoffettNathanson) which is based on a 2X EBITDA for 2024 as a very fair target to place on the stock. Long term I believe coinbase could shock shareholders with Tesla like returns. Similar to Tesla, Coinbase is the first entrant into a highly sought after space, which brings risks with potential for enormous long term gains.",Coinbase Stock Is A Generational Wealth Opportunity,1675117230

Below is the latest in-depth and summary DD from High Tide (a leading retail-focused cannabis company with bricks-and-mortar as well as global e-commerce assets. The Company is the largest non-franchised cannabis retail chain in Canada, with 151 current locations spanning British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario) which I hope will be appreciated and shared.

What I find important to note is the following:

High Tide is valued at approximately 170 million each market cap with double-digit annual growth and quarterly reduced expenses, in an ultra-competitive market, a constant increase in gross margins and a turnover of over 400 million annually. The company trades at 0.5 times the sales‚Ä¶ These few lines, in addition to the in-depth and exhaustive dd, should make us reflect on the true value of the company and not on what the market values ‚Äã‚Äãit now.

Earnings are expected after markets close tomorrow, enjoy reading :)

SOURCE STORY Snapshot: CEO and Raj Grover started the company that became High Tide with $50,000 and a vision. With never more than $30 million in the bank, Raj strategically transformed one store into today's 151-store, multi-vertical, growth rate of over $400 million in '23.

When they were only 8mln 4 years ago!

Wisely borrowing pages directly from dominant retail companies' playbooks of: COST COST: Club Membership = Low Prices = Loyalty = Market Share

STARBUCKS SBUX: dollar is selling the coffee, not growing the beans

High Tide's strategy is unique and farsighted, given the number of companies currently competing with themselves and the market saturation which increasingly reduces margins, but this does not affect High Tide.

The Discount Club model is causing long lines out the door. Taking a page from major retailers in other industries, this allows customers to order online or at a kiosk and collect from a ""smart"" locker. For those customers who know what they want and don't need budtender guidance, this is a handy convenience. Very few dispensaries in the world have this experience. Also mentioned in the PR is a desire to license this technology to other dispensaries and industries which could turn into another revenue stream. Delivery will be made available to all locations permitted by law but this offers a fast, convenient and quick way to order/collect. It also cuts the dollars spent on budtenders by keeping the lines moving.

# Risk Parity Leverage Accelerating / Equity Vol Control Higher

Risk parity volatility is dropping at a fast pace and correspondingly leverage is rising, leading this class of funds to increase their equity, bond, and commodity allocations. Similarly, S&amp;P 500 realized vol declined meaningfully on the week which could lead to buying from equity vol control strategies early next week.

Good morning and happy Monday! I hope you all had an amazing weekend and are prepared for what is going to be an extremely interesting day for the markets! $SPY has come down significantly from the relative top but is still trading above $400 at the time of writing this report. Please be extremely careful treading in this water as the markets are looking extremely volatile and are looking to test major support soon. Keep capitalizing on the opportunities presented to you, but this is not the worst time to start taking profit on positions you lack confidence in and start hedging positions you attempt to retain. I expect a downside in the general markets, so tread lightly and do not get greedy.

Vix is slowly rising, so the opportunity to get puts is a little bit more expensive, but it is still a great time to open puts in the market to minimize general exposure. Look to realize some gains when given an opportunity to do so.

536,StockMarket," Good Morning Ainvestors!

.

Last night, the three major U.S. stock indexes closed higher. By the close, the Dow was up 0.08%, the Nasdaq was up 0.95% and the S&amp;P was up 0.25%.

.

On the weekly chart for SPY, last week was up 2.48% and moving towards the resistance around $410. The weekly chart is still on a mid-term downtrend. On the daily chart, the upper shadow looked ugly for the long side though SPY closed green last Friday. The intraday price correction should not be considered as a bearish signal. However, our Ainvest analysts still tend to long than short on SPY.

.

QQQ was up 4.80% last week and broke the resistance on the weekly chart. Currently it is extended to the upside on the daily chart. Correction should appear in the next few trading days and be aware of the RSI indicator, which is approaching to 70 level.

.

Ten-year Treasury yields rose 0.143% to 3.507%, with a gap of -70 basis points over two-year yields. The VIX was down 1.17%, Brent crude closed down 1.41% and spot gold continued to rally, closed down 0.08% at $1,927.73 per ounce. UBS raised its gold price forecast, particularly by the end of 2023, with a target price of $2,100 an ounce (compared with $1,850 previously). The dollar index continued to retreat from its highs to close at 101.92.

**Trending Stocks**

[**Intel(INTC)**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-INTC/)

Intel fell 6.41% as revenue fell 32% year-over-year in 22Q4, the lowest quarterly revenue since 2016, and posted a net loss of $700 million, which swung from profit to loss and missed expectations. Q1 revenue is expected to be in the range of $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, sharply below consensus of $14 billion

The intraday price correction with huge volume proved the market‚Äôs confidence of Intel. It will not be surprised if INTC fill its in the short-term. It is having a MACD Death Cross and last Friday‚Äôs high and low will be significant in then next few days.

.

[**Chevron(CVX)**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-CVX/)

Chevron fell 4.44% on better-than-expected 17% year-over-year revenue growth in 22Q4; Net income rose to $6.353 billion from $5.055 billion, or an adjusted profit of $4.09 a share, but both missed market expectations. Full-year net profit for 2022 was $35.465 billion making a new record, and the company announced buybacks would remain at $5 billion to $15 billion annually.

Although CVX was down last Friday, it is backed into the equilibrium area. Therefore, this could be considered as a price correction that happened on earnings, since CVX was over extended on the upside last Thursday.

**Opportunities**

For those that do not know as of late I am dealing with a family matter, health issue with my sister, that has my attention. So for the duration until this matter is solved, things will be a bit of touch and go with the DD and TA and Content on my end coming into this month. Not to say I will not be here nor trading which I will but it will be off and on or sporadic at best. Bear with me, Family first.

Alright, Alright, Alright to start, were coming into the biggest earnings week yet. We have $GOOGL, $AMZN, $META, $AAPL and $AMD all report this week along side the economic data. We also have #Fed, #PMI and #NFP this week. Starting out he week, Monday is a dead day.

\-Tuesday though is a banger with:

\*9am S&amp;P/case-schiller home price index

\*9:45 Chicago PMI

\*10am Consumer confidence

In the morning $CAT reports and is expected to beat

In the afternoon $AMD reports and is expected to beat

\-Wednesday is the biggest day of the week, mid day 2pm, #Fed decision and remarks from #Powell. A 25bps is expected (Refer to chart Fed watch-tool) This will be the biggest action in the market by far this week. This may also determine that we are one or two meetings away from peak rate and if this is the case then we are looking at again (March-June) timeframe for peak and reasonable to assume the fed will cut sometime after September. We will have to see if it will be this yr still and or they will hold rates and will cut in 2024.

Wednesdays data:

\*9:45am S&amp;P Global Manufacturing PMI Final

\*ISM Manufacturing PMI/Jolts Job

\*10:30p am ELA Inventory's

Wednesdays earnings:

$META after hrs. and its expected to miss

\-Thursdays is a bit lighter on Econ data but more so with Earnings.

Thursdays data:

\*8:30am Non-Farm Payroll Q4

\*Initial Jobless Clams

Thursdays earnings:

\*Bunch of earnings coming out so check the calendar on what ones specific to you. the biggest to not of the day will be $GOOGL, $AAPL, $F, and $AMZN. Out of all of them Looking at $AAPL as they have a buy rating on them but ya know, Follow the Waves.

\-As for Friday the data:

\*8:30am NFP for Jan

\*9:45am S&amp;P Non-Manufacturing PMI for Jan

\*10am ISM Manufacturing PMI for Jan

That's about it for that crap. As far as charts outside of following along on proper channels, all I got for levels or should I say speaking on the /ES1 open, range is $4050-$4100. Overall for short to mid term you can expect a wider range, from the upside to $4183 to the down of $3976 give or take. I am not saying either of the levels will be hit, I am saying this is the overall rage of what to expect above below $4050-$4100. Watch for follow through or rejection of Fib levels and as always follow the waves.

\-Ill lay out the rest of the levels and chart as I stream tonight and will be posted on the according platforms. Follow there if you like. Will be going over $SPY, $AAPL, $TSLA, $GME, $BBBY $XOM and more. If your in the community, disregard this as you will get it immediately,

\-Keys for the week or Wednesday I should say

\*One of three things can potentially happen this week.  
1.Powell steps up hawkish language and comes down hard to tighten financial conditions ( chart)

2. Powell comes in hawkish but he cannot do crap about it. He cannot get more hawkish and the market its it is has been calling his bluff. (pic)

3. Powell acknowledges things have gotten much better and that odds of a soft landing have dramatically increased. Essentially approves of the rallying market and we end the year at all time highs. JKJK

That's it for me. Follow along if you will and or forge your own path and create your tomorrows through your actions and habits you set today. As always, Chest to the Sun and Positive Vibes, KEEP THROWING THE STONE!!

 Also explained in our Youtube video:

2. When can CyberTruck reach its massive production?

576,StockMarket," Wizards,

Not often can we witness sea changes in real time. As a pendulum swing reaches its apex, stalls, and reverses, we are not the least bit surprised (unless you're a Goblin). When economic and market pressures depress equity values, negative psychosocial forces ensure they stay depressed as a safety measure! Negative sentiment is a collective ""circling of the wagons"" during uncertain times. We act as a unit to protect the value of our assets, and minimize damage to our portfolios.

As financial conditions stabilize, market psychology does not immediately reflect the changing fundamental picture. Negative market sentiment keeps prices honest!

Let others run this defense for you, and take advantage of their noble service.

In my view, continuing to hold a negative outlook on the equity market for the remainder of 2023 is unfavorable. The sellers have sold, and there is ample dry powder on the sidelines to rationalize higher P/Es as investors flock back to equities. As P/Es expand, the excuse will be these are leading 2024 earnings and beyond; not simply justifying shrinking 2023 earnings!

Why are equities more attractive than fixed income right now? Two reasons. First, the average retail investor doesn't follow bonds, they follow stocks. New investors have had time to digest fixed income options, and most of them have chosen not to participate (it's just simply harder to do). Second, market efficiency has priced in the range of outcomes already anticipated by us all (including the Fed). In light of number two, the equity market has NOT fallen further.

Au contraire, risk-on indicators like $TSLA and $BTC are running. $TSLA bottomed at $109, and is up to $177 in two weeks time. This, and noble market breadth and resilience from large cap tech, bodes well for the averages.

There are a range of probable outcomes here forward‚Äî in my view, anticipating bullish outcomes in 2023 are to be the most profitable.",The bottom of 2023 has been put in.,1675032077

&amp;#x200B;

**1. OPERATING LEVERAGE**

Shopify announced price hikes across the board for merchants using its platform - the first in 12 years. The changes are as follows for each plan:

* Basic Plan: $29 &gt; $39
* Shopify Plan: $79 &gt; $105
* Advanced Plan: $299 &gt; $399

Great example here of operating leverage - because if SHOP can retain customers with these significant price hikes, their margins (and thus profits) will soar.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. EARNINGS DATE ANNOUNCED**

Shopify announced a date for their Q4 2022 earnings.

All eyes will be on the stock on Wednesday, February 15 after market close for results from Shopify.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. CTO DEPARTURE**

The CTO of Shopify (Allan Leinwand) has decided to leave the company due to personal reasons.

Allan was the CTO for 15 months. His departure comes as a surprise to the company and no replacement CTO is planned right now (the CEO will take responsibilities for now).

&amp;#x200B;

**4. EXECUTIVE LAYOFFS**

News broke that Shopify laid off their VP of Infrastructure (Mike Lents) and VP of Engineering (Ravi Byakod) earlier this month.

Shopify is going through some serious re-org to optimize cost, and this could be impacting employee morale - keep an eye out here.

&amp;#x200B;

605,StockMarket,"**OVERALL:**  QQQ has 'caught up to' IWM, while SPY is now the infex lagging behind.  Markets will likely be quiet heading into Wednesday afternoon's Fed decision, which most analysts believe will be a 0.25 hike.  I have to maintain a neutral-to-positive bias considering how 2 out of 3 indexes re-tested their beear channel ceilings and those levels held, but I would not be surprised to see price move back into the bear channel in the weeks following the Fed meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY:**  Compared to QQQ and IWM, this index is actually lagging from a technical perspective.  It took the longest to break out of the bear channel (and just barely did not with Friday's close), it has yet to reach the last pivot high, and has has yet to re-test the bear channel ceiling.  Therefore, price remains 'stuck' between these 2x major resistance and suport levels: 410 and 398 respectively.  The facts that it 'gapped out' of the bear channel, and both QQQ+IWM have reached major pivot high support, leads me to think price will hit 410 before the Fed on Wednesday.  But the way it gave up in the final hour of trading on Friday...maybe just people taking profits into the weekend, or maybe indicating it will not reach that pivot high.

**QQQ:**  This week I'd say tech finally 'caught up' to IWM from a techincal perspective, considering it both 1) broke out of the bear channel (which IWM did a couple weeks ago) and 2) reached the last pivot high (which IWM did at the same time this week as well).  That said &amp; of note, IWM has pulled back to re-test its bear channel ceiling (now a major support level), whereas the QQQ has not, so this is the nearest major support around 284.  Price is currently into a major resistance level, but if it can get through then next resistance is just over 311 which is the next pivot high and also a pretty big gap fill between September 12-13.

**IWM:**  Great price action from a technical perspective.  After officially breaking out of the bear channel, price went back to what turned into a major support level (as a result of the breakout), and then rallied to the next major resistance level -- which we hammered on the last 2x days.  The next major resistance level is around 196, which is a very long term ascending channel ceiling the pre-dates all the madness we've seen since COVID stimulus.  The nearest major support level remains around 181, the bear channel ceiling and now also the 200 DMA as well as the TL which lead to the failed bear flag pattern.

* Since the FOMC last met in December, incoming data on wage growth &amp; inflation have been encouraging, while signals on activity growth have been mixed &amp; sometimes concerning. This ended up making the case for slowing the pace of hikes to 25bps. Key question for February meeting is what the FOMC will signal about further hikes this year...
* FOMC's goal this year is clear-&gt; It aims to continue in 2023 what it began in 2022 by staying on a below-potential growth path in order to rebalance the labor market so that inflation can return sustainably to 2%.
   * Goldman \*agrees\* with Fed officials that there is still a long way to go (the jobs-workers gap is still about 3mm above pre-pandemic levels)
* How many hikes needed to stay on this path is less clear -&gt; ***GS expects 25bps each in March &amp; May***
   * *Fewer may be needed if weak business confidence depresses hiring &amp; investment*
   * *More may be needed if economy reaccelerates as the impact of past tightening fades*
* ***Fed officials appear to expect \*two more hikes\* &amp; will likely tone down the reference to ""ongoing"" hikes being appropriate in the FOMC statement***

**Since FOMC last met in December, two trends in the economic data have strengthened the case for slowing to 25bps next Wednesday -&gt;**

1. **Encouraging data on wage growth &amp; inflation***-&gt; Deceleration in average hourly earnings &amp; Atlanta Fed wage growth tracker-&gt; Another round of soft inflation data...--&gt; Continued collapse in alternative leading indicators of rent inflation--&gt; Decline in 1yr UMICH consumer inflation expectations (now 1.5% lower than start of hikes)*
2. **Signals on activity growth have become \*more\* mixed &amp; sometimes concerning -&gt;***-&gt; Large gap now between GDP &amp; Goldman's \*Current Activity Indicator\*-&gt; Large gap between 'hard data' components of \*CAI\* &amp; 'soft data' components, like surveys, etc...\*\* GS take -&gt; nominal bias &amp; neg sentiment driven by recession fears is depressing survey data \*\*****\*\* Uncertainty about the near-term outlook has RISEN \*\****

**KEY QUESTION &gt;&gt; ""WHAT WILL FOMC SIGNAL ABOUT FURTHER HIKES THIS YR?""**

GS thinks Fed's path is best thought of in terms of a goal to be accomplished rather than a target level of the funds rate to be reached. This goal is to continue in 2023 what the FOMC began successfully in 2022 by keeping the economy on a below-potential growth path in order to ""steadily but gently"" rebalance the labor market, which should in turn create the conditions for inflation to settle sustainably at 2%. This goal was clear in the FOMC's December economic projections - which showed that the median participant forecasted (read... ""aimed to achieve"") the exact same slow rate of GDP growth in 2023 as in 2022...

There's a long way to go before Fed officials will have confidence that inflation will settle at 2% sustainably...

***Goldman's take &gt;&gt; ""Substantial further labor market rebalancing will be needed, as the jobs-workers gap is about 3m above its pre-pandemic level, making it necessary to stay on the slow growth path for a while longer""***

How many rate hikes will be needed to keep the economy on this ""below-potential"" growth path in 2023 is *less clear*. GS continues to expect a hike on Wednesday (Feb 1) &amp; two additional 25bp hikes in March &amp; May, raising the target FF rate to a peak of 5-5.25%.

***BUT... IT'S EASY TO IMAGINE SCENARIOS WHERE THE FOMC DOES EITHER LESS OR MORE...***

Fewer hikes might be needed if recent weakening in business confidence captured by the survey data depresses hiring &amp; investment more than projected, substituting for additional rate hikes.However, *more hikes* might be needed if the economy reaccelerates as the drag on growth from past fiscal &amp; monetary policy tightening fades.The FOMC might need to recalibrate as we learn more about the growth pace &amp; could end up in a stop-&amp;-go pattern at some point later this year.

***FINAL TAKEAWAYS?***

* *The December dots indicated that the median FOMC participant also expects two additional 25bps hikes \*AFTER\* the Feb 1 hike...*
* *GS expects the FOMC will \*TONE DOWN\* the reference to ""ongoing"" hikes being appropriate in the FOMC statement (i.e., replacing ""ongoing"" with ""further"")*

&amp;#x200B;

Amazon (AMZN) investors closed off the week with the stock gaining¬†**+4.65%** the last 5 days, which means it sits at¬†**+19.13%**¬†YTD. Here's the news (there's a lot):

&amp;#x200B;

**1. LET'S FLY**

Amazon Air is now being used in India - this will help with delivery times as planes are dedicated for package transit.

  
**2. CLOUDS DOWN UNDER**

 AWS has announced a second location in Australia for customers to host their data.

This will help with higher reliability and resiliency, security, and lower latency (things load quicker!). The new location is expected to create 2,500+ new jobs and will cost about $4.5B worth of investment as the project runs through 2037.¬†

  
**3. GRAB YOUR POPCORN**

Amazon's new movie, Air, will be released in theatres (I guess movie chains aren't dead?).

This movie is centered around Air Jordan, a wildly successful brand, and how it was created and became the monster it is today.

  
**4. MORE STRIPE**

 Amazon is expanding it's partnership with Stripe to power some of it's services (like Buy With Prime, Audible, etc.). 

In exchange, Stripe plans to expand use of AWS, so this is where Amazon will benefit from this partnership.

  
**5. YOU'RE DISMISSED**

Amazon faced a lawsuit who former Whole Foods employees on getting fired illegally, but a Judge dismissed this claim. Judge ruled employees were treated fairly and same treatment was applied to all employees.

  
**6. RXPASS**

Amazon has announced a new monthly subscription for prescription medication.

The new service, called RxPass, is a $5/month subscription for Prime members (look out GoodRx Gold). The HUGE announcement though is this is one flat fee per month to get all the eligible medication you need!

  
**7. NEW NEIGHBORS**

Amazon has bought nearly 400 acres of land in Ohio for $116.65M - and this lot is near Intel's new 1000 acre lot!

  
**8. UK STRIKE**

An Amazon warehouse in England is likely to see its workers go on a 24 hour strike this week.¬†

This will be the first strike in Britain, and is largely around salary. There could be about 300 employees participating. The current salary is ¬£10.50-¬£11.45, but workers want to see this increased to ¬£15.

  
**9. TRIM THE FAT**

Amazon is looking to sell a California office that it bought in 2021 for $123 Million.

  
**10. NEW GROCERY FEES** 

Amazon will start charging Prime members a delivery fee on groceries for orders under $150 on February 28. The fee breakdown is as follows for orders under $150:

* $3.95 for orders between $100-$150
* $6.95 for orders between $50-$100
* $9.95 for orders under $50

New revenue stream for Amazon!

632,StockMarket,"To generalize, let's say I own 100 shares of a company and they report earnings next week and I'm worried about the price dipping 5-10% after the earnings call. As I see it, there's a couple options I have:

1. Sell my shares. Which I don't want to do, they're in the red right now but I'm confident in the company.

2. Short 50 or 100 shares which should reduce my exposure to the market by 50% or 100% respectively. This should essentially negate my position until I close my short position. Am I missing anything here?

3. Buy some PUTs at the money or deep out of the money to offset losses. This could just be throwing money away if the stock goes up.

4. Wait and buy more if the stock dips. My position is already relatively significant, so doubling or tripling my position isn't really feasible. The amount I could buy wouldn't drastically lower my cost per share.

He's looking at average p/e and telling me he's extremely concerned the market is wildly overvalued and an S&amp;P of 3200 isn't unreasonable. Mixed with continued rate hikes. More than what the market is assuming, he thinks this isn't going to be a ""soft-landing""

Wondering what yalls thoughts on this are. He mentioned that in the 80s, there was an inflation spike, the fed cranked up rates, inflation started to ease, then they lowered which caused a rebound in inflation and the FED isn't going to let that happen again.

## Advantages of Technology Stocks

**Investing in Innovation**: Investing in technology stocks allows investors to back revolutionary ideas that have the potential to improve people‚Äôs lives. Technology companies of all sizes continually push boundaries to be first to market with game-changing technology, whether it be Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a new health feature for its iWatch or a startup developing a game-changing semiconductor for the automotive industry.¬†¬†

**Growth Potential:** Technology stocks offer the potential for sizable gains, with investors usually prepared to pay a premium for future growth. For instance, as of January 2023, the technology sector traded at 20.5 times forward earnings. By comparison, the energy and financial sectors had forward price-to-earnings ratios (forward P/Es) of 8.1 and 12.9, respectively.31 Although the biggest gains can be found in small-cap technology stocks, even mega-cap tech titans such as the original FANG members‚ÄîMeta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Netflix Inc. (NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)‚Äîhad an annualized return of 20.9% over the past decade as of Jan. 23, 2023.32

**AT&amp;T**

* **\*Year-To-Date Performance: +8.6%**
* **\*Market Cap: $142.1 Billion**

AT&amp;T is the world's largest telecommunications company and the leading provider of mobile telephone services in the U.S.

Shares have run hot in recent weeks, with T stock marking a gain of almost 38% since slumping to a mid-October 52-week low of $14.46, a level last seen in March 2003.

The stock, which has surged 8.6% through the first four weeks of the new year, ended Thursday‚Äôs session at $20, earning it a valuation of $142.1 billion. Shares held up much better than the broader market in 2022, falling less than 1% last year, demonstrating the strength and resilience of its business.

Despite cutting its dividend payout following the overhaul of its media and telecommunications portfolio, AT&amp;T is still one of the 15 highest-yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500.

The wireless phone carrier currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.2775 per share, which implies an annualized payout of $1.11 per share at a yield of 5.44%, more than triple the implied yield for the S&amp;P 500, which is 1.56%.

Unsurprisingly, the quantitative models in *InvestingPro* point to a gain of 7.6% in AT&amp;T‚Äôs stock, bringing shares closer to their fair value of $21.51.

# **Stocks close higher Friday, Nasdaq posts fourth week of gains - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/26/stock-futures-tick-down-after-the-dow-posts-a-five-day-win-streak.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks rose Friday and capped off a winning week fueled by better-than-expected economic growth and a pop in Tesla shares.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.95% to settle at 11,621.71, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.25% to close at 4,070.56. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 28.67 points, or 0.08%, to finish at 33,978.08.
*****
&gt; All the major averages posted a positive week and are on pace for a month of gains. The tech-heavy index rose 4.32% and closed out its fourth week of gains. It‚Äôs on pace for its best monthly performance since July. The S&amp;P and Dow added 2.47% and 1.81%, respectively, this week.
*****
&gt; Earnings season pressed on, with strong guidance boosting American Express shares by 10.5% despite a top-and bottom-line miss. Some chip stocks rose even as Intel slumped more than 6% on a dismal earnings report that missed expectations.
*****
&gt; Tesla rose 11% Friday, and more than 33% for the week after reporting record revenue. It marked the electric vehicle stock‚Äôs best weekly performance since May 2013.
*****
&gt; So far this year, markets have bucked 2022‚Ä≤s selloff trend. The Dow is up 2.5%, while the S&amp;P has gained 6%. The Nasdaq has surged 11%.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre putting the final touches on an extremely strong January on the heels of lower inflation, and an economy that‚Äôs hanging in there,‚Äù said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not out of the woods though. We‚Äôve still got the Fed next week, and they might want to throw some water on this rally.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Investors weighed more economic data Friday ahead of next week‚Äôs Federal Reserve policy meeting. The personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding energy and food, showed prices rose 4.4% from a year ago, the Commerce Department said, and in line with the Dow Jones estimate. So-called PCE is a preferred inflation gauge for the Fed.
*****
&gt; A better-than-expected fourth-quarter gross domestic product report Thursday also helped stoke hopes that the Fed may manage a soft landing.
*****
&gt; These are some of the last data points before the central bank‚Äôs widely expected 25 basis point hike.

&gt; # February Better In Pre-Election Years

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c4eff32afed2c42603d8164cc899a4ae/3bfc0b06e3404977-44/s500x750/9bac22e482016defabc13bb218e026a0adc0ad57.jpg))**

&gt; Normally the ‚Äúweak link‚Äù of the Best Months, February has been stronger in pre-election years, #5 for DJIA and NASDAQ; #6 for S&amp;P 500 and #4 for Russell 2000. Average gains range from 1.2% by S&amp;P 500 to 2.8% from NASDAQ. Benefitting from January Effect spillover, Russell 2000 averages 2.7% in pre-election Februarys.

&gt; The first trading day of February is bullish for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000. Average gains on the first day over the most recent 21-year period range from 0.39% by DJIA to 0.65% by Russell 2000. However, after a strong opening day, strength has tended to fade until around the fourth trading day. From there until around the 12-trading day all five indexes have historically enjoyed gains. But those gains have not held through the end of February.

&gt; Pre-election-year Februarys going back to 1950 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500, 1971 for NASDAQ and 1979 for Russell 1000 &amp; 2000, exhibit a similar pattern, but the gains have held through the end of the month.

***** 

&gt; # February 2023 Almanac: Historically Solid Gains in Pre-Election Years

&gt; Although February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from ‚ÄúJanuary Effect‚Äù carry over; historically tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.1% in February since 1979‚Äîjust the sixth best month for that benchmark. Even with the market struggling the past two trading sessions Russell 2000 has maintained a performance lead this January compared to DJIA and S&amp;P 500. This does bode well for the continued outperformance in February by small-cap stocks.

&gt; In pre-election years, February‚Äôs performance generally improves with average returns all turning positive. NASDAQ performs best, gaining an average 2.8% in pre-election-year Februarys since 1971. Russell 2000 is second best, averaging gains of 2.7% since 1979. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000, the large-cap indices, tend to lag with average advances ranging from 1.2% to 1.7%.

&gt; # 5 Things To Know About Recessions And Bear Markets

&gt; ‚ÄúI am an optimist because I don‚Äôt see the point in being anything else.‚Äù Abraham Lincoln

&gt; With all the talk about a pending recession and stocks in a bear market, today, I wanted to share some more thoughts and stats on recessions and bear markets.

&gt; First things first, we do not currently anticipate a recession in 2023, which is quite opposite of the general consensus. You can read more about that here and here.

&gt; What exactly is a bear market? For the definition of a bear market, we are using the traditional definition, which is an index down 20% or more from the recent peak. Yes, there isn‚Äôt much difference between 19.8% and 20.0%, so we will also include some near bear markets as well, but when we say bear market, that is what we mean.

&gt; First, do all bear markets take place in a recession? Turns out they don‚Äôt, as stocks, indeed can have a bear market without a recession. The worst ever was the 34% bear during the Crash of 1987, which all took place without a recession.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-197-800x595.png))**

&gt; Second, taking things a step further, here we broke down the performance based on if the bear market took place in a recession or not. Take note; we did include some ‚Äònear bear markets‚Äô this time to get more instances. Plus, a near bear feels like a bear market if you are in it. What still amazes us about the table below is that the average bear market without a recession was 24%, and this recent bear was 25%. Assuming we avoid a recession and October was indeed low, this was right on the bullseye.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-264-800x361.png))**

&gt; Now take another look at the table above. The last few bear markets recovered quite quickly. In fact, the last three bear markets that didn‚Äôt have a recession recovered in four, four, and three months. Something to think about here, as stocks are two months off the October lows.

&gt; Third, this has been making the rounds lately and has been adding to some of the worries. Looking at all the bear markets that took place around a recession, not once did the bear market end before the recession started. In other words, if we are indeed headed for a recession in 2023, this could suggest that new lows may also be quite likely. Incredibly, bears don‚Äôt end for another nine months on average after the recession started, before they find their ultimate low. Again, we don‚Äôt see a recession, so this wouldn‚Äôt be the case now, but the data is quite compelling.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BearMarketEnds-800x332.png))**

&gt; Fourth, the month of October tends to be a bear-market killer. Most bears have met their end during the month of October, more than any other month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/OctoberEnds-800x338.png))**

&gt; Below, we break down those previous 17 bear (or near bear) markets. The bottom line six of them ended in October, and we think there‚Äôs a very good chance number seven just happened.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-632-800x455.png))**

&gt; Fifth and lastly, if October was indeed the bear market low, be open to the idea of higher prices over the coming two years. While not a predictor of future behavior, history shows the markets were up more than 40% a year off of the bear-market lows and up almost 60% two years off of them. During uncertain and volatile situations (like the ones that markets have treated us to in 2022), it can be hard to imagine a positive path forward, and all we see are the obstacles. Stepping back a bit can be a helpful reminder of the resiliency of the markets over the long term.

&gt; Dr. Seuss said, ‚ÄúSometimes the questions are complicated, and the answers are simple.‚Äù To me, bear markets can be confusing and complicated, but the answer has always been that they indeed do eventually end, and historically better times will come when they do.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10lyors/schwab_to_start_charging_index_options_fees_next/)

Right now I only have to pay 35 cents per options contract, since my annual fees are well over 10K on options fees alone.  
I also like to do a lot of 0DTE SPX plays.

Given this new fee structure, each 0DTE SPX contract will cost me .35 + .52 = .87  
That's 87 cents per contract ONE WAY.

I've had days where I've traded more than 1,000 SPXW contracts one way.  
If I were to do the same on Feb 13th, I'd have paid 1,740 just in fees for a round trip (yes I know it's cash settled and I could just let them expire EOD; but I trade in and out within seconds).

If there's anything that can cure a degenerate gambler, it's being ripped off by a service provider.  
I had one crooked bookie give me a bullshit line on the NLF playoffs (not many I know will take my big bets).

That behenchod's line was so bad, I didn't even bet that weekend and turned me off to sports betting again.

With this new fee structure, I've lost compulsive degenerate WSB spirit for indexed options.  
I will not be playing anymore for this reason.

Only standard options and penny stocks to get my fix.

740,StockMarket,"Largo Inc. (TSX: LGO) (NASDAQ: LGO) announced annual production of 10,436 tonnes (23.0 million lbs.) of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) equivalent and sales of 11,091 tonnes of V2O5 equivalent from its Marac√°s Menchen Mine in 2022.  

Fourth quarter production was impacted by historic rainfall, but importantly Largo expects a strong rebound in both production and sales through 2023. A rebound in production and sales coupled with strengthening vanadium prices point to an exciting 2023 for the company.

&amp;#x200B;

**Key Developments:**

* Largo expects a 10% increase in production in 2023 over 2022, with production rising almost 60% from the 1st to the 4th quarter this year.
* Like a majority of operating companies globally, production costs continue to experience increasing inflationary pressures in 2023. Following higher estimated operating costs in H1 2023 due to the impacts from lower sales and production, costs are expected to end the year around the lower end of its reported guidance of $4.85 / lb V2O5.
* Final testing of Largo‚Äôs first VRFB battery installation is expected by the end of 2Q 2023, an important milestone for its clean energy business.
* Largo added liquidity by borrowing $45 million to support heightened growth capital spending in the first half of 2023.
* Vanadium prices hit $9.44/lb to end 2022, up 20% from the yearly low and still rising in January.

**Q4, FY 2022 and Other Highlights**

**Quarterly Operational Results Impacted by a Mining Contractor Change, Mine Sequencing and Heavy Rainfall:**

In Q4 2022, V2O5 production from the Marac√°s Menchen Mine of 2,004 tonnes was in line with the 2,003 tonnes produced in Q4 2021. As a result of the Largo‚Äôs mining contractor transition and corrective maintenance at the leaching and deammoniator areas, 804 tonnes of V2O5 were produced in October 2022. Production of 605 tonnes in November 2022 was affected by changes in mining sequence and 596 tonnes in December 2022 was affected by heavy rains at the Company‚Äôs operations.

Annual V2O5 production was 10,436 tonnes in 2022, being largely in line with the 10,319 tonnes produced in 2021. Lower annual production was due to preventative and corrective maintenance at Company‚Äôs plant facility in Marac√°s in Q1 2022, a planned kiln and cooler refractory refurbishment in Q3 2022 and heavy rainfall in December.

https://preview.redd.it/b3502pcixlea1.png?width=695&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e7dd8188ceba599962dfe763903c5b35e816e006

**Rainfall Impact and Mitigation Efforts ‚Äì Impacts to January 2023 Production and Sales Expected:**

There is a silver Lining to all the rain for Largo. They completed planned February maintenance in December/January during the rain induced downtime. This resulted in approximately 16 days of operational downtime in December 2022 and January 2023, during which time the Company performed preventative maintenance measure such as kiln refractory and electrostatic precipitator (‚ÄúESP‚Äù) repairs, previously planned for February 2023.

As a result of these rain-related impacts in December 2022 and January 2023, the Company expects Q1 2023 production and sales ranges of 1,900 ‚Äì 2,200 tonnes and 2,300 ‚Äì 2,500 tonnes, respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

**Annual Sales Results Within Guidance ‚Äì Vanadium Prices Reflect Increase in Demand:**

In Q4 2022, V2O5 equivalent sales were 2,774 tonnes (inclusive of 118 tonnes of purchased material), representing a 4% decrease over Q4 2021. Total V2O5 equivalent sales were 11,091 tonnes (inclusive of 1,057 tonnes of purchased material) in 2022, representing a 3% decrease over 2021. Lower sales in Q4 were impacted by the effects of lower production. Stronger vanadium prices exiting the quarter reflected an increase in demand from the high purity aerospace sector and continued growth in VRFB deployments, particularly in China.

The average benchmark price per lb of V2O5 in Europe was $9.44 exiting the quarter, representing an increase of approximately 20% from the lows of 2022. As of January 20, 2023, the benchmark price per lb of V2O5 in Europe was $10.08.

&amp;#x200B;

**Inaugural VRFB Deployment Progress:**

During Q4 2022, LCE continued to make additional progress on the delivery of the Enel Green Power Espa√±a (‚ÄúEGPE‚Äù) contract. Substantially all of the hardware is either in transit or ready for installation at the deployment site in Spain. The remaining items to be shipped are six of the twelve electrolyte storage containers, which will be shipped in February 2023 and installed in March 2023. Additionally, the Company expects the installation and interconnection of the AC and DC power systems to be completed in Q1 2023. The hot commissioning of the VRFB system as well as provisional acceptance, which requires the completion of as-build drawings, manuals, final punch-list items, and operational testing by EGPE is expected to be completed in Q2 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

**New Debt Facilities Secured in Brazil:**

In December 2022, the Company secured an additional debt facility of $20.0 million with a bank in Brazil. The facility is for three years, with a 360-day grace period and equal principal repayments due every six months until maturity following the grace period. In addition to a fee of 0.7%, accrued interest at a rate of 8.20% p.a. is to be paid every six months until maturity. In January 2023, the Company secured two additional debt facilities with banks in Brazil. The first facility of $15.0 million is for two years, with a 180-day grace period and equal principal repayments due every three months until maturity following the grace period. 

In addition, accrued interest at a rate of 6.85% p.a. is to be paid every three months. The second facility of $10.0 million is for three years, with a 360-day grace period and equal principal repayments due every six months until maturity following the grace period. In addition to a fee of 0.7%, accrued interest at a rate of 8.36% p.a. is to be paid every six months. A portion of the December 2022 debt facility was used in December 2022 to repay the Company‚Äôs existing $15.0 million debt facility secured in April 2022 and due for repayment in April 2023, with the remaining debt facilities primarily being used to address working capital pressures caused by ongoing capex projects in the first six months of 2023.",Largo Reports Q4 &amp; Full Year 2022 Production Results &amp; Provides 2023 Guidance,1674834797

748,StockMarket,"Good morning and Happy Friday! I hope you all have had a phenomenal week and are excited about the significant amount of volatility and momentum in the markets. There will be many opportunities to trade today, but please be extremely careful when actively allocating, as we are at an indecisive point in the markets that will result in both chop and general market fakeouts. I am expecting many traders today to get impacted by this chop as well as will emotionally trade in an attempt to make up losses.

Two recommendations I would have today are looking into selling 0-DTE CSPs on organizations you like and looking into purchasing puts as a hedge on your portfolio.  You will not be able to collect too much premium from those 0-DTEs, but money is money. At the same time, Vix is extremely low at the moment, so purchasing puts as a hedge will be exponentially cheaper. I am excited about a massive vix expansion in the near future, so just be on the lookout!

751,StockMarket,,Can Intel Still Be Considered a Value Stock?,1674826265
752,StockMarket,"Intel Corp said on Thursday it expects to lose money in the current quarter, surprising investors with a bleaker-than-expected outlook for both the PC market and slowing growth in its key data center division.

The company's shares fell 9.5% in trading after the bell.

""We stumbled, right, we lost share, we lost momentum. We think that stabilizes this year,"" Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told investors on a conference call. He said Intel has been losing market share in the data center market, a nod at the strength of rival Advanced Micro Devices.

Two of Intel's most important markets are showing weakness after two years of strong growth as remote work boomed during the pandemic. Now, the PC industry is struggling with a glut of chips after demand for consumer electronics fell off a cliff and business customers wary of a recession are slowing spending on data centers.

Gelsinger told Reuters that customers also were emptying inventory.

""We expect some of the largest inventory corrections literally that we've ever seen in the industry taking place that's affecting the Q1 guide in a meaningful way,"" he said.

""Everything hinges on the PC market recovery. AMD isn‚Äôt immune to this either,"" said Wayne Lam, an analyst at CCS Insight. ""Don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve seen the bottom for INTC...They are not running a sustainable business model.""

Intel expects profit margins to fall further after dropping from 58.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 43.8% in the fourth quarter of 2022. ""Its safe to say that ambitions to return to a 60% margin in the future is light years away,"" said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.

Intel reiterated its medium-term goal of 51-53% gross margin, and 54-58% longer term.

Shares of other microchip companies fell as well, with AMD down 2.6% and Nvidia Corp down 2%.

PC shipments fell 16.5% to 292.3 million units in 2022, per data from research firm IDC, forcing chipmakers to cut back production and slash revenue forecasts.

Shrinking PC demand also **pressured** Microsoft Corp's More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows, devices and search revenue, leading to a 19% drop in the segment in its second quarter.

Meanwhile, the data center market has also slowed from double-digit growth as businesses cut costs to ride out an economic slowdown.

After Gelsinger returned to the company nearly two years ago, Intel has focused on regaining the lead in chipmaking technology. Outsourcing the chipmaking process has helped rivals like AMD make much smaller and faster chips and outpace Intel's technology.

The company forecast first-quarter revenue in the range of about $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. Analysts on average were expecting total revenue of $13.93 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

The company expects an adjusted loss of 15 cents per share versus expectations of a 24 cents per share profit.

Revenue in the fourth quarter fell 32% to $14 billion. Analysts on average expected revenue of $14.46 billion.

#[S&amp;P 500 futures trade slightly lower, but the index is headed for a winning week](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/26/stock-futures-tick-down-after-the-dow-posts-a-five-day-win-streak.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell slightly on Friday morning as investors looked to close out a winning week for markets that saw better-than-expected economic growth and a pop in market-darling Tesla.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures shed 0.28%, while Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded flat.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continued, with Intel slumped more than 9% premarket following a dismal earnings report that missed on the top and bottom lines. Strong guidance boosted American Express despite a top-and bottom-line miss.
*****
&gt; Stocks rose during regular trading Thursday, cheering a better-than-expected fourth quarter gross domestic product report that stoked hopes that the U.S. economy can experience a soft landing as the Federal Reserve hikes rates to tame inflation.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 205 points, or 0.61%, notching its fifth consecutive winning session, the first streak of that length since October. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.10% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.76%.
*****
&gt; All three indexes are positive for the week and month. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 have gained 1.7% and 2.2% this week, respectively. The Nasdaq is up 3.3% on the week and is set to notch its best monthly performance since July. The Nasdaq has gained the last four weeks.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThis year‚Äôs stock market rally is impressive and shouldn‚Äôt be ignored,‚Äù Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for the Independent Advisor Alliancesaid in a Thursday note. ‚ÄùUnfortunately, the Fed is likely to start talking down the market again, as early as next week, so prepare for volatility again this year; we may be in the eye of the hurricane and not completely out of the woods yet.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Tesla closed out Thursday with an 11% gain after earnings and revenue for the last quarter topped expectations and CEO Elon Musk projected the carmaker could possibly produce 2 million cars this year. The widely followed stock was down 65% last year to lead a rout in the growth sector. The shares are up more than 30% this year.
*****
&gt; On Friday, investors will be watching for economic reports that will give more information about the state of inflation. Personal income and spending and pending home sales for December are due in the morning. The personal consumption expenditures price index, a preferred inflation measurement for the Federal Reserve, is also due. Consumer sentiment for January will also be released.
*****
&gt; It‚Äôs some of the last data that will be released ahead of the Fed‚Äôs next interest-rate decision on Feb. 1. Investors are currently expecting a 0.25 percentage point interest rate hike from the central bank.

Ray III finalized court filings on behalf of FTX‚Äôs bankruptcy proceedings. After the first few paragraphs delving into the experience and the behind the bankruptcy, the filing takes a sharp turn. I‚Äôll let the filing speak for itself \[2\]:

**On the state of the company and leaders of FTX**

&gt;Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here. From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.

**On the Human Resources procedures at FTX**

&gt;The FTX Group‚Ä¶ have been unable to prepare a complete list of¬†*who*¬†worked for the FTX Group ... Repeated attempts to locate certain presumed employees to confirm their status have been unsuccessful to date.

**On loans given to SBF and other FTX leaders**

&gt;Related Party Loans Receivable of $4.1 billion at Alameda Research (consolidated) consistent primarily of a loan ‚Ä¶ to Paper Bird Inc. of $2.3 billion and‚Ä¶ one to Mr. Bankman Fried, of $1 billion; one to Mr. Singh, of $543 million; and one to Ryan Salame, of $55 million

**On security practices, especially Alameda‚Äôs exemption from FTX‚Äôs liquidation preference**

&gt;Unacceptable management practices included the use of an unsecured group email account as the root user to access confidential private keys and critically sensitive data ‚Ä¶, the secret exemption of Alameda from certain¬†aspects of [FTX.com](http://ftx.com/)‚Äôs auto-liquidation protocol, and the absence of independent governance as between Alameda (owned 90% by Mr. Bankman-Fried and 10% by Mr. Wang) and the Dotcom Silo (in which third parties had invested).

**On the misuse of corporate funds**

&gt;‚Ä¶corporate funds of the FTX Group were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisors‚Ä¶ certain real estate was recorded in the personal name of these employees and advisors on the records of the Bahamas.

**On FTX communication**

&gt;Mr. Bankman-Fried often communicated by using applications that were set to auto-delete after a short period of time, and encouraged employees to do the same.

**On SBF‚Äôs recent behavior**

&gt;Mr. Bankman-Fried, currently in the Bahamas, continues to make erratic and misleading public statements. Mr. Bankman-Fried, whose connections and financial holdings in the Bahamas remain unclear to me, recently stated to a reporter on Twitter: ‚ÄúF\*\*\* regulators they make everything worse‚Äù and suggested the next step for him was to ‚Äúwin a jurisdictional battle vs. Delaware‚Äù.

In plain English: this was a shitshow. The core FTX and Alameda team had -

1. No idea who their employees were
2. Loaned themselves $4.1 billion dollars from Alameda‚Äôs balance sheet
3. Implemented a secret exemption for Alameda on FTX‚Äôs liquidation engine
4. Purchased homes with corporate funds

All of these things are very, very bad.

Each of these points would be enough to raise significant eyebrows.

777,StockMarket,"Last night it did a 1:30 reverse stock split. Meaning that if you were to buy only one share before the reverse split, your one share would end up becoming .03 shares ($.36). However, certain brokers (like Robinhood) will be rounding up fractional shares, essentially giving you the remaining .97 shares which you can turn around and sell for a $10.44 profit. Although a small profit, it can be scaled by buying one share per brokerage account allowing you to quickly multiply profits.

I just amassed a 9% return for this year and im happy with it. I also ended 2022 with a 4.18% gain in my Roth IRA. I exited my positions until further notice and am still beating the S&amp;P. When the market goes down significantly or if it starts to show the signs of it continuing to pick up, I‚Äôll buy back in. When exactly that is? I‚Äôm not sure nobody has a crystal ball I‚Äôm just confident in my research enough to believe this isn‚Äôt entirely a bad idea",Let‚Äôs talk about a bad investment idea because I am full of them and have still somehow managed to beat the market,1674781545

It hurts me writing this, since It was not my ""bet"" but next major pull back is probably a buy (unless black swan event or we break major resistance quickly).

4 majors reasons IMO:

* Technical 
* Sentiment
* Soft Landing Odds

**Technical:**

As you can see, we broke the downtrend line once and yesterday pullback has been recovered quickly. We're now well establish above the 50-days MMA. The 50d MMA and the uptrend support line will act as strong support IMO.

**Sentiment:**

 There is a shift in the sentiment, good news trigger more buy behavior than bad news trigger sell off, Microsoft and Tesla Earnings is an example of that. They beat expectations but the bar was lowered, even though guidance is not even rosy or some metrics come out bad (5-y low margin for Tesla) this is not enough to sell.

**Soft Landing:**

The Fed tightened the monetary policy since March 2022, raising rates and (slowly) starting QT. We've seen a couple of quarters with slightly negative GDP growth but strong economic metrics, Q4 GDP growth is better than expected, while inflation is being tamed properly, especially if you look at it on a annualized base. Company guidance are not super rosy, but not apocalyptic either, and when you look at Market's reactions, it feels like it is properly priced. Some might say the Fed (and other central banks) will keep being very hawkish given the current situation (growth, strong job market, market recovery etc.) but people know they cannot take the risk to destroy the economy while being virtually limited by the level of debts of most of the countries. My take is that they will tolerate a higher level of Inflation than usual (around 3-4%) to so the burden of the debt will be bearable (paid by people holding bonds via retirement funds for instance).

**Tech Stocks recovery**

The current strong YTD rebound is led by tech stocks, particularly META, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA and other. Some of these stocks have been crushed in 2022 and were very extended to the downside, mean reversion is happening now and unless there are unexpected events or very gloomy guidance from several of them, there is no reason it would dip again as it did end of 2022

&amp;#x200B;

Beside one very concentrated bet (AMRS), I am not heavily invested. I told most of my positions early December. My current scenario is to come back slowly and buy any major pull back from now as long as the news doesn't change the story :-)

812,StockMarket,"The price return vs. total return of an investment can significantly alter the performance of a dividend-paying stock.

Difference:

The total return is a measure of an investment's performance that considers both the change in price and any income (such as dividends or interest) generated by the investment. It represents an investment's overall gain or loss over a certain period.

Price return, also known as capital return, is a measure of the performance of an investment that only takes into account the change in the price of the investment. It represents the change in the value of the investment due to price movement but does not include any income that the investment generates.

In other words, the total return includes price return and income return, while price return only reflects the investment price change.

The firm also noted that Adani Group has previously been investigated for corruption, money laundering, and theft of taxpayer funds, and that seven of the company's publicly traded firms are vastly overvalued. As a result, Hindenburg has shorted Adani Group companies, betting that their stock prices will fall.

826,StockMarket,"Tesla surpassed Wall Street expectations in highly-anticipated fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, bolstered by record delivery of electric vehicles during the last three months of 2022.

The electric car company posted $24.3bn in revenue, slightly higher than the $24.07bn anticipated by analysts and 33% growth year-over-year, demonstrating that the automaker may be doing a better job than anticipated of weathering concerns about slipping demand for its cars, logistical holdups and ongoing legal drama surrounding its chief executive, Elon Musk.

To address a backslide in demand, Tesla has been slashing prices on its electric cars by up to 30%, bringing the price of its best-selling Model Y vehicle down to $52,990 ‚Äì a drop of $13,000. The move fueled a record 405,278 vehicles sold to customers in the fourth quarter, even as the company missed its 50% annual growth target.

‚ÄúDemand so far year-to-date is strongest in our history,‚Äù Musk said in a call with investors on Wednesday. ‚ÄúPrice changes really make a difference.‚Äù Net profit for the quarter was $3.69bn, or $1.07 per share, compared with $2.32bn, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier.

The report comes as Musk faces a number of lawsuits, testifying this week in a case brought against him by Tesla investors who claim his 2018 tweet about taking the company private cost them millions.

Investors have expressed worry that Musk cannot adequately manage the company after taking over Twitter, which has financially floundered under his leadership, but Wednesday‚Äôs positive report implies Tesla may ultimately come out on top, said Alyssa Altman of consultancy Publicis Sapient.

‚ÄúKnowing it will overcome many of the headwinds it has today with Musk eventually stepping away from Twitter in the near-term and a return from the dive into recession, Tesla‚Äôs future looks bright,‚Äù she said.

Musk defended his involvement with Twitter in the Wednesday call in response to a question about Tesla‚Äôs brand favorability, stating that he has 127 million Twitter followers and is thus ‚Äúreasonably popular‚Äù, and suggested that using the platform is actually beneficial to the car company.

‚ÄúTwitter is actually an incredibly powerful tool for driving demand for Tesla,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI would really encourage companies out, automotive or otherwise, there to make more use of Twitter and to to use their Twitter accounts in ways that are interesting and informative, entertaining and it will help drive sales just as it has with Tesla.‚Äù

The company announced this week plans to expand a manufacturing facility in Nevada and hire 3,000 people as it ramps up production of its heavy-duty, fully electric truck, the Tesla Semi.

Musk said on the call that the company is still on track to start production of its Cybertruck pickup in Texas this year, but it likely will not be available for purchase until next year.

Tesla addressed investor concerns about economic and competitive pressures, saying its ‚Äúrelentless cost control and cost innovation is why we believe no other \[original equipment manufacturer\] is better equipped to navigate through 2023‚Äù.

Musk said in the call that thus far in January the company has seen ‚Äúthe strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history‚Äù. He said the company anticipates production hitting 2m vehicles this year, but it is not formally forecasting that number in case of outside factors like recession.

‚ÄúThe reason we‚Äôre saying 1.8m is because there always seems to be some force majeure around the world,‚Äù he said.

854,StockMarket,"Hey guy's,  it's me again. I just opened a IBKR account and I didn't really know what to say about taxes. So I put my Australian TFN number and also my french TFN. Apparently as a Working Holiday Maker I'm not considered as a resident. But I still pay tax on my payslip or even superannuation (65% by the way ü•∫) 
Should I remove the australian TFN from my account and just keep the french one. And if I get the permanent residency I will change it?

Also in my other post people spoke about HSBC bank as I'm a foreigner. 
Maybe it's not necessary for me to change now before while I'm still in Australia

855,StockMarket,"Hello all,

I am a young student working towards a very lucrative career. If the job market holds for the next few years, I would be looking at job offers at 600-700K. I have been racking my brain as to how I can live the lifestyle I want while also planning for my future. More bluntly, I want to be able to buy that fancy car and have the expensive vacations while also investing and saving for down the road. After crunching raw numbers, it doesn't seem like the 400K take-home will afford me that flexibility,

As such, I have thought about several ways to diversify my income channels (real estate, small business ventures, etc). The problem I see with these ideas is 2-fold: 1) they require considerable investments up front that will reduce my monthly cash flow and 2) most, if not all, require considerable expertise and/or time commitment that are not feasible while also having a full-time job.

I was speaking to a seasoned professional in my field about this same topic (balancing lifestyle with savings) and they told me a regret of theirs was not investing earlier. What really sparked my interest was when they stated they wish they would have taken out extra loans during their college years to invest in things like their 401k. This, as I have come to know, is similar to a margin loan, correct?

Such a strategy somewhat fits what I am looking for: a hands-off income generator that requires a seemingly low initial investment. As I am totally uneducated in things like 401ks, stocks, and margin loans, I am not sure how feasible this plan would be in practice.

So my question is, how reasonable is it for someone making 700k (before taxes) to acquire a 2 million dollar margin loan for stock investments? Assuming an annual contribution of 100K, and an annual ROI of 10% in the stock market, my naive logic leads me to believe I can have enough cash flow to live the type of life I want, add to an already robust portfolio each year all after covering the interest rates on the margin. I suspect these assumptions in this theory are somewhat unrealistic or optimistic at best (the future job market for one, decent interest rates on margin, ROI at 10% or even consistently in the positive direction).

Sorry for the long post, and thanks to anyone who takes the time to read and respond. The reason it's so extensive is that I wanted to clearly lay out my motivation and thought processes so that it all can be critiqued AND challenged with better alternatives given what I am looking for out of my life for the next few years.

866,StockMarket,"Here's a quick take on Tesla's Q4 results. $81.5B is the FY2022 revenue, a growth of 51.4% year over year from FY2021. The gross margin increased for the year from 25.3% to 26.2%. Net income increased 128% from $5.5B to $12.5B. Expect EBITDA to be at least $17.6B this year, an increase of 9% or so from FY2021.

Given these results, the valuations are as follows: the invested capital of Tesla is 5.1x LTM or FY2022 revenue -- remember, this multiple includes Tesla's huge cash balance of over $21b. The EBITDA multiple is about 25x while the earnings multiple (over market cap) is around 30.0x. Based on 2023E results, the earnings multiple should be around 26.0x. In other words, they're coming down like many growth companies that turn the corner and report positive earnings. Tesla was EBITDA positive starting in 2016 and earnings positive starting in 2020. The revenue growth year over year is 51.4% from FY2022. Plus these multiples would be somewhat lower if you took out the cash Tesla has: the actual trading multiple based on its businesses would be more reasonable: 4.7x revenue; 17x EBITDA; 30x earnings.

At $148, Tesla seems to be fairly valued based on continued growth: would expect another 50% sales growth for FY2023 and improving EBITDA and NI margins. The valuation isn't that ridiculous assuming the growth rates and profit margins are reached in 2023 and beyond.

876,StockMarket,"Hey everyone! I've been looking at AT&amp;T as a dividend opportunity and decided to share my research with you so, without further ado... Behold! AT&amp;T. A stock with history and a stock that has been through a lot. You don't see a lot of companies that hit their all-time highs 24 years ago and are still trading at half price apart from Intel, maybe (they've been having a rough patch, too). Now, I last talked about AT&amp;T over a year ago and I didn't really have a lot of nice things to say about it back then, but has the outlook for AT&amp;T changed in 2023? Well, let's see!

# Operations

First of all, AT&amp;T's operations are showing growth in numbers. The telecom company added 2.9 million postpaid wireless subscriptions, 280 thousand fiber net subscription marking the 12th consecutive quarter of more than 200 thousand additions! In terms of 5G, AT&amp;T now covers 150 million people, too! Overall, these are very solid results and better than what analysts and AT&amp;T's management expected.

# Profits

What about revenue, earnings and all that? In 2023, AT&amp;T brought in 120.7 billion dollars in revenue and adjusted earnings per share were 2.57 dollars. Reported EPS was actually negative 1.1 dollars, but that was due to non-cash charges, mainly around impairments. AT&amp;T's free cash flow was a 14.1 billion dollars which is okay, but it's not great by any means. The management's forward guidance was also decent. The expectations for 2023 are growth in wireless and broadband of 4% or more, capital investments of about 24 billion dollars, similar to 2022, free cash flow of 16 billion dollars or better which is an expected increase of 12% although AT&amp;T does expect to see a slight drop in earnings per share.

Overall, AT&amp;T performed well in 2022 and is expecting slow, but steady growth in 2023. On the good side, it seems that the Warner Media spin off has not impacted AT&amp;T's business in the way I thought it would. The operations are looking leaner. After we exclude the non-cash impairments, operating expenses in Q4 have actually dropped a bit from 26.2 billion in the year-ago quarter to 25.8 in this quarter. However, there are two big risk considerations here.

# The Two Main Risks

First of all, the free cash flow. We are seeing a pretty significant drop from previous years due to the Warner Media spin off. Less free cash flow means less security when it comes to dividend. It also means less money left over for capital investments. Overall, less free cash flow equals lower chances of growth and less money being returned to shareholders. At the end of the day, as investors, we want to make a profit and seeing this drop with AT&amp;T is expected, but still worrying. That is definitely something to keep an eye on. The good thing is that, like we saw, management expects higher free cash flow in 2023, but that is still just an expectation and not a fact.

The second and much bigger problem I'm seeing is debt. I've never been a fan of companies that rely too much on debt and have a high leverage. I understand why they would do that and with the extremely low interest rates of the last 10 to 12 years, it makes absolute sense. However, it does make a company more fragile and more susceptible during tough economic conditions. Historically, telecomms have been hit harder during recessions, too, which means that AT&amp;T is not really well-positioned for the upcoming year in my opinion. As of the end of the 2022 financial year, AT&amp;T has $135.9 billion dollars in debt. That's a lot considering their equity was 122.4 billion at the end of the third quarter! Their interest payments for 2021 were 7.67 billion dollars. It is looking like the 2022 interest payments will be similar, but given the rising interest rates, it is only a matter of time before the increased interest payments start weighing down on AT&amp;T.

# Valuation

Now, these are two big issues that AT&amp;T desperately needs to work on to get their business in order. However, does AT&amp;T's current price and dividend justify the risk? Let's take a look. I'll be looking at the adjusted ratios because they reflect the underlying business better. AT&amp;T's trailing adjusted PE ratio is only 6.7 and their forward adjusted PE ratio is 7.4. Historically, these are a bit lower since the 5-year average for AT&amp;T stands at 8.7 and 8.9 respectively. However, let's look at their main competitors, Verizon and T-Mobile. Verizon has PE ratios of 7.8 and 8.2 respectively, whereas T-Mobile stands at 21.7 and 66.8 although T-Mobile really has a much different business model and focuses on growth without paying a dividend. In terms of forward price-to-cash-flow, AT&amp;T has the lowest at 4 versus Verizon's 4.5 and T-Mobile's 11.1. It is also lower than it's 5-year historical average which stands at 4.6. Finally, AT&amp;T is again cheapest when it comes to price-to-book with only 1.1 versus 1.7 for Verizon and 2.6 for T-Mobile and historical average of 1.2. Overall, we can see that AT&amp;T is trading at some discount to both its historical performance and its competitors so there is some compensation for the risks that I've outlined above.

# Dividend

Finally, the dividend is one of the biggest arguments for AT&amp;T. Despite the recent dividend cut, AT&amp;T still yields about 5.8% which is a very decent yield. Unfortunately, it is below Verizon's 6.5% yield and below the 5-year historical AT&amp;T average of 6.6%. The payout ratio is similar to Verizon's as both companies have between 45 to 50% there. Plus, chances are AT&amp;T will not raise its dividend until its financials have become improved while Verizon has been showing a slow, but steady annualized dividend growth of 2.5% over the last 10 years.

# Conclusion

So, what's my final take on AT&amp;T? Honestly, it's hard to see a strong bullish case for the company. Best case scenario, the AT&amp;T stock is a weak buy simply because it has some turnaround potential. However, I personally would not make it a big bet given that I'm not expecting a very rosy economic outlook ahead. In fact, I would avoid both AT&amp;T and Verizon and instead simply buy some of the Charles Schwab's Dividend Equity ETF. It's a lot more reliable and, while it has a much lower dividend yield, it offers a much better total return in my opinion while being exposed to a lot less risk. I may consider buying AT&amp;T if and only if the price drops further down, maybe about $16. Remember, AT&amp;T is a company that hits its all-time high 24 years ago and is heading into a possible recession with a massive debt burden. There are simply better options on the market.

881,StockMarket,"How they differ: 

Trading weekly and monthly options both have their pros and cons. Which ones you trade should depend on your risk tolerance and trading strategy.

Weekly options expire at the end of the trading week, typically on a Friday. On the other hand, monthly options expire at the month's end. The key difference between the two is the time horizon they offer. Weekly options provide traders with more short-term opportunities to profit, while monthly options offer a longer-term perspective.¬†

Additionally, weekly options typically have higher [implied volatility](https://haikhuu.com/education/iv-crush), which can make them more expensive, while monthly options tend to be more stable and less volatile. This can benefit traders looking to take advantage of short-term price movements or hedge positions.

&amp;#x200B;

Theta Decay Considerations:

The theta decay of weekly options is much more aggressive when trading weekly options. Since they expire much sooner than monthly options, you have less time to be right in your trade.

[Theta decay](https://haikhuu.com/education/theta-decay-options-greeks-guide) of monthly options is much less aggressive since they have much more time until expiration. So essentially, monthly options are more stable than weekly options since they aren‚Äôt affected by theta as much.¬†

900,StockMarket,"Sen. Josh Hawley has introduced a bill that would ban members of Congress from trading and owning stocks, using the name of his legislation to take a jab at Rep. Nancy Pelosi

Hawley on Tuesday introduced the Pelosi Act ‚Äî¬†or the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act ‚Äî renewing a legislative push to curtail stock trading by lawmakers that has failed over the last few years.

‚ÄúMembers of Congress and their spouses shouldn‚Äôt be using their position to get rich on the stock market,‚Äù Hawley tweeted in announcing his bill.

The GOP senator previously introduced legislation last year seeking to ban lawmakers and their spouses from holding stocks or making new transactions while in office.

The Hill has reached out to Pelosi‚Äôs office for comment.

Hawley, like a number of other Republicans, has focused on the former Speaker and her family in pushing to ban stock trading by members of Congress.

Last year Pelosi‚Äôs husband, Paul Pelosi, sold millions of dollars worth of shares of a computer chipmaker as the House prepared to vote on a bill focused on domestic chip manufacturing. A spokesman for Pelosi said at the time that he sold the shares at a loss.

Members of both parties signaled interest in legislation barring stock trades after then-Sen. Richard Burr, who at the time was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, unloaded stocks at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently closed a probe of his trading activities without taking action.

Lawmakers have yet to be able to come up with a plan that garners enough support from both sides of the aisle to get a bill through Congress. Democrats in 2022 scrapped a plan to vote on such legislation before the midterm elections, even after Pelosi reversed course and expressed openness to colleagues voting for stock trading reform.

Along with Hawley‚Äôs bill, a bipartisan duo in the House has introduced a bill this year on the topic. Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Chip Roy introduced the Trust in Congress Act this month, marking the third time the pair have introduced the legislation.

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell in early trading on Wednesday as traders pored through the latest batch of corporate earnings.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures declined by 222 points, or 0.66%. Nasdaq-100 futures shed 1.3%, and S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.8%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Microsoft dropped 2%. Initially shares rose after the tech giant posted fiscal second quarter per-share earnings that exceeded analysts‚Äô estimates. However, shares declined after the company offered lackluster guidance on its earnings call.
*****
&gt; Investors are bracing for more high-profile corporate earnings amid fears of a recession. So far, more than 70 S&amp;P 500 companies have reported fourth-quarter earnings, and 65% of them posted stronger-than-expected results, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWith the bulk of earnings still in front of the market, the question as to whether the shift towards growth being signaled by recent rallies is warranted could be answered by upside earnings surprises and solid guidance,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial.

Once you've taken the blue pill and realize the fair market thesis that has been law for a generation is wrong then you may question what to do next:

* Stop investing, maybe, but then again I'm still under the belief that Warren Buffet's thesis that markets will eventually correct is true. Sadly it does mean a sharp correction in our economy must occur
* Join the bandwagon and use the tactics here to start manipulating, I don't judge others, but personally I'd rather go to the grave then sell my soul. I am specifically referring the corrupt tactics. Normal shorting circumstances (if you want to call it that) is actually good for markets. It creates volatility, and without it you'd risk stagflation which is the one of the ingredients that led to Germany's downfall after WWI. 
* Stay invested or HODL (as many put it), again maybe, but that would depend on the company's strength and your time horizon. Earnings reports and cash flow are important to stay abreast on, and the moat which includes the leaders at the helm and their strategy

958,StockMarket,"Microsoft shares rose in extended trading on Tuesday after the company reported fiscal second quarter financials that topped analysts‚Äô estimates.

Here‚Äôs how the company did:

Earnings: $2.32 per share, adjusted, vs. $2.29 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue: $52.75 billion, vs. $52.94 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Microsoft‚Äôs total revenue increased by 2% year over year in that quarter ending Dec. 31, the slowest rate since 2016, according to a statement. Net income fell to $16.43 billion from $18.77 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company took a $1.2 billion charge in the quarter in connection with its decision to cut 10,000 employees, revise its hardware lineup and consolidate leases.

The decision to reduce head count ‚Äúshows a commitment to margin defense despite top-line shakiness,‚Äù analysts at Raymond James wrote in a note to clients Monday. They recommend buying Microsoft shares.

In the quarter the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued Microsoft to block its pending $69 billion acquisition of game publisher Activision Blizzard, while the U.S. Defense Department awarded Microsoft and three other companies a cloud contract worth up to $9 billion combined. Also, Microsoft introduced Designer, an application in which people can craft documents such as social media posts and event invitations.

All trading occurred (so far, 15 minutes to do) within yesterday's candle; therefore, there shouldn't be any major changes in terms of support or resistance levels.  Of note, it looks like neither the SPY nor the QQQ will officially break out of their bear channels...at least not today, unless either or both shoot up in the final minutes, I guess.  The SPY currently look the most 'at risk' of failing the breakout entire, by closing back down inside its bear channel.  QQQ looks slightly more comfortably above, bolstered by the gap-fill support level it is sitting on top of (having just filled it yesterday).

My next add level is the support zone between 80.00 and 77.00 -- at which point I will look at a 1.5 - 2% tranche depending on if/how price moves to this level.  My current cost average is underneath where a technical snapback could send price to the former support TL/breakdown TL, and the positon ITM.  We will have to see how price moves to this level, as that TL is now major resistance (not to mention the 20 DMA, and the 25% Fib retrace level).

964,StockMarket,"ITM options have intrinsic value and a higher probability of being exercised, while ATM options have no intrinsic value and a lower probability of being exercised. 

&amp;#x200B;

ITM Options:

ITM options are options that have intrinsic value, which means that the option's strike price is favorable to the underlying asset's price. For example, if the underlying asset is a stock trading at $50 and the call option strike price is $45, the option is considered ITM (in-the-money).¬† 

This is because the option holder has the right to buy the stock at $45 while the stock is trading at $50, giving the holder a $5 profit. ITM options tend to have a higher premium than other options and are considered to have a higher probability of being exercised. 

&amp;#x200B;

ATM Options: 

ATM options, on the other hand, have no intrinsic value. They are options with a strike price equal to the current market price of the underlying asset. For example, if the underlying asset is a stock trading at $50 and the call option strike price is $50, the option is considered at-the-money.¬†

This means that the option holder has the right to buy the stock at the current market price, so the holder doesn't have any profit or loss. ATM options have the highest amount of extrinsic value.¬†

With tech stocks gaining momentum during at the start of the year and some optimism over next week's Fed announcement, publicly traded telecom companies may see a boost. Verizon posted Q4 earnings today with beat on EPS and revenue. AT&amp;T is due to report earnings tomorrow. Both of these were among the stocks that showed significantly large moves as the market opened today and lead to volatility halts due to a technical issue on Wall Street.

Technically minded investors might also see a double bottom and consolidation into a falling wedge , though that last candle might cause some hesitation.

**By the numbers**: LUMN has seen a decline in revenue since its spin-off from CenturyLink in 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, LUMN reported revenue of $5.1 billion, which was a decrease of 4.5% compared to the same period in 2019.

In terms of valuation, LUMN currently has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 2.63, which is lower than the industry average of 21.5. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 0.41, which is also lower than the industry average of 1.3.

The markets also made preparations for the Fed's monetary policy announcement next week, as the central bank is anticipated to ease off on its tightening program. The Leading Economic Index report, which showed a tenth consecutive monthly decline and raised Fed expectations, was the only item on the light economic calendar.

I really expect that while we are around this $400 range, the general movements in the markets will be relatively slower in anticipation of watching which direction we hold. In the case we break out, continue to hold your strong positions and make sure to set stops in guaranteed profit to limit your downside risk. In the case we hold and start selling below $400, look to close out positions, realize some gains, and hedge open positions.

# [Stock futures dip after back-to-back gains on Wall Street](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/23/stock-market-news-live-updates-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures dipped slightly Tuesday as investors struggled to continue a strong start to the week during a busy stretch of corporate earnings.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 100 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures slipped 0.3%, and Nasdaq-100 futures pulled back by 0.4%.
*****
&gt; The moves in futures comes after a solid start to the week on Wall Street. On Monday, the Nasdaq Composite led with a gain of 2.01%. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow added 1.19% and 0.76%, respectively. It was the second straight positive day for the major averages, and all three are up in 2023.
*****
&gt; The gains have come despite an underwhelming start to earnings season and more signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, with some expected the rally to level off.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe do not see much scope for markets to rally in the near term, especially given our outlook for continued pressure on corporate profit growth,‚Äù wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment office at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Tuesday note to clients.
*****
&gt; That‚Äôs in part because Monday‚Äôs close levels sits above the firm‚Äôs respective June and December price targets for the S&amp;P of 3,700 and 4,000.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues Tuesday with results from software giant Microsoft after the bell.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm working on revamping my investment portfolio. One of the elements that I want to expand on is the technology sub-portfolio. It will be a long-term investment (yes, I could have invested in that way earlier). For that reason, I'm looking into adding AI ETF's.

One of the things that caught my attention is that most AI ETF's have a pretty big spot in robotics, semiconductor or broad tech companies (e.x. Amazon is mentioned a lot in AI ETF portfolio's - Amazon does invest a lot in AI, but the risk with other departments like ecommerce is pretty high in my opinion). Since there are dedicated semiconductor ETF's (and already in my portfolio), I'm trying to find AI ETF's that are focused on, yes, AI (+25% portfolio exposure). 

I have found the following ETF's list with exposure: [https://etfdb.com/themes/artificial-intelligence-etfs/](https://etfdb.com/themes/artificial-intelligence-etfs/) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Do you have any recommendations, tips or info that could help me find a good AI ETF? And what strategy do you use regarding AI investing? Why do you think that's a good strategy?**

1040,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**:  All 3x majors added to the up-moves from Friday, and all are now out of the bear channel resistance.  My bias is neutral-to-positive in the coming days-to-week timeframe, basically leading into the Fed statement; I could see consolidation &amp; 'floating up' into that speech.  From a technical perspective, there are numerous resistance levels lingering just above where the current price action is, so a little more upside into the Fed would be a good thing to see before we ultimately head lower in the weeks-to-months timeframe.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY:**  Finally, a break out from the bear channel -- but compared to QQQ, much less 'conviction' in the move, as it closed just over the TL.  Price must close above 402.65 before re-entering the bear channel; if it can, then the descending TL becomes major support.  Major resistance is 410.49 pivot high.   Major support is flag's top at 387.41, which is also now converging with the flag's ascending TL which helped lead to this breakout. 

https://preview.redd.it/1vgo2gw19vda1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9d9fa18cd6a551c52ddd88e255f7383126158e28

**QQQ:**  Finally, a break out from the bear channel -- and compared to IWM, more similar volume vs Friday's move higher.  Price must close above 290.21 before re-entering the bear channel for that descending TL to be viewed as a major support level.  Nearest resistance is 293.66 the 200 DMA, with major resistance at 296.88 pivot high.  Major support remains the  274.78 flag's top and ascending TL convergence. 

https://preview.redd.it/5gcnurzh8vda1.jpg?width=2311&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=43d96b3bd2285b179d10b4e3379c05b17ba302b2

**IWM**: Another solid move up; however, note the significantly less volume today vs. Friday's candle.  Another up day on even lighter volume may suggest exhaustion. Major resistance is 189.56 pivot high. Major support is around 177 ascending TL from late December.  I would like to see either some more time or a 'higher high' be put in before I believe the bear channel descending TL will offer much support.

Even though I know this is the wrong thing to do, I may again add, but only a 0.1% tranche...and only if 1) price reaches over 370; 2) volume is lighter than today; and 3) options price falls sub-2.00 -- if these conditions happen, then we may see a reversal off what would be a 3-day surge on falling volume.

[AMD 2022 Q3 Financials](https://preview.redd.it/tpv4p3480uda1.jpg?width=3266&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=429b52d28aaef8b358a7c2bbdf2f67cd24a4d46a)

**Intel** is a multinational corporation and technology company that designs and manufactures microprocessors, computer components, and other technology products. The company is the largest and most profitable maker of microprocessors in the world and also competes with AMD in the microprocessor market.

In recent years, Intel has reported mixed financial performance, driven by the slowdown in PC sales and delay of its 7nm products. The company's revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.8% from 2016 to 2020. The operating income has grown at a CAGR of 0.7% over the same period, while net income has grown at a CAGR of -1.2%.

The company's return on equity (ROE) has also been moderate, averaging around 14% over the past five years. This indicates that the company is generating a moderate return on the money that shareholders have invested in the business.

**Next earnings report Jan 26, 2023. Expected move +/-6.6%**

[INTC 2022 Q3 Financials](https://preview.redd.it/u6x2kjq30uda1.jpg?width=1616&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=07f2663a827018d9dc0f674c57f8743b155ed017)

**Next earnings report Feb 15, 2023. Expected move +/-9%**

[NVDA 2022 Q3 Financials](https://preview.redd.it/a68qd4xtztda1.png?width=1520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e8070df066a469a2147422fb9ccbd0d82a1de1a2)

# How they stack up against one another

All three companies have reported strong financial performance in recent years, driven by growing demand for their products in areas such as gaming, data center, and artificial intelligence. NVDA has been performing well due to strong demand for gaming and AI, while INTC has been struggling with the slowdown of PC sales and the delay of its 7nm products. AMD has been seeing strong growth in its Ryzen and EPYC product lines, and has been taking market share from INTC.

Overall, all three companies are well-established players in the technology industry with a strong track record of innovation and financial performance. However, NVIDIA and AMD are seen as more growth-oriented companies, while Intel is seen as more of a value play.

# Potential trades

Here are a few short term trade ideas for each of these names to allow you to capture some profit through earnings but also protect against a downward move.

**Least capital intensive: INTC**

Buy 1 $23p, Buy 1 $23.50p, Sell 3 $25.50p all expiring 2/10/23

**Highest annualized yield: AMD**

**Variable (can exit early for potentially higher annualized return): NVDA**

Buy 1 $190c, Sell 1 $192.50c, Sell 1 $152.50p, all expiring 2/24/23

1069,StockMarket,"I personally believe that most of Warren Buffet‚Äôs stocks would be a good investment for regular retail investors. Most of Berkshire Hathaway's money is in blue chip stocks which tend to be the stocks with the least risk, which is why I would recommend investing in Berkshire Hathaway as a whole. 

Nonetheless, I personally believe that regular investors should particularly invest in Apple and Amazon. Both companies are very consumer centric and regular investors understand how Apple and Amazon make money, since regular investors themselves are also clients of those companies.

**1. Apple**  
Since over 10 years apple has been a company with exponential growth,  
In their q3 financial statement of 2022 Apple published a net profit of margin of 23%, with a net income of almost 21 billion dollars, which is a lot for a company of that size.  
In 2021 Apple recorded a net income of 95 billion dollars, in comparison Amazon recorded a net income of 33 billion.  
Apple is still over 20% down from their all time high.  
Apples PS (price to sales) ratio is 5.54

**2. Amazon**  
Amazon, in only one quarter, documented a revenue of 127.1 billion dollars.  
Amazon's information is easily accessible to the public  
Amazon is over 45% down from it's all time high.  
By far the biggest e retailer in the market  
According to analysts at CNN, Amazon‚Äôs stock forecast would have a target of 134 dollars and a high estimate of 164 dollars. At the moment Amazon's stock price is at 97 dollars.  
Amazons PS ratio is 2.3

**3. Berkshire Hathaway b**  
Regroups all Berkshire Hathaway stock  
Stock price is at a steady increase  
Berkshire Hathaway b is 13% down from it's all time high and is slowly catching up.  
The company as a whole owns holdings in different supply chains helping diversify their investments.  
Revenue of 76 billion dollars in the third quarter of 2022  
Berkshire Hathaway's PS Ratio is 2.7

1072,StockMarket,"European and American options are similar, but some key differences make a big difference depending on your trading strategy.¬† 

&amp;#x200B;

European Options:

European style options are a type of financial contract that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specific price (strike price) on the expiration date.

You cannot exercise European options before the expiration date.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Advantages:

If you are trading multi-leg structures where an early assignment will ruin the structure, then European options are better.

Box spreads, for example, are risk-free for European options since they can‚Äôt be assigned early.

However, if you trade box spreads on American options, then you have risk potential. 

 

American Options

American options give the owner the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specific price at or before the expiration date.¬†

American options can be exercised anytime before the expiration date, while you can only exercise European options on the expiration date.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Advantages:

The advantages of American options depend on the trading strategy you are using. If the strategy you trade requires you to exercise the options before expiration, American style options are the best choice.¬†

# [Stock futures are flat as investors weigh the Fed‚Äôs next policy move and await a busy earnings week](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/22/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Monday as investors weighed a potential slowdown, or pause, from the Federal Reserve and braced for a busy earnings week.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 19 points, or 0.06%. S&amp;P 500 futures inched 0.03% higher, while Nasdaq 100 rose 0.13%.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the major averages rallied to finish the week after briefly losing the momentum of the January rally. The Nasdaq posted a slight gain for the week. However, the Dow and S&amp;P each logged losing own weeks. All of the major averages remain in the green for the month. The Nasdaq is leading the others with a 6.44% year-to-date gain.
*****
&gt; Investors have been weighing the possibility that the Fed is getting ready to slow the pace of its inflation-fighting rate hikes after economic data last week showed a decline in wholesale prices and retail sales.
*****
&gt; On Friday, investors absorbed comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller favoring a quarter percentage point rate increase at the next meeting. A Wall Street Journal report Sunday, meanwhile, raised the possibility of a spring pause to rate increases ‚Äî a sign that the Fed could be nearing the end of its rate hiking campaign.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWith investors growing more confident on the inflation side, it is clear they are now looking beyond the current hiking cycle, to an eventual pause and potentially even cuts down the line,‚Äù wrote Deutsche Bank strategist Henry Allen in a note to clients Monday. ‚ÄúBut with investors now priced for good news on inflation, the risk is that if inflation does prove more persistent, then we could be in another bear market rally just as we saw last summer.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Markets have priced in a 99.7% chance of a 25-basis point hike, according to CME Group data, which would bring the interest rate to a targeted range of 4.5%-4.75%.
*****
&gt; No speeches from Fed officials are on the calendar ahead of the central bank policy meeting on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. Investors, however, will monitor another batch of economic data, including the Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditure price index, due out Friday.
*****
&gt; In the meantime, earnings reports could keep the market on edge, with about 40% of the Dow scheduled to release their latest financial results and offer more insight into how companies are weathering inflation and interest rates. Some of the big names on deck include Microsoft, IBM, Tesla, Visa and Mastercard.

1106,StockMarket,"Rithm Capital is the fourth largest non-bank owner of US mortgages. This sub is full of dividend chasers and their yield is 11% so I think I should tell you what I know. The stock is at best priced fairly, but it may be overvalued as fines and lawyer fees are a regular cost of business. Note I speak mostly of NewRez but the courts don't distinguish between them and Shellpoint most of the other affiliates service these two companies with things like title insurance, property appraisal, rental properties, and such.

I found out about them through one of their subsidiaries NewRez. I recently got a mortgage and my home bank sold the loan to some investment bank immediately repackaged it and sold it to NewRez. I tried to set up an account with them to make automatic payments, but the ""create account"" page said an account already existed in my name and the login page was impossible since I was never given my username/password/recovery email. I called customer service, and they went through the motions of fixing it before ""escalating to IT,"" but I could tell the lady I was dealing with has seen this problem a hundred times before so I assumed the website was down. That was in December, and I never received contact from no IT, nor can I log in.

I made my payments over their automated phone system, but I suspected something fishy. I spoke to my bank confirming I did have to deal with these NewRez guys directly, and they confirmed the charges for principal, interest, and escrow were accurate. I didn't know if there was a fast one going on or if this was just a brand new ma and pa venture that didn't know what they were doing. This is why I was surprised when googling them revealed 10-12 thousand employees and licenses to issue loans. But.......

EVERYTHING ON THEIR ""ABOUT US"" PAGE IS A LIE.

They do not have experienced loan officers. As one ex-employ said they'd ""rather have 3 employees close on 2 loans a month than 1 close 6."" He didn't say how they wasted manpower, but these guys are paid mostly on commission so you see the lack of incentive on the management part. Other employee reviews said management swore at employees routinely and that sales teams got parties in 5-star hotels while mass layoffs occurred. That was in the last year, older employee reviews from the early days of the company all said they were cheapskates. They were underpaid for bankers, the offices were minimalist, and the company was very small.

They claim to lead in product innovation but only have vague bull about how that is. Customer reviews show that overwhelmingly they get loans by buying them from other banks rather than issuing them through their website. Hard to change contracts you didn't write...

Of course, they boast ""Ease of Process"" despite my experience debunking that. However, customer reviews are consistently one star (except for a large number of obviously faked reviews). Complaints included:

1. Only being informed that NewRez bought the loan the day that payment was due.
2. Customer accidentally double-paying, NewRez allegedly refunding, but no payment received (someone stole the money).
3. Several being unable to set up accounts.
4. Loan granted from NewRez and purchase contract signed, but NewRez failed to deliver funds (lawsuit threatened).
5. Automatic payment systems simply not working and NewRez refusing to remove late fees.
6. Veterans getting home loans but NewRez refusing to file tax exemption paperwork.

They also claim to be involved in highly localized charities, but I find no evidence of their existence. Also, these charities are funded by employees applying for ""grants"" for local communities, so I have no idea if these are promos or slush funds.

AND THE LAWSUITS. OH, THE LAWSUITS!

I wonder how they turn a profit considering how often the lose class action suits costing between 300k and 4.4 million each. Some of my favorites:

1. That whole ""trip you up so you have to pay a late fee."" Yeah, that happened at least 4,000 times.
2. By law, when soldiers go on deployment, their loan payments are deferred. NewRez did not just attempt to forclose multiple times, they tried to convince the soldiers they had to pay multiple times.
3. NewRez prematurely informed credit agencies that a mortgage was being written off as a loss, destroying a family's credit enough that they were denied the very refinancing loan they needed to pay NewRez.
4. NewRez systemically lied on their loan default notices, saying customers had to catch up on payments before whatever arbitrary date they sold the house. That is not how that works, if you catch up you get your house back.
5. NewRez employee time clocks counted bonuses and overtime wages as the same. When bonuses were canceled, thousands of employees were denied overtime pay.
6. Town in New York State had to sue NewRez in order to get them to demolish a condemned building.
7. Pay-to-Pay policy where NewRez bought loans and then charged customers to make accounts with them to pay the loans.
8. Customer charged for home insurance they didn't need or ask for (times two cases).
9. Customer charged for a ""drive-by inspection"" that NewRez neither needed nor informed the customer of.

The list goes on, and on, and on. Noteworthy note only have they never won any of these cases, but they're usually settled out of court because the law is clear on their liability. I can only imagine the lawyers of the company constantly putting out fires, and wonder why if they've ever insisted on reviewing company practices to find potential future liabilities... But I guess that's what responsible companies do.

This is what NewRez's official fee structure looks like:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dkii9engdqda1.jpg?width=2550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=abeb3d84354ce15ce0e1521e0372b66db3e7724f

The convenience fee is listed as zero because they were sued for charging that. Most of these fees are completely arbitrary, charging only if they feel like it. Official reviewers of the company said the company was legit but there was a ""lack of transparency"" as no one knows how the fees and rules work. My particular favorite is the above document says that if NewRez sues the customer, they might send the customer the bill for the lawyer (I don't know if it ever happened).

Particularly concerning for me is I wanted to pay more than what is required each month in order to reduce my interest load over time. But there's a completely arbitrary ""prepayment fee"" that I have to ""see loan documents for."" I don't have their loan documents because I frickin got my loan through a bank I could actually trust, dammit! There's also an arbitrary fee for getting loan documents that I shouldn't need to pay. If I get charged for that, I'm totally suing.

And their affiliates not connected to mortgages aren't better. Genesis Capital LLC (not to be confused with the digital currency firm) is a business loan company and the SEC charged them in 2019 for failing to disclose conflicts of interest. One of the managing partners N. Gary Price simply left the disclosure form blank, and it was filed with no edits suggested by anyone at the company.

The corporate history of Rithm is after the 2008 crash, a group of investors decided to buy up all the mortgages they could for dirt cheap. The company was pretty minimalist, but gathered more and more investors and went public so they could simply buy more and more mortgages. Their dividends increased in this period even though their stock price was volatile and stagnant. They lost big in 2020 with Covid making them suspend dividends and again lost big in 2022 with rising interest rates decimating the value of their existing loans. Their dividends and stock price now sits well below their historic average.

Their initial success can be ascribed to recovery from the credit crunch (everyone is a genius in a bull market). However, their incompetence and corruption cause many high abnormal costs, although they can still force people to do business with them by buying up loans from reputable banks. However, they are degenerates, and you can expect to slowly lose money over time at a rate equal to management's pay.

I personally make no bets. Short sales are expensive with dividend-paying companies, and they trade at a 4.5 PE ratio as well as many other prodigiously low valuations. It seems I am not the first to find out how they work, and their stock may be actually fairly priced. There are also major risks associated with interest rates, where now that interest rates are high there are few new loans for NewRez to buy. If interest rates fall again, suddenly new loans will turn less profitable as they did in 2020 so why would NewRez want to buy them? I'm sure NewRez will handle these problems in the worst way possible.",Stay Away from $RITM,1674452643

1124,StockMarket,"This is probably a simple concept for a lot of people on here. But for those who don't understand the relationship between interest rates and equity prices, this is a very valuable and quick lesson to understand. When the Fed raises interest rates, stock prices tend to decrease, as we are seeing right now. There are several reasons for this, the main of which I have summarised below.

**Borrowing costs**

When interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing surges meaning companies have less capital to invest and expand. If a baker is paying 10% interest on his loans all of a sudden, that‚Äôs a lot less dough to play with‚Ä¶ This slows down profit growth, which ultimately constrains stock prices.

**Safer investments**

Government bonds are considered safer than shares in companies which can go bankrupt. That‚Äôs why bonds aren‚Äôt known for bountiful yields because they are considered to be a safe house for investment. But when rates do climb, they become irresistible to investors who sell some stocks in pursuit of more secure returns.

I mean who doesn't want to lend money to a group of people who can't even agree on a budget...?

**Less spending**

When interest rates are low, consumers take out credit cards and swipe left and right like they‚Äôre on Tinder. When rates rise, people have less disposable income as their mortgage payments increase, and cheap credit becomes lacking. This reduces sales and the overall economy's growth, reducing company profits and stock prices.

Moral of the story? Don't fight the fed.

***Summary of Barclays' Jan18th Note -&gt; The Global Volatility Pulse: Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Does It***

**""Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold Does It""**

* *Signs of slowing inflation &amp; less severe slowdowns in activity improve the prospects of 'soft landings' in the US...*
* *Recessions in Europe are now expected to be shallower than previously feared, which coupled w/China's abrupt shift away from its zero-COVID policy, fueled the second largest 3m outperformance of European vs. US equities*

**Earnings-Relation Options: ""Nothing to See Here""**

* *Average implied move for S&amp;P's largest companies has dropped to the long-term average from near-record highs last quarter (breaking a streak of six consecutive quarterly increases), indicating investors feel relatively confident about 4Q22 results.*
* *Skew (downside vs. upside vol) on credit ETFs has recently cheapened significantly (closing the gap with equity skew), as relative demand for Calls surged.*
* *With credit rallying along duration, cheapening skew may also be reflective of option markets pricing-in the unusual positive correlation between bonds vs. credit/risky assets.*

**Earnings-Relation Options: ""Nothing to See Here""**

* *Average current implied move among a universe of US stocks with liquid options is 4.6%*
* *Current implied move is in-line with the long term average (4.6%) and significantly lower than last quarter (6.4%). It is also in-line with the level suggested by the VIX, based on their historical relationship.*
   * *In other words... equity markets are currently signaling that 4Q22 results should not result in unusually large surprises.*

1147,StockMarket,"Hey Everyone,
First time posting on here. Me and my fianc√© are working on reallocating our money in our retirement fund to reduce some risk to the downside over the coming year. Right now 100% of these funds are in a general S&amp;P index. We are thinking about selling 80% of that and basically reinvesting in what would essentially be a variety of indexes that make up the S&amp;P, with some of the riskier sectors left out. Plan is to hold these for at least 6 months, possibly longer depending on economy. Let me know what you think.

20% S&amp;P index fund
XLK - 5%
XLI - 5%
XLP - 20.25%
XLU - 10%
XLB - 2.5%
XLV - 18%
XLC - 5%
XLE - 5.5%
5% Sin Stocks - BUD, TAP, MO, PM

Essentially we‚Äôre leaving out Financials, Real Estate, and Consumer Discretionary.

Remaining 23.75% we plan on using to DCA into individual stocks we like for the long run - Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Semiconductors (Nvidia, AMD, etc), etc.",Working on our own ‚Äúsafer‚Äù Index for the recession,1674363141

* *Flows into mutual funds &amp; related investment products showed elevated demand across equities &amp; fixed income, plus another surge in cross-border flows.*
* *Net flows into* ***global equity funds*** *remained positive in the week ending January 20th, driven by strong flows into EM (emerging market) equity funds (+$8bn vs. +$7bn in the week prior). Flows into global EM benchmarks &amp; mainland China-dedicated equity funds were especially strong.*
* ***US &amp; UK continued to see outflows*** *while Western Europe ex-UK were positive for the second week in a row.*
* *At the sector level, flows were more subdued -&gt; cyclical &amp; defensive sectors both saw net outflows.*
* *Flows into* ***global fixed income funds*** *were fairly strong - including those into riskier sectors, in line with Goldman's strategy team's expectations of a shift from ""TINA"" to ""TARA"" (+$14bn vs. +$17bn in the week prior).*
   * *Agg-type funds &amp; IG Credit saw the largest inflows in dollar terms; investors showed a clear preference for long-duration bond funds vs. short-duration &amp; inflation-protected bond funds.*
   * *EM fixed income saw inflows across hard &amp; local currency bond funds.*
   * *Money Market fund assets increased by less than $1bn*
* *Cross-border* ***FX flows*** *were strong once again... likely reflecting a boost in global risk sentiment.*
   * *EUR &amp; CNY have clearly seen stronger foreign flows over the past 2 weeks -&gt; but some of this has occurred alongside elevated flows globally overall.*

1149,StockMarket,"I am curious to know which stocks you believe have the potential for strong growth and success in the next 1-10 years. Are there any stocks that you believe will perform well in the near future, as well as those that you think have the potential for significant growth but may not yet be at their peak? In other words, which stocks do you think will be good short-term investments and which do you think will be long-term investments?

To avoid this being a post of people cherry picking stocks other recommend, I'll say to those who read this: When it comes to investing in stocks, there are a variety of factors to consider and different strategies that can be employed depending on an individual's goals and risk tolerance.

When thinking about short-term investments, one might look for stocks that are currently undervalued but have strong fundamentals and a solid track record of performance. These types of stocks may be poised for a quick rebound or have a catalyst, such as a new product launch or a change in management, that could drive the stock price up in the near future.

On the other hand, when thinking about long-term investments, one might look for stocks that have a strong growth potential over the next several years. These types of stocks may be in emerging industries or have disruptive business models that could drive significant growth in the future. However, these types of stocks may also be more volatile and may not perform well in the short term.

It's important to note that predicting the stock market is difficult and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. It's also important to have a diversified portfolio and proper risk management strategy in place. It's always recommended to consult a financial advisor before making any investment decision.

My goal for the post is more to get application of fundamentals and technical analysis. I feel like it's easy to say ""Hey look for this"" but I think sharing some companies that tick the boxes and prompt some good discussion could help educate others on not just what to look for, but also showcase some of the ""why"" factors as well.

# **Stocks close higher Friday, Nasdaq notches third straight week of wins - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/19/stock-futures-tick-up-after-dow-goes-negative-for-the-year.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks rallied on Friday to finish the week strong after briefly losing the momentum of the January rally.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 330.93 points, or 1%, to close at 33,375.49, while the S&amp;P 500 advanced 1.89% to 3,972.61. Both indexes snapped a three-day losing streak. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.66%, with help from Netflix and Alphabet, to end the day at 11,140.43.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq was also the outperformer for the week, posting a 0.55% gain and its third positive week in a row. The Dow finished the week lower by 2.70%, and the S&amp;P posted a 0.66% loss, both breaking two-week win streaks.
*****
&gt; All of the major averages are still in positive territory for the year.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre having a more emotional reaction that expected,‚Äù said Jeff Kilburg, founder and CEO of KKM Financial. ‚ÄúA lot of people got so pessimistic and we saw parabolic moves to kick off the year. Now, as expected, the markets aren‚Äôt going in a straight line.‚Äù
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe are finding a way to continue to move and have higher lows,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThe higher lows put a little bit of confidence in the bulls. However, the technicals are still favoring the bears and selling rallies.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Investors continued to monitor earnings reports and mega cap tech shares led the market higher. Netflix gained about 8.5% after posting more subscribers than expected even though its quarterly earnings missed analysts‚Äô estimates. Alphabet rose more than 5% after the company announced it will lay off 12,000 employees.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seeing more weight go into some of the beat-up technology and because people are becoming a little bit more thoughtful of opportunity in the absolute tech wreck we saw in 2022,‚Äù Kilburg said.

&gt; # Staying Classy: Market Breadth, Buying Thrusts, and Brian Fantana

&gt; ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve done studies, you know. 60% of the time, it works every time.‚Äù -Brian Fantana (a.k.a. Paul Rudd) in Anchor Man

&gt; The big rally to start in 2023 is a welcome change from what we saw last year, but the extreme nature of the rally could be a significant clue that higher prices could be in the cards.

&gt; Walter Deemer (retired institutional market analyst) noted a ‚ÄúBreakaway Momentum‚Äù (BAM) thrust took place last week. This rare event happens after the total 10-day NYSE advancers to decliners is higher than 1.97. In other words, very strong market breadth over ten days. A day or two of strong breadth is normal, but to see it persist for ten days is a clue that something is happening, and we should pay close attention. Market breadth is simply how many stocks are going up versus down, suggesting a good deal of buying is happening underneath the surface.

&gt; According to Walter, there have been 24 of these events since 1949, and the S&amp;P 500 was up a year later 23 times and up 20.7% on average. The only time it didn‚Äôt work was a year after a signal in January 1987.

&gt; With help from our friends at Ned Davis Research, I looked at the data and took things further. The recent total 10-day NYSE advance to decline came in at 2.16, so I looked at all the times it was above 2.10 versus the 1.97 that Walter used. In other words, even stronger breadth.

&gt; Doing this showed 14 previous instances (the one last week was number 15). Once again, the future returns appear solid, higher a year later 13 times but up six months later every single time. I‚Äôll say that again, six months later, stocks have never been lower after this signal and were historically up nearly 16%. That would be a first-half rally that virtually no one is expecting.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/blog-144-800x338.png))**

&gt; Here‚Äôs a breakdown of all the previous buying thrusts, again only the year after the January 1987 signal was in the red. Up more than 20% on average, a higher 94.9% of the time a year later, is something the bulls shouldn‚Äôt ignore here.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/blog-278-800x624.png))**

&gt; This is just one bullet point, and as the great field reporter Brian Fantana told us, studies with high success percentages might sound good in theory, but they don‚Äôt always work out.

&gt; The good news is that we‚Äôve seen many other examples lately that suggest a change in trend has occurred, and the potential for higher prices could be coming. As I noted in ‚ÄúWhat Happens When Everyone Agrees That Stocks Will Fall?,‚Äù most investors expect a rough first half of 2023 and better second half. This is another clue that the masses could be wrong (just as they‚Äôve been throughout history), and a surprise early 2023 rally could be firmly in the cards.

***** 

&gt; # Bulls and Bears Almost Evenly Split

&gt; As we noted in last night's Closer, the S&amp;P 500 has seen a bit of technical damage done in the past few sessions. In spite of the turn lower, sentiment readings have improved. For the AAII sentiment survey, bullish sentiment has risen up to 31%. That 7 percentage point jump makes for the largest week-over-week increase and the highest reading since the week of November 17th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011923-Sent-1.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment plummeted to 33.1% of respondents which is down sharply from just a month ago when more than half of those responding reported as pessimists. The four straight weeks of declines is now the longest such streak since August leaving bearish sentiment only 0.2 percentage points above the second half of 2022's low reached in the first week of November.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011923-Sent-2.png))**

&gt; As a result of the big moves, the bull-bear spread has narrowed all the way to -2.1. As we have frequently noted over the past few months, we are currently on a record streak of 42 weeks in a row with a negative bull-bear spread. This week's reading is now the narrowest reading in the spread during that streak.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011923-Sent-3.png))**

&gt; Taking into account other sentiment surveys, this week's readings also showed a healthy improvement in sentiment, putting a record streak on the ropes. Below, we show our sentiment composite combining the AAII bull-bear spread with that same spread from the Investors Intelligence survey as well as the NAAIM Exposure index. At the moment, sentiment is only slightly more bearish than the historical norm with the composite at -0.14. While that does extend the streak of negative readings to 54 weeks in a row (tying an identically long streak that ended in June 2009), it is one of the least pessimistic readings of the current streak. In other words, across surveys sentiment may not have turned bullish, but it appears to be much less bearish than at other points in the past year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011923-Sent-5.png))**

*****

&gt; # Claims Peak Early

&gt; Jobless claims were anticipated to reverse much of last week's improvement as forecasts were calling for initial claims to rise from 205K to 214K. Instead, there was a sub-200K print as claims fell to the lowest level since the end of September.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011923-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; Before seasonal adjustments, claims fell to 285.58K from a seasonal peak of 339.16K last week. As shown below, a decline in the second week of the year is not unheard of but is not exactly the norm either. In most years, the second week of the year has marked the annual high for claims as the week has historically seen a week-over-week increase in claims 85% of the time. 2017 and 2018 are the two other most recent examples of claims peaking in the first rather than the second week of the year.

&gt; All that is to say, the week-over-week drop in the seasonally adjusted number per today's print is perhaps a bit overstated. The end and start of the year tend to be volatile for seasonality thus the weeks ahead will help to provide a clearer picture of where claims really stand.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011923-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Turning over to continuing claims, the first week of the year saw claims rise by 17K up to 1.647 million. That is still below higher levels observed throughout late November and December as the deterioration in claims over the past month has subsided.

&gt; # After Bear Market January Indicator Trifecta Amazing

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0b59794a432f735b25f144a754e2bfc7/be71515d02997b90-c6/s500x750/59988e6711df3855b32fc080b2da84f0261ac840.jpg))**

&gt; When there has been a bear market in the prior year and our January Indicator Trifecta is 3-for-3 positive it‚Äôs super bullish for the year. January is off to a great start with the Trifecta 2-for-2 so far with our Santa Claus Rally (2023 STA, page 118) and the First 5 Days (2023 STA, page 16) logging S&amp;P 500 gains. Keep your eye on our January Barometer (2023 STA, page 18)!

&gt; Using the Ned Davis Research bull and bear market definitions there were thirteen years since 1949 with bear market bottoms preceding a positive January Indicator Trifecta. The full year has never been down with double-digit gains every year, up 22.1% on average. The next 11 months have also never been down, up 16.8% on average.

&gt; The December Low Indicator (2023 STA, page 36) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow‚Äôs December Closing Low of 32757.54 on 12/19/2022.

&gt; We invented our January Indicator Trifecta in 2013 by combining our Santa Claus Rally and January Barometer, both invented by our late-founder Yale Hirsch in 1972 published in the 1973 Almanac, with the age-old First Five Days Early Warning System.

&gt; The market is on the cusp of confirming the bull market we believe we are in and our bullish 2023 annual forecast we made on December 22. S&amp;P 500 is flirting with clearing the downtrend line and the 200-day moving average. Next important levels are the December and August highs around 4100 and 4300.

&gt; # Is the Surge in Purchases and Refis Believable?

&gt; Early this morning, the weekly release of mortgage purchases and refinance applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association posted outright impressive week-over-week increases for both metrics. Beginning with a look at purchases, the reading surged almost 25% week over week for the highest reading in the index since 9/23. Even though that was a massive move higher, the purchases index remains at the low end of the past several year's range and would be only slightly better than those readings observed in the spring of 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011823-MBA-1.png))**

&gt; Refinance applications have been at some of the lowest levels in more than 20 years, and that continues to be the case even after rising well over 30% versus last week. Similar to purchases, that massive increase only brings refis back up to levels last seen in September.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011823-MBA-2.png))**

&gt; While a portion of those large improvements could potentially be the result of mortgage rates dropping to some of the lowest levels in the past few months, seasonality appears to be another and more plausible factor. Likely as a result of backlogs built up during the holidays, the second week of the year has plenty of precedent for outlier-like jumps in applications. As shown below, multiple times since the early 1990s the second week of the year has seen mortgage and refinance applications rise by at least 20% and 30% week over week, respectively. In other words, even if the surge in mortgage applications is eye-catching, we would caution against jumping to the conclusion that these increases are material without further follow-through in the weeks to come.

1210,StockMarket,"Starting December 21st, 2022, I had 1800$ to play around with. I was dabbling in call options with $TQQQ &amp; $SQQQ. The expiration dates were typically 1 to 2 weeks out. I grossed 12 grand (600%) over a course of 2 weeks. Making about 3-4 trades per week.

What I did:
-Get in early, typically taking the opposite trend (if TQQQ was positive for the morning, I would take SQQQ after the calls were down a significant amount)
-I either sold within an hour, end of day or the next day. Typically selling 15% or higher.

So there was no true method, just feel haha‚Ä¶ but then it happened, I held one option for three days -60 (two days before expiration, which I typically sell 3-4 days before exp and only hold at max 1 day), then went all down hill because I‚Äôm stupid and started doing risky options to regain my profits. 

Pure luck or could there be something there?","Sooo, do I have a method or no, probably not?",1674263344

1212,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**:  While a nice pop today, the move higher occurred entirely within the down move we've seen over the last 2x days.  The higher volume is likely due to option's expiration, as oppose to institutional momemtum behind the bulls.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY:** Price bounced off that support at flag's top, and stopped right at the 200 DMA.  Major resistance is 400 bear channel ceiling; the gap-fill is no longer a resistance level because thar gap filled earlier in the week.  Major resistance is flag's top, and if weakened from getting tagged yesterday than 384.22 ascending TL is major support.

**QQQ:** Price bounced off that ascending TL &amp; flag's top.  Major resistance at 286.51 gap-fill and that bear channel ceiling.  Major support is still that 274.78 flag's top and ascending TL convergence.

https://preview.redd.it/icrh3r4oiada1.jpg?width=2309&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fbf202c06ad5496cb05a2535884e1fed8c0e9be6

**IWM**: Price popped back above the channel ceiling before heading below 180.78; therefore that descending TL is back to being an official support level (albeit minor, unless price can remain above for it to 'harden').  Major resistance is 189.56 pivot high.  Major support is around 177 ascending TL from late December.

**Add Size**: 1%  
**New Avg**: 10.74  
New **Size**: 2%  
**Thesis**: UNG pierced its next major resistance level.  Given that we are at incredibly low price points, I am happy to continue adding tranches to this position; my next target is 9.00 and I will add up to 2% at this level.  My first target is the 20 DMA, but I will likely only exit half of the position and hold the remainder for a more significant move higher, potentially to 18.28 which would complete a M-A pattern.

&amp;#x200B;

**I did not execute 2x trades today.**

I missed my chance to exit RIOT today, as I mentioned potentially doing yesterday.  As discussed, BTC did 'break out' of its 6x day bull flag formation.  Interestingly, the break out in BTC did not cause RIOT to negate the topping tail it put in on January 13th.  If the breakout in BTC continues over the weekend, as we saw happen last weekend, I will look to add another 0.5% - 1% to my position between RIOT's 200 DMA (6.89) or resistance level (7.25).

I did not unload my NFLX Feb23 $315 puts from my earnings play.  My average is $19.90 with 0.5% of my portfolio.  They are currently selling at $5.55 ( - 72.1%).  I am going to see if NFLX can hit $350 on Monday or Tuesday, and if it can, I may add 1% to this position.  If NFLX hitting $350 brings the contract price to around $5, I could drop my average to $10...and if NFLX price pulls back sharply off $350 (major resistance at gap-fill from their April 2022 earnings call), I may recoup my losses, or even turn this trade around depending on the pullback.

Although these investments come with risk, the return profile has proven to asymmetrically skew towards the upside, due to the face that their growth potential is so high. However, they are already successful since they are due to become public in the near future, so they aren't as risky as early-stage startups.

1228,StockMarket,"Ark Invest‚Äôs Cathie Wood said her conviction in Tesla remains strong as ever as she kept buying the dip in the electric vehicle company.

‚ÄúJust from electric vehicles there could be... it is almost a fivefold increase in this stock during the next five years,‚Äù Wood said during an investor webinar on Thursday. ‚ÄúAnd if you believe autonomous at all, it‚Äôs closer to 13 times during the next five years. So we are as bullish about Tesla as we have ever been.‚Äù

Wood previously predicted that the shift to electric vehicles will be drastic, resulting in 60 million EVs sold in five years. The innovation investor has been a longtime Tesla bull, seeing shares hitting a split-adjusted level above $1,500 by 2026. Shares of Tesla are up about 3% this year, ending Thursday‚Äôs session at $127.17.

Elon Musk‚Äôs company has experienced a slew of bad news as of late. Tesla‚Äôs December sales of China-made cars fell to the lowest level in five months amid the country‚Äôs Covid outbreak. Musk‚Äôs rocky $44 billion¬†Twitter¬†takeover might have also contributed to the decline as he sold tens of billions of dollars of his Tesla shares last year to help finance the buyout.

‚ÄúTesla moved down in the fourth quarter, had a dramatic rerating as the capitulation in the growth strategies was highlighted,‚Äù Wood said. ‚ÄúThe disappointments in China were well telegraphed.‚Äù

Tesla dropped 53% in the fourth quarter, bringing its 2022 losses to 65%.

The widely followed fund manager has been buying the beaten down carmaker for a few months during the sell-off. Wood revealed Thursday that she took some profits in Exact Sciences and put much of those profits into Tesla.

Tesla has made big price cuts on its vehicles, first in China and then, on Jan. 13, in the U.S. and Europe. Wood said the aggressive price reductions will help the company stay competitive.

‚ÄúTesla is going to be very aggressive in pricing,‚Äù Wood said. ‚ÄúTesla can afford to do this. It‚Äôs got the lowest cost structure and is innovating we believe the most aggressively. The other auto manufacturers are going to compete. They‚Äôll have to follow these price declines, but it will hurt them from a margin at a profitability point of view quite significantly.‚Äù

1229,StockMarket,"Hello everyone!  So I am a Euro person who has mostly been investing in Europe. Nothing special, mostly ETFs.

I want to know move to stocks, and I am considering US stocks. 

I never understood how I can protect myself against the EUR/USD fluctuation, but today, I found that multiple US stocks are listed in European Markets in Euros.

Just to give a concrete example:

  **NDQ¬†| MSFT¬†| US5949181045 - Microsoft listed in Nasdaq.**

1.  **I don't understand why there are US stocks in Euros in the European Markets?** 

2. **Does this also means that I would be protected from the EUR/USD fluctuation? (I don't think so, but I cannot explain why, all this sounds too good to be true)**

1233,StockMarket,"Hi guys! Do you know ICHIMOKU CLOUDS? 

It is perhaps the most reliable and complete technical analysis tool that exists. Let's see together how it works by applying it to **WETG stock.**

The **Ichimoku Cloud** is a technical indicator primarily used by traders and analysts to define support and resistance levels.Also known as the ‚ÄòIchimoku Kinko Hyo‚Äô indicator, which translates into a ‚Äúone look equilibrium chart‚Äù, Ichimoku may look complicated, but is easy to use.

Here, we provide a brief breakdown of these four components:

* The **Tenkan Sen** (conversion line) is calculated by the sum of the highest high and the lowest low divided by two. The default setting is 9 periods.
* The **Kijun Sen** (standard or base line) is based on the same formula as the Tenkan Sen, but the default here is 26 periods.
* The **Chikou Span** (lagging span) represents the current closing price time shifted backwards 26 periods
* The **Kumo** (cloud) consists of two lines - the Senkou spans A and B. The former one is calculated by the adding Tenkan Sen and Kijun Sen and then divided by two, shifted forwards 26 periods. The latter represents the highest high + lowest low)/2 for the last 52 periods, also shifted 26 periods in the future.

¬†WETG example, 5h time frame with Ichimoku

[https://it.investing.com/portfolio/?portfolioID=Ym9hMW8%2FYz0%2Fbjs1YDM%3D](https://it.investing.com/portfolio/?portfolioID=Ym9hMW8%2FYz0%2Fbjs1YDM%3D)

Trading signals generated by Ichimoku In this segment we will explain how to use the Ichimoku Cloud. Generally speaking, the indicator is better fit for longer time frames.  


Kumo is arguably the most important element of the Ichimoku Cloud. It is designed in such a way that if the asset‚Äôs price trades below the Cloud, the indicators signal that we are trading in a downtrend and vice versa. A break in the Cloud is seen as a signal to enter a trade, since this is a confirmation that the market trades in an uptrend/downtrend.  


The most important functions of the Ichimoku indicator is to identify trend direction and generate trading signals.  


As you will see, Kumo also changes colours based on the trend direction. Whenever the Senkou Span A rises above the Senkou Span B, the idea that the market trades in an uptrend is further strengthened.  


Besides Kumo, the second situation that traders monitor is the relationship between Tenkan and Kijun. Here, the former is seen as a short-term moving average, while the Kijun acts as the baseline.  


In this regard, any situation where Tenkan moves below Kijun signals a downtrend in the price action, and vice versa. In order to further validate the trade signal, you may want to consult Kumo and see whether it is generating the same signal.  


Finally, the third situation involves the position of Chikou Span on a chart. If Chikou trades above the price action, it would confirm bullish sentiment; if below, vice versa. A clean trading signal is generated once all three situations point towards the same trend - bullish or bearish.

Beware of this: 

[https://it.investing.com/portfolio/?portfolioID=Ym9hMW8%2FYz0%2Fbjs1YDM%3D](https://it.investing.com/portfolio/?portfolioID=Ym9hMW8%2FYz0%2Fbjs1YDM%3D)

**The long lateralization of the cloud for the WETG stock with the two almost parallel lines lead us to think that the prices will be able to cut this trend from the bottom up, thus starting a new bullish phase.**

1244,StockMarket," Good morning and Happy Friday! Markets have been quite wild recently, with a significant amount of general momentum. I hope you all have a weekend and have a successful day trading today!   


With the markets moving extremely irrationally over the previous couple of days, there have been many opportunities to be able to capitalize on and realize some gains. Keep seizing the opportunities available to you and make the most out of everything.  

 Look into selling some 0-DTE CSPs to capitalize on the opportunities that are available and make a small amount of bank in the process.   


I would not recommend over-trading today as I am expecting a significant amount of chop. Just like they say about riptides, even if you are a good swimmer, you are at risk of drowning. The same goes for here in the markets. When things are choppy and you are over-trading, there is an extremely high chance for you to lose a significant amount with ease.

#[Stock futures rise after Dow goes negative for the year](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/19/stock-futures-tick-up-after-dow-goes-negative-for-the-year.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were higher on Friday as investors tried to hang onto the January rally amid worries about monetary policy and slowing earnings.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 14 points, or less than 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Google rose 3% after the company announced it will lay off 12,000 employees. Netflix jumped 5% after posting more subscribers than expected even though its quarterly earnings missed analysts‚Äô estimates.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off another down session, with the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 posting three-day losing streaks as corporate earnings and economic data signal a slowing economy. The Dow slipped more than 252 points, or 0.76% and is now down 0.31% year to date. The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.76% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.96%, but both indexes are positive for the year.
*****
&gt; For the week, all three indexes are on track to close lower. The Dow is down 3.67%, on track for its worst week since September. The S&amp;P 500 is down more than 2.5% and could notch its worst weekly performance since December. The Nasdaq is down more than 2% and on pace to break a two-week win streak.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe market is focused and is not sure how to react between the backward looking Fed analysis of the market versus the forward and leading indicators of the market,‚Äù said Tim Seymour, founder and chief investment officer of Seymour Asset Management, on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúFast Money.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Those forward indicators include economic data such as retail sales and industrial production. ‚ÄúThis is where the market is starting to break down,‚Äù he said.
*****
&gt; Going forward, investors will continue to watch corporate earnings with oilfield services name SLB and Ally Financial set to report Friday. They will also listen closely to speeches from Fed officials ahead of the central bank‚Äôs February meeting, seeking clues on the size of the rate hike that‚Äôs likely forthcoming.

1272,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**:  Really interesting price action from a technical perspective, as resistance &amp; support levels played out beautifully across all the majors.  With each index sitting at-or-near the support levels which resulted from their recent breakouts, we may 'pause' or consolidate for a day or so until the major earnings reports come into play in the coming weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY:** Price played out perfectly from a technical perspective.  Tuesday &amp; Wednesday pierced the gap-fill and then nearly tagged the bear channel ceiling...followed by a clear reversal.  As discussed, the bear flag's top did act as a major support level today; we will see if it can hold tomorrow.  If not, there is another support level at 383.88 ascending TL which led to the breakouts last week.  The next major support level is 374.77 pivot low.  If price heads back higher, then the bear channel celing TL is a clear, major resistance level.

https://preview.redd.it/8k0sltrlz3da1.jpg?width=2314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=50d21d6bf3963754d657369b53b62993f7fd470b

**QQQ:** Tech never did reach those key technical levels before reversing.  As discussed previously, that ascending TL did act as a support level following the breakout through it last week.  I could see price consolidating between this major support level &amp; the similarly major resistance level at bear channel ceiling until we hit the major tech earning reports in the coming week.  If this major support does not hold, then 259.08 pivot low is the next major support area. 

https://preview.redd.it/rafl6sqny3da1.jpg?width=2309&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=929b17f02a1fe122a3d38e081cc669fc8bf8dbd7

**IWM**: Price reversed just prior to reaching the November/December pivot highs (failed to reach the candle wicks, but did reach the candle bodies).  The close back inside the channel is a serious blow to the bulls; price must now close below 180.78 to make the channel ceiling a resistance level again.  The former gap-fill at 180.19 is minor support; first major support is 176.50 ascending TL.  If price manages to head back higher, then 189.56 is clearly a major resistance level.

**I executed 3x trades so far this week:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Type**: Sell to Close  
**Symbol**: TSLA  
**Return**: + 16.16%  
**Entry Date**:  12/21/2022  
**Avg Price**:  117.34  
**Exit Price**: 136.30  
**Thesis**: On Wednesday, price had shot through my $135 target in the AH/PM and into that pause area from December 21st, before flushing out over the course of the day.

https://preview.redd.it/ay4nsu5a14da1.jpg?width=2309&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=00ed9a6894d01d9f55886b7f48547f6b5875de20

&amp;#x200B;

**Type**: Short to Add  
**Symbol**: RIOT  
**Add Price**: 6.55  
**Add Size**: 0.5%  
**New Avg**: 6.17  
New **Size**: 1.5%  
**Thesis**: RIOT put in a topping tail on Friday, December 17th.  When BTC rocketed back to the pre-FTX collapse price of $21,000, I thought for sure that topping tail would get taken out &amp; I would be adding at 7.25 -- but that did not happen, with price closing just below the topping tail.  Therefore, when price retraced back towards Tuesday's daily high, I added to the position, but only 0.5% since I am still far below my next technical add at 7.25.  I was expecting a bigger pullback by now, but the BTC chart may be forming a bull flag, so if that bull flag remains in place tomorrow and the position is positive, I will likely close the position just as a defensive play.  If the bull flag breaks down, then I will hold the position for a pullback on RIOT to its 20 DMA.

&amp;#x200B;

**Type**: Earnings Play  
**Symbol**: NFLX Put Options  
**Price**: 19.90  
**Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**: Obviously with its earning's report out, this is most likely going to be a loser....but....here is what I was thinking, nonetheless.  Really impressive recovery from its April earnings report.  Into a major resistance level (gap-fill, albeit already filled &amp; tested once in December 2022).  I bought Feb17 $315 puts just before the closing bell.  Since it is currently trading at $338, I will likely take a loss here; my plan for tomorrow is to let the morning IV cool off and just see what happens.  I do not mind holding these puts for a few days to a week, but I will not hold these puts for more than a week unless price reverses very quickly.

1299,StockMarket,"Are consumers gravitating towards Netflix‚Äôs new ad-supported service? Shareholders are hoping the streamer sheds light on the new plan during its fourth-quarter earnings report, which is due after the bell Thursday.

Wall Street has kept a close eye on Netflix in recent quarters as it broke with its own tradition to offer up a lower-priced tier with advertisements and teased new strategies for cracking down on password sharing, all in an effort to boost revenue.

Here‚Äôs what Wall Street expects:

* **EPS:**¬†45 cents per share, according to Refinitiv.
* **Revenue:**¬†$7.85 billion, according to Refinitiv survey.
* **Expected global paid net subscribers:**¬†Addition of 4.57 million subscribers, according to StreetAccount estimates.

Last quarter, the streamer said it was ‚Äúvery optimistic‚Äù about its new advertising business. While it doesn‚Äôt expect the new tier will add a material contribution to its fourth-quarter results, it foresees membership growing gradually over time.

Heading into Thursday‚Äôs report, analysts are expecting the company to announce an additional 4.57 million paid subscribers, on pace with Netflix‚Äôs own projection of 4.5 million. The number would be stronger than the 2.4 million the service added in the previous quarter and significantly better than the declines it saw in the first half of the year.

1310,StockMarket,"Amerigo Resources (TSX: ARG) (OTCQX: ARREF) announced 2022 production results form Minera Valle Central (MVC), their 100% owned operation located near Rancagua, Chile.

In 2022, MVC produced 64 million pounds of copper, with 59% of production coming from fresh tailings. Annual copper production was 3.4% above guidance of 61.9M lbs, due to higher grade and recoveries from fresh tailing and higher grade from historical tailings (Cauquenes tailings).

Amerigo‚Äôs 2022 cash cost was $1.98 per pound (‚Äú/lb‚Äù), including $0.04/lb paid to MVC‚Äôs workers in Q4-2022 as the signing bonus of a 3-year collective labor agreement. Normalized cash costs excluding the effect of the signing bonus was $1.94/lb, only 2% higher than 2022 cash cost guidance of $1.90/lb.

&amp;#x200B;

**Guidance &amp; Copper Prices**

MVC continues to produce over guidance year after year ‚Äì a good sign for investors and a testament to the operational capabilities of management. Amerigo expects to produce 62.3M lbs of copper and 1.0M lbs of molybdenum, in line with 2022 guidance of 61.9 M lbs.

More importantly Amerigo‚Äôs indicated copper price was $3.80/lb in Q4, compared to $3.50/lb in Q3. However, Amerigo is ultimately paid based on the January/February/March copper price. Copper is averaging around $4.40/lb YTD in 2023, which is 16% above the number given in the earnings release. Every 10% increase in copper prices is $5.7M of extra revenue, as the company stated in Q3.

In Q4-2022, Amerigo returned $3.7 million to shareholders through the regular quarterly dividend of Cdn$0.03 per share and made bank debt repayments of $3.5 million in principal.

On December 31, 2022, cash was $37.8 million (a reduction of $4.0 million from September 30, 2022), restricted cash was $4.2 million (a reduction of $2.2 million from September 30, 2022) and outstanding bank debt was $24.5 million (a decrease of $3.5 million from September 30, 2022).

&amp;#x200B;

**Cash Costs Guidance for 2023**

Higher power charges from the Chilean power grid will increase expected cash costs this year, contribution $0.06/lb to the 2023 guidance of $2.14/lb. This compares to cash costs of $1.94/lb in 2022.

The attributed cash costs affect all industrial consumers in the country and represent ongoing global inflation for energy and many industrial consumables. The 2023 guidance assumes an average copper price of $3.60/lb and an average molybdenum price of $16/lb; based on an exchange rate of $920 Chilean pesos to $1USD.

The company wisely factored in annual plant maintenance into their production guidance. There will be an annual 9-day plant maintenance shutdown at MVC and El Teniente in the second half of 2023.

Projected 2023 EBITDA is expected to be $33.8 million (excluding the effect of 2022 settlement adjustments). Each $0.10/lb increase in copper price up to $4/lb would have an impact on EBITDA of $2.0 million. Each $0.10/lb increase in copper price over $4/lb would have an increase in EBITDA of approximately $2.7 million.

In 2023, MVC is expected to incur the following capital expenditures on projects (‚ÄúCapex‚Äù):

Amerigo is confident they will continue their attractive capital return strategy, due to a healthy cash balance, minimal debt and strong free cashflow. Since the implementation of the dividend in 2021, the company has paid a cumulative dividend of $0.14 per share, or $18.6 million. The company also used $21.1 million to buy and cancel 17.87 million of its common shares, a 9.82% reduction in common shares outstanding.

Under the 2023 guidance assumptions presented in this news release, the Company remains confident in the security of the quarterly Cdn$0.03 per share dividend, and in Amerigo‚Äôs ability to opportunistically reduce common shares outstanding.

Under the current Normal Course Issuer Bid (‚ÄúNCIB‚Äù), up to 10.75 million shares (representing 6.14% of the issued and outstanding) can be repurchased for cancellation prior to December 1, 2023.

In addition to quarterly dividends of Cdn$0.03 per share and the repurchase of common shares for cancellation under the NCIB, the Company has indicated that it will likely look to pay additional performance-based dividends in 2023.",Amerigo: 2022 Production Results Above Guidance &amp; Provides 2023 Guidance,1674144275

1312,StockMarket,"Vanadium is a key strategic metal essential to the energy transition. It increases the strength and efficiency of industrial metals and is also the main element in the manufacture of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs).  There's long-term growth potential of the VRFB market as a green technology with lots of upside.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2023, there are several additional factors to consider in the development of the VRFB market and overall vanadium demand outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vanadium Demand Drivers**

The steel industry accounted for 92% of total vanadium demand in 2021 and remains the key source of demand.  It is expected to continue to lead demand, with China demand for steel showing no signs of slowing while making up 60% of vanadium consumption globally.  Wood Mackenzie forecasts that vanadium demand in the steel market will grow at a CAGR of about 3.1 percent until 2030.

For a 2 minute video summary look here:

**Vanadium Prices On the Move Again, Is it a Signal?**

In the first half of 2022 V2O5 prices (Vanadium Pentoxide) reached a high of US$ 13 per pound, driven by concerns over potential supply disruptions from the Ukraine/Russian conflict, but lowered over demand concerns from China with steel production slowdowns in preparation for the Winter Games as well as lockdowns due to the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Prices declines in the second half as economic growth concerns grabbed headlines, but in late 2022 and into the new year, Vanadium prices are showing signs of life, hitting around $9.80 per pound, approx. 26% above the lows of 2022.

https://preview.redd.it/bbczsnlio0da1.png?width=687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d3d92b9bdd7ae602f0732d7f15d2265e5483c55b

The price increases are likely driven by two factors:

1) A rebound in demand from the Aerospace industry as COVID lockdowns recede and international travel picks up. Aerospace grade vanadium is of the highest purity and only provided by specialized processors.

2) The installation and interconnection of the world‚Äôs largest VRFB battery project China recently. Industrial demand for VRFB batteries is picking up steam and are expected have a significant impact on demand for Vanadium in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

**Large Scale VRFB Installations: A New Driver of Demand**

The word‚Äôs largest non-lithium or pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) project was commissioned recently in China and has set off a wave of ever larger projects across the world. In September of last year, Dalian Rongke Power, in partnership with Pangang Group Vanadium/Titanium Resources installed a 100MW/400MWh Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB) system in Dalian, China.

[https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/29/china-connects-worlds-largest-redox-flow-battery-system-to-grid/](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/29/china-connects-worlds-largest-redox-flow-battery-system-to-grid/)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cjwc4t3wo0da1.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=75ba374f47930947e6f95a0e86e5b0201820f3be

The system was developed with Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics and will eventually scale to over 200MW/800MWh, making it the largest VRFB system in the world to date. To put this battery system into perspective, it required \~4% of total annual global vanadium production (\~8,000 tonnes of V2O5).

China has plans to build another 1,000 GW of solar and wind capacity by 2030 and as VRFB batteries demonstrate their effectiveness in long duration applications, there is a large opportunity for them to fill some of the energy storage needs generated by all the new wind and solar capacity.

The Pangang VRFB system is in Dalian City‚Äôs Shahekou District, which is in Liaoning Province in northeastern China.  The system has the potential to lower the peak load on the local grid and improve the reliability of the overall power supply in the entire province, enhancing the opportunity to connect new generation sources (like renewable) energy to the grid.

The Dalian project is part of a multi-year Chinese plan for the nation to transition to lower-energy consumption, stimulate demand for renewable energy and energy storage products and achieve net zero emissions by 2060.

VRFBs are a relatively newer energy storage technology to reach commercial viability, creating a demand for the green metal beyond traditional uses.

https://preview.redd.it/1l4efvo2p0da1.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bc005b8493170185d941f1b3dc4076ad53c7c2e6

According to S&amp;P Global, new stationary storage deployments may hit approximately 100 GWh/year by 2027, while the World Bank had said vanadium was among the top five metals affected by the energy transition, with 189% of current vanadium production needed globally by 2050 to support the energy transition alone.

There are 3 global leaders in primary production for vanadium: Largo Inc. (TSX: LGO) (NASDAQ: LGO) which has a mine in Brazil; Bushveld Minerals (LSE: BMN), which has mines in South Africa and mining giant Glencore (LSE: GLEN), also in South Africa.  Largo Inc. owns the largest producing primary Vanadium mine in the world and is more of a pure play on Vanadium while Bushveld and Glencore have exposure to the metal but are more diversified.

Primary production is where vanadium is produced as the primary product directly from processing vanadium bearing magnetite ores.  Co-production is where vanadium-rich slag is produced during steelmaking or pig-iron production.

Co-production at 73 percent is the most significant global source of supply. 70 percent of annual vanadium supply is produced via the method of co-production in China and Russia ‚Äì which are largely influenced by steel and iron prices and not by the vanadium market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Market Share &amp; Production**

Two of these vanadium companies ‚Äì Largo and Bushveld are involved in the manufacture of VRFBs.  If one or both companies gain a combined 10% share of the stationary storage market, global vanadium production will increase by 50%.

As an example, let‚Äôs look at Bushveld Minerals production results.  Bushveld Minerals owns two of the four world‚Äôs operating primary vanadium processing facilities.  They produced about 3,600 metric tonnes of vanadium in 2021, constituting about 3% of global vanadium production with plans to grow their production by 40% to 50% next year.  If funding and the appropriate market conditions prevail, they will increase their output to up to 8,000 tonnes per year.

Largo Inc. as a vanadium producer, is highly leveraged to vanadium spot prices and is well positioned in an environment with increasing demand for the green metal. According to its latest published NI 43-101 technical report, Largo has plans to increase its vanadium production from 11,500 tonnes to 15,900 tonnes by 2031, representing a 40% increase\[i\]. This of course is subject to a multitude of variables but represents its ability to expand production to meet increasing demand ‚Äì essentially making it one of the faster alternatives to new supply. For instance, Largo is the last primary vanadium operation to come online in the last 30 years.

Largo is also one of the largest providers of the high purity vanadium used in the aerospace industry, which generates some of the highest margins of any vanadium product.

For more details on Largo‚Äôs growth plans please see our deep dive on the company and the overall vanadium market here:

&amp;#x200B;

**2023 is Shaping up to be a Compelling year for Vanadium**

Vanadium demand is being revolutionized before our eyes and early success of VRFB projects in China are driving a step change in demand for the battery metal.

Recent Vanadium price increases signal that large battery storage projects are having an impact on the market. We think investors should watch the success of projects in China closely as they will likely spur further increases in vanadium prices in the months to come.

The vanadium market is still very illiquid with big, multi-year contracts dominating. Small increases to demand have historically always led to spikes in price. This time isn‚Äôt likely to be any different.

1315,StockMarket," 

Blackrock and Goldman Sachs are two of the biggest names in finance, and their recent comments on the state of the global economy are worth paying attention to.

Let's dive in in their 2023 plans.

In 2023, global growth is expected to remain weak, according to Goldman Sachs. The US economy is predicted to narrowly avoid a recession, with core PCE inflation slowing from its current level of 5% to 3% by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Blackrock predicts that interest rates will stop rising and economic activity will stabilize in 2023.

This new economic cycle is being driven by constraints on production. The shift in consumer spending from services to goods during the pandemic caused shortages and bottlenecks. Population aging also led to a labor shortage. As a result, developed countries are unable to produce as much as they used to without increasing inflation. Despite the fact that economic activity is below its pre-Covid levels, inflation is still very high.

Central bank policy rates are not the tool to resolve production constraints; they can only influence demand in their economies. This leaves them with a difficult trade-off. They can either get inflation back to 2% targets by reducing demand to what the economy can comfortably produce now, or they can live with more inflation.

Right now, the **Federal Reserve** is **focused** on **avoiding a recession**. Although there are already **signs** of an **economic downturn**, **Blackrock** **expects** the **Fed** to **stop** **raising interest rates** once the **damage becomes clear.** As spending returns to normal, some production constraints may ease. However, **three long-term** **trends** are predicted to continue to limit production capacity and solidify the new economic system. **These are aging populations causing workforce shortages, ongoing geopolitical tensions disrupting supply chains and globalization, and the transition to net-zero carbon**

**Venturing into Unknown Economic Territory**

**Blackrock and Goldman Sachs are convinced that the current economic cycle will be distinct from previous ones. This new economic cycle is ongoing and cannot be halted.**

One key characteristic of this new economic cycle is that we are living in a supply-driven world with tough trade-offs. Repeated inflation surprises have sent bond yields soaring, crushing equities and fixed income. **This volatility stands in sharp contrast to the last 40 years of steady growth and inflation.**

In this **new economic cycle**, central banks are not expected to come to the rescue when growth slows. **Instead, they are deliberately causing recessions by implementing overly tight monetary policies in an effort to control inflation.**

According to Goldman Sachs, this economic cycle is unique because the recent normalization of supply chains and the rental housing market is causing disinflation, which was not seen in previous high-inflation episodes such as the 1970s. This is just starting to be reflected in official numbers. The shift in consumer spending from goods to services, the improvement of supply chains, and the increase in inventory levels are all putting downward pressure on core goods prices. Asking rents for new leases have also decreased after the spike in demand for space caused by the work-from-home trend. This suggests that the official measure of shelter inflation has likely peaked and will slow in the future.

New Economic Cycle Requires New Investment Strategies

According to Blackrock, the key factor in their investment strategy is the amount of economic damage that has been accounted for in market prices. As such, their first investment theme for 2023 is damage pricing. They believe that current equity valuations do not fully reflect the potential damage and will become more positive on equities when they think the damage has been priced in or when their view of market risk changes. However, **Blackrock does not expect this to** **mark the beginning of another long bull market in stocks and bonds like the one we had in the last decade.**

**To succeed in the new economic cycle, investors will need to update their investment strategy**. This will involve making **more frequent changes to their portfolios by carefully considering their risk appetite and their estimates of how markets are accounting for economic damage.** It will also **involve taking a more detailed, granular approach to investment,** **focusing on specific sectors, regions, and sub-asset classes rather than broad exposures.**

**In the short term, Blackrock believes that treasury bonds and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) offer good opportunities**. They will keep a lot of inflation-linked bonds because they expect inflation to last longer than market prices suggest. **In the long term, Blackrock will remain underweight as long as long-term government bonds continue to face challenges**. In terms of stocks, **Blackrock believes that the potential recession is not fully reflected in corporate profits estimates or values**, and does not agree with market expectations that central banks will eventually become supportive by cutting interest rates.

To add more detail while staying underweight overall, **Blackrock is focusing on sectoral opportunities resulting from structural changes, such as healthcare for aging populations**. They also like cyclical in the **energy** and **banking sectors**. Earnings in the **energy sector** are stable even as they decline from historically high levels due to **limited energy supply**. Higher interest rates are good for **bank profits.**

**While reading outlooks for 2023 from investment funds can sometimes be confusing and contradictory, we must agree that the market is not the same as it once was. New economic cycles are emerging, and the aging populations in Europe and the United States are contributing to higher inflation due to a lack of sufficient workforce. It is clear that a new investment strategy is needed to navigate this changing landscape.**",Blackrock and Goldman Sachs - 2023 preview,1674138201

# [Dow futures fall more than 250 points as Wall Street gets set for another down session](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/18/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures traded lower Thursday, building on the losses from the previous session, as rate and recession fears dented market sentiment.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 277 points, or 0.8%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures shed 0.8% and 1%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a losing session. The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 1.56% on Wednesday for its worst day since Dec. 15. The Dow shed more than 613 points, or 1.81%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.24%, snapping seven-straight days of gains. Bank stocks such as JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo slid, weighing on the broader market.
*****
&gt; Disappointing retail sales and a weaker-than-expected producer price index reading ignited recession fears, sending stocks lower.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, investors will weigh more economic data that could give further clues as how much the Fed may raise interest rates in its upcoming meeting. Initial jobless claims, housing starts and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve‚Äôs manufacturing survey will be released in the morning. Several central bank leaders including Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard will also speak throughout the day on the path forward.
*****
&gt; Investors have been parsing through the latest data and Fed remarks for clues on how high rates will go. But, while recent numbers point to easing inflation, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon thinks rates will top 5%.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a lot of underlying inflation, which won‚Äôt go away so quick,‚Äù Dimon told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box‚Äù from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
*****
&gt; Investors will also be watching key quarterly reports to see if there is an earnings recession brewing. Netflix and Truist Financial are among companies reporting earnings on Thursday.

Crypto mining stocks are soaring as bitcoin price rebounds to a new multi-month high above $21,000 after a prolonged bear market.

According to a Tuesday report by Bloomberg, several Bitcoin mining stocks have recorded their best monthly performance in at least a year.

 

As per the [report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-17/crypto-mining-stocks-eye-best-month-in-a-year-atop-bitcoin-jump#xj4y7vzkg), the MVIS Global Digital Assets Mining Index is up by 64% since the beginning of this month, a stark contrast to the 88% drop recorded last year. Bloomberg also pointed out that this is the Index‚Äôs best month since its launch at the end of 2021.

Bitfarms, one of the biggest Bitcoin mining firms in the industry, recorded an increase of more than 140% in the first two weeks of January. It is closely followed by Marathon Digital Holdings Inc., which has surged over 120%. Hive Blockchain Technologies Ltd. also saw the value of its stocks more than double during the same period.

The report further noted that the Luxor Hashprice Index is up 21% this year, which is partly a reflection of bigger rewards from a surge in bitcoin‚Äôs price. The Index seeks to estimate how much a miner can expect to earn from the computing power used for the Bitcoin network.

 The upward movement in Bitcoin stocks comes amid a broader market rally, which has added more than $100 billion to the crypto market‚Äôs total capitalization over the past two weeks.

From what we have seen so far, the interest rates, inflation rates, and mortgage rates are crazily high. although there are signs that it has peaked already, it would still take time till it comes down again.

&amp;#x200B;

In April 2020, GBT was forced to make the decision of changing the Company‚Äôs direction by developing a portfolio of intellectual property within the area of microchips technology and design\*). The years 2019 and 2020 were compounded with recuring legal issues and COVID-19 restrictions creating extremely difficult times and challenges. GBT focused on its core competency in the area of Research &amp; Development (‚ÄúR&amp;D‚Äù) creating an IP portfolio combined of patents, trade secrets and prototypes further defining GBT‚Äôs new mission.

&amp;#x200B;

GBT is now developing IP in areas which will leverage its competencies and experience with the goal of diversifying in various fast-growing semiconductor industries in today‚Äôs leading, growing market segments.

&amp;#x200B;

GBT currently holds 10 patents and has 25 submissions within in the following domains: tracking, 3-D Microchip Design (semiconductors), EDA Software Tools and subsets with, cyber security, ID, telehealth, AI, computer vision, IoT, mesh networks and sectors which it believes are in demand. The Company has been delivering a steady stream of new IPs for portfolio expansion developing new ideas and successful patents, over the past two years.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2020, GBT set a milestone goal of 25 patents by the end of 2023, and it exceeded the original timeline already. The following graph will visualize the progress GBT has made on the IP side.

Going forward, GBT will focus on expanding the families of various patents and concentrating on strategic potential partnerships with the goal of integrating these technologies into a broad marketplace, one that will potentially diversify the risk within these areas:

Build a portfolio pipeline of IP related to microchip technology.

Seek to actively introduce this new technology to strategic partners, large companies and VC‚Äôs creating market opportunities.

Using market diversification to create access to new fields and future growth.

1385,StockMarket,"More than one in three of the 535 senators and representatives in the U.S. Congress showed up to the new session with FTX baggage, having received campaign support from one of the senior executives of the fraud-ridden crypto giant.

CoinDesk has identified 196 members of the new Congress ‚Äì many of whom were just sworn in last week ‚Äì who took cash from Sam Bankman-Fried or other senior executives at FTX, a crypto exchange that filed for bankruptcy in Delaware in November after CoinDesk revealed unusually close ties between FTX and Alameda Research, an affiliated hedge fund. The names in Congress range from the heights of both chambers, including new Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), down to a list of recipients new to high-level politics.

After the lawmakers received the money, it became clear ‚Äì according to the work of journalists, the criminal charges and admissions of guilt from FTX insiders ‚Äì that the funds sprang from this colossal financial swindle. CoinDesk reached out to all 196 lawmakers to ask what they would do with the money.

Most of the politicians who responded said they handed it over to charities to remove the taint of contributions from executives such as former FTX CEO Bankman-Fried, whose federal fraud charges also include an accusation that he violated campaign-finance laws. Others have revealed they had conversations with the U.S. Department of Justice about setting aside the money until it can be dropped into a fund to compensate FTX victims.

1391,StockMarket,"Indo (Indonesian Energy corp) is a non government owned oil and gas company located in Indonesia. They have a market cap of around 50 million dollars.

* Indo according to yahoo finance are planning on producing as many as 18 barrels a day using their Kruh 26 well which they had previously,
* Two more oil wells, Kruh 27 and Kruh 28 were dug up and discovered in 2022 by the Indo group
* Moreover according to yahoo finance During drilling of Kruh 28, more than 28% hydrocarbon gas was recorded with composition up to C5 (an indication of the presence of liquid hydrocarbons), suggesting a potential new oil and gas bearing formation. Production from the Kruh 28 well is expected in the first quarter of 2023.
* Financials
* Their last two financial statements showed a negative net profit.
* However in March 2022 their negative income was of - 530 thousand dollars while in December 2021 their net profit was of - 1.58 million dollars, greater than their revenue of 2022.
* The revenue from March 2021 to March 2022 increased over 100% to 1.17 million dollars
* Indo has paid 0 in dividends in the past 12 months

Other competing companies financials,

BP ( British Petroleum)

* September 2022 net income - 2.16 billion dollars, revenue - 54.37 billion dollars
* Jun 2022 net income - 9.26 billion dollars. However in June of 2022 their net change in cash fell by over 100% to -1.31 billion dollars, Revenue of 67.24 billion dollars

Total

* Revenue of 68 billion dollars in September 2022, and a net income of 6.63 billion dollars.
* As of June 2022 they had a revenue of 70.44 billion dollars and a net income of 5.69 billion dollars.
* March 2022 total recorded a revenue of 63.95 billion dollars and a net income of 4.94 billion.
* Annual dividend of around 0.7 euros per share owned, right now trading at 60 euros a share.
   * Dividends handed out every 4 months.

In my opinion, Indo is not a good investment since they have not posted their latest quarterly financials, and for the quarterly financials they posted in June 2022 were the same ones they posted in March 2022. Unlike other oil and gas companies such as BP in England, or Total in France, their quarterly revenues published in June 2022, March 2022 and December 2021 have all recorded a negative net profit. furthermore the fact that Indo has paid 0 in dividends in the past 12 months which disincentives's investors to invest in Indo.

BP is a highly volatile company and could be a good investment however more risky then potentially Total, which is slightly less volatile than BP. In addition, since 2015 Total have only posted positive net profits. Moreover Total energies have been paying dividends even during its toughest Covid times, indicating that Total energies is a stable long term growing company.

# Global Markets Daily: Equity Implied Volatility Pricing a Soft Landing

* ***Equity Implied Vol has dropped off sharply already YTD; with IV across expiries &amp; indices resetting to levels near their lowest in the last year***
   * Volatility had been elevated relative to macro backdrop in recent months (per GS estimates) -&gt; that's no longer the case in options pricing
   * Core asset markets generally not priced for a US recession &amp; equity risk premium remains low
      * If this Vol reset is sustained, equity implied vol no longer looks like an outlier in that mix
* ***One explanation for the sharp drop-off in IV is the market is reducing the weight its been placing on catastrophic economic outcomes from Fed fast &amp; aggressive hike path***
   * Market narrative has shifted...
   * Continued progress towards lower inflation, Fed looks likely to downshift again, labor markets remaining strong
* ***Looking ahead -&gt; Easier to see scenarios where IVs move at least \*somewhat\* higher from here (as opposed to much lower)... especially as excess risk premium has been priced out***
   * Our (GS) base case would justify a modest increase in equity IV throughout 2023 from these levels as the unemployment rate rises, while a recession scenario would see a sharp increase in IV levels from here
* ***With options-implied equity Vol &amp; SKEW both \*LOW\*, downside protection for those wanting a hedge against recession is cheaper than it has been for a while...***
   * Equity pricing indicates further relaxation about recession risks lately... &amp; credit implied vol is also near one-year lows
   * Equity &amp; credit puts both screen well as \*recession hedges\* at this point
   * ***We think focusing your hedging/protection on expiries over the next 3 months makes the most sense, given where we believe the peak risks are***
* ***For those seeking upside exposure -&gt; Equity Call options are also cheaper than they have been in some time***
   * Equity options have already priced out much of the ""recession risk premium"" that had been embedded -&gt; thus... Call options are less vulnerable to IV declines in rallies than they have been in recent months ***(Note... at VolSignals we disagree with this take. Our view is that, IF the market (SPX) finds solid ground above \~SPX 4050-4100, we will begin to see a ""return to normalcy"", wherein IV - Spot correlation starts to look more like years past)***

# Equity IV Pricing a Soft Landing...

***Equity IV has dropped off sharply since the turn of the year -&gt; IV across expiries &amp; indices has reset to levels near their lowest in the last 12 months... although current levels look more \*normal\* over a longer history (See Below)***

***Seems like market/consensus went from ""overpricing"" recession tail-risk to... well, now, underpricing it...***

***Seems to be continued progress towards lower inflation -&gt; the pace of Fed hikes has downshifted &amp; looks likely to continue doing so, &amp; labor market has remained strong.***

With the bar for a ""reacceleration"" in the pace of tightening presumably high, the weight on the right-tail of possible rate outcomes has certainly come down -&gt; and with that, so too has the weight on extreme left-tail economic outcomes caused by overtightening.

***Unemployment Rate is key driver in Goldman's model -&gt; Continued strength in the labor market is a clear factor anchoring volatility in this framework***

* However... US economic data is unusually disparate at the moment
   * *Clear weakness in the business surveys in particular*
* Simple scatterplots suggest that IV perhaps a bit higher than usual (not much) relative to most labor market measures
   * *Low, however, relative to the ISM*
* Goldman's view -&gt; the labor market is the more intuitive variable to key off of, given the connections between the unemployment rate &amp; risk premia as investors are more risk averse when their incomes are at more risk than they otherwise would be
* ***IF it ends up that the very weak ISM is an early indicator that the US economy &amp; labor market are heading into recession (not GS base case\*)... that outcome is NOT currently priced into equity IV, and IV should be quite a bit higher***

***Takeaways on Several Fronts...***

* IV could be vulnerable to renewed recession worries -&gt; Goldman's view is that recession risks might be highest in the near-term &amp; may then begin to fade as the peak drag from the financial conditions tightening that we've seen diminishes throughout 2023 (absent a fresh tightening shock)
* In Goldman's ""soft-landing"" base case -&gt;
   * Unemployment rate is set to rise to 3.9% by end-of-year 2023 -&gt; This would justify a modest increase in equity IV (all else equal)
* ""Hard Landing"" would see a sharp increase in IV levels
* Given simple scenario analysis -&gt; easier to make the case for IV moving somewhat higher from here (as opposed to lower), especially as much of the excess risk premia has evaporated
   * The market, by Goldman's estimates, would be pricing future volatility lower than the ""macro-supported"" level if it resets IV much lower...
   * Core asset markets generally have not been priced for a US recession &amp; the equity risk premia remains low -&gt; if the recent reset lower is sustained, equity options pricing no longer looks like an outlier against that backdrop
* With IV &amp; SKEW both \*low\* &amp; at levels that are not pricing recessionary outcomes -&gt;
   * ***Downside protection is cheaper than it has been for a while...***
   * Equity &amp; credit puts screen well as hedges
   * Focus protection over the next few months given where risks to the narrative are

https://i.redd.it/ezv725t6bqca1.gif

***TL; DR -&gt; IVs \*were\* overpriced -&gt; post CPI last week, they have swung to ""underpriced"" given macro backdrop. Risk/reward favors long IV (options) at these levels. Focus on expiries over next \~3 months, as that's where major risks to the consensus narrative would present.***",Goldman Sachs Global Markets -&gt; Equity Implied Vol Pricing a Soft Landing...

1412,StockMarket,"# JPM Recommending Put Spreads on ALLY &amp; KMX to exploit trends in auto lending -&gt;

**ALLY -&gt; BUY Put Spread on weakening auto trends &amp; likely higher credit reserves**

***The Strategy:***

* *ALLY Feb17th $22 - $25 strike Put Spread (at $0.60); 2.2% premium vs. $27.06 reference price*
* Analysts highlight continued normalization of used car values into 2023, near-term headwinds with credit from artificially low charge-off rates, &amp; moderating demand from increased interest rates

***The Rationale:***

* JPM Consumer Finance analyst (Shane) &amp; team rate ALLY as NEUTRAL with a Dec2023 PT of $27
   * Auto focused lending business could see declines from weakness in Q4'22 trends
   * Auto delinquencies, defaults, repos &amp; losses all typically increase during recessionary periods
   * Current used car values (per Manheim index) indicate multi-year highs, suggesting further normalization in 2023
   * Additionally -&gt; increased rates may fundamentally lessen the demand for new auto loans &amp; leases, while rate-hedging activities may not fully offset adverse effects on financials (ie, cost of funding may rise w/o fully offsetting interest &amp; finance charge income)
   * ALLY relies on ABS market to securitize its auto loan origination -&gt; poor liquidity in capital markets could influence profitability of its lending business

https://preview.redd.it/gepapt14gpca1.png?width=599&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6ce50d065f4e9d83d5241ec424a5e725e2cb5047

***After falling over 46% in 2022... ALLY has risen nearly 10.7% YTD -&gt; outperforming both SPX &amp; KBW Bank Index***

Despite stock's recent move higher... JPM's team expects credit reserves &amp; net charge-offs to increase in '23, normalizing from artificially low levels -&gt; this could drive estimates lower &amp; limit upside in the stock.

Strikes of 22 &amp; 25 correspond to 0.65x &amp; 0.75x price-to-book ratios -&gt; levels where the stock trades historically w/depressed valuations when dealing w/slower demand &amp; higher credit expenses.

***STRATEGY CONSIDERATIONS***

ALLY's 1-M Implied Volatility SKEW looks attractive compared to trading levels across the last 1y &amp; 3y horizon, as the ATM-90% Volatility spread trades below the 8th %ile &amp; the 9th %ile for those periods, respectively.

ALLY's options implied earnings move of 4.1% appears inline compared to the average of 4.2% over the last 2 years &amp; its Q4'22 earnings report is confirmed for Jan 20th.

**KMX -&gt; BUY Feb Put Spread after stock rebounds YTD &amp; used auto values expected to weaken, driving loan losses**

***The Strategy:***

* *KMX Feb17th $55 - $60 Put Spread (at $1.00); 1.5% premium vs. $65.00 reference price*
* JPM analysts have recently downgraded the stock to Underweight
   * Earnings expected in Apr 2023, its 1-M Implied Volatility looks inexpensive to realized-volatility, and lateral results &amp; commentary about auto-lending trends from financial firms could provide read-throughs &amp; downside catalysts for the stock

***The Rationale:***

* In Nov 2022, JPM highlighted a downside options strategy upon downgrade to Neutral (at that time), driven by a reduction of EPS estimates
   * After re-testing 1-Year low for the stock, nearing $57/share by December, KMX shares have rallied 6.8% YTD, outperforming the broader market
   * After seeing the potential for higher-than-expected credit expenses at its auto-finance segment (CAF) from declining auto residual values, JPM downgraded to Underweight w/a Dec2023 PT of $60
   * Declines expected due to:
      * Higher credit charge-offs
      * Compressing margins, EPS &amp; multiples

***STRATEGY CONSIDERATIONS***

KMX's 1-M Implied Volatility looks attractive to realized-volatility as that spread trades below the 23rd %ile &amp; below the 20th %ile over the last 1 &amp; 3 years, respectively.

This Put Spread strategy delivers a 5.0x payoff on premium paid at expiry, while the risk of loss is limited to the 1.5% premium paid.

**Overview**

Crocs sell footwear under 2 brands, Crocs, and the recent acquisition HEYDUDE. Their distribution channel consists of wholesalers (selling bulk to retailers) and directs to consumers According to Piper Sandler's teen survey and The NPD Group‚Äôs Retail Tracking Service Croc brand is respectively 5th favorite for teens+mens and 4th favorite for kids. Also with the acquisition of HEYDUDE, they own the 7th favorite brand in Piper Sandler's teen survey.

**Income Breakdown**

When you think of Crocs you think of clogs which accounted for just over half of $985 million and the Croc brand operating margin of 27.9% in Q3. HEYDUDE had $269 million on a 28% operating margin. Guidance: Originally expectations of HEYDUDE were 1 billion by 2024 but management says ""it's sort of pretty obvious that we will achieve that next year. So \[we‚Äôve\] achieved that kind of billion dollar mark by 2023"" showing the rapid growth of HEYDUDE Crocs are guiding for long-term operating margin to be 27%. After expecting to finish 2022 with 53% revenue growth Crocs has guided for 10-13% $3.9B-$4.0B from 2022 expected revenue of $3.55B.

**How concerned should we be with a net debt position of $3.77 billion?**

I am not concerned but it is a hurdle for management. Crocs took a $2 billion loan that matures in 2029 amassing the LTD to $2.6 billion. Using my estimates we end with $3.4 billion in free cash flow in the next 5 years which will be enough to cover the loan in 6 years. Management has already seen the debt and has reduced borrowing by $300 million in the 4th quarter and $500 million since the acquisition of HEYDUDE.

**Competition**

&amp;#x200B;

||**Gross Margin**|Operating Margin|Net Margin|ROIC|ROA|ROE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|CROX|  **54.31%**|  **24.74%**|  **17.43%**|  **20.77%**|  **17.72%**|  **113.31%**|
|NKE|  **44.59%**|  **12.99%**|  **11.47%**|  **18.94%**|  **14.34%**|  **37.32%**|
|UA|  **47.37%**|  **3.37%**|  **2.53%**|  **4.3%**|  **3.03%**|  **7.63%**|

Crocs have been able to churn profits and reinvest its capital better than competitors. Are these numbers relatively high for Crocs? No, I don't believe that the mentioned margins are too high as Croc's has built a brand name for their products and continues to expand on them which will lead to margin expansion. They have expanded using Jibbitz contributing to 6% of revenue, Jibbitz are placed in the holes of clogs and customizable to each shoe. Management said they will have jibbitz on HEYDUDES. I'd like to mention margins have been hit already since the COVID surge.

**Threats**

1. Established companies with a significant presence in the footwear industry, such as Under Armor, Adidas, and Nike, pose a serious threat to Crocs Inc.

2. Footwear is cyclical and trendy meaning consumers may be unfavorable for Crox as we have seen in the past, consumers may start to favor alternative shoe designs, which would reduce the market for Crocs goods. They have branched into different shoe designs with the acquisition of HEYDUDE

3. Consumer spending will be significantly impacted by the impending recession, which would lower Crocs Inc.'s sales. The business had to lay off 2,000 employees and close hundreds of locations throughout the world in the 2008 recession.

**After all research explain evaluation + valuation of the company (**[**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-J89yKxMGiJtDdF6xAPB2bMkj32j0jpvpeT3O70Azc/edit?usp=sharing**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y-J89yKxMGiJtDdF6xAPB2bMkj32j0jpvpeT3O70Azc/edit?usp=sharing)**)** 

Now to the question of the title. If you have held Crocs so far congratulations, you've made a nice profit but you should start to sell if you haven‚Äôt, it never hurts to realize gains and start the year off positive. Crocs has proven to be volatile and host a beta of 1.8. I personally don‚Äôt have a large enough account to sell puts but if I did I would be selling them for around $100 with whatever date you deem a good risk/reward. Now what I will do is I will put a trigger price at $105 and come back to this post to see if my thesis changed.

I haven't done an analysis like this and didn't go as in-depth as I had hoped. You may be interested in the company's buyback history and go in-depth with the management. I would appreciate feedback and may not respond quickly as I still have high school classes.",Is it time to sell Crocs(CROX) after 165% rally?,1673993643

1443,StockMarket,"What is it:

EBIT stands for Earnings Before Interest and Taxes. It is a measure of a company's profitability that calculates its earnings before deducting interest and taxes.¬†

It is often used as a measure of a company's operating performance and is considered a key indicator of its ability to generate profits from its core business operations.

&amp;#x200B;

Calculations: 

There are multiple ways you can calculate EBIT:

* EBIT = Revenue - COGS - Operating Expenses
* EBIT = Net Income + Interest + Taxes

COGS stands for cost of goods sold. You can find this financial data on the company‚Äôs financial statements.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Why it's important:  


EBIT, or Earnings Before Interest and Taxes, is an important financial metric because it measures a company's profitability before considering the cost of borrowing money or paying taxes. This lets investors and analysts understand the company's operational performance and overall financial health.¬†

Chinese electric car maker [Xpeng Inc](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=614962373). has cut prices for most of its vehicles by around 10%, joining other auto makers in lowering prices as competition heats up in the country's fast-expanding electric-vehicle market.

The company said in a statement on Tuesday that it will slash prices for multiple versions of its P7, P5 and G3i models by 20,000 yuan (US$2,970) to CNY36,000 yuan, representing about a 10% drop from current prices. In particular, the starting price for Xpeng's (XPEV) best-selling P7 sedan will be reduced by 12.5%.

The price cuts will take effect from Tuesday afternoon, the company said. Xpeng has kept prices unchanged for its new G9 model.

For car owners who purchased Xpeng automobiles before the price cut, Xpeng said it will extend maintenance services for free as compensation.

Xpeng's move came after [Tesla Inc](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=24812378).

1462,StockMarket,"On Jan 13, the three major indexes all closed higher on the big banks‚Äô earnings‚Äò reports, at one month high. At the close, the Dow was up 0.33%, the Nasdaq was up 0.71%, and the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.4%. The 10-year US Treasury yield rose 1.8% to 3.455%, compared with a yield spread of -73 bps over the two-year note. VIX was down 2.55%. Brent crude closed up 1.85%. Spot gold closed up 1.24% at $1,920.32 an ounce. The dollar index was down 0.07%, closing at 102.18.

.

The quarterly U.S. consumer price index in December came in at -0.1 %, the first negative reading since May 2020, which economists attributed to lower energy costs. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of CPI came in at 6.5 %, falling for the sixth consecutive month and the smallest increase since October 2021. The core CPI rose at a non-seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.7 %, the smallest increase since December 2021. The US core CPI rose modestly in December, adding to evidence that price pressures are easing and giving the Federal Reserve room to slow the pace of interest rate hikes next month.

Here‚Äôs what the company reported:

* Earnings: $3.32 per share vs. $5.48 estimate of analysts surveyed by Refinitiv
* Revenue: $10.59 billion vs. $10.83 billion

The bank said quarterly profit fell 66% from a year earlier to $1.33 billion, or $3.32 per share, well below the Refinitiv estimate. Revenue held up better at $10.59 billion, down 16% from a year earlier and edging out the consensus estimate.

Shares of the New York-based bank dipped 2.4% in premarket trading.

How long will the investment banking drought last?

That‚Äôs one of the top questions analysts will have for Goldman CEO David Solomon.

While the fourth quarter was an ugly one for bankers ‚Äî Wall Street rivals JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup each posted declines in investment banking revenue of nearly 60% last week ‚Äî analysts question the odds of a rebound sometime later this year.

They‚Äôll also want to hear Solomon‚Äôs views on headcount and expenses after the bank laid off up to 3,200 employees last week, as well as details about Goldman‚Äôs consumer operations as it scales back ambitions there.

Goldman shares have climbed 8.9% this year going into Tuesday‚Äôs trading, compared with a 6.7% advance for the KBW Bank Index.

Last week, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America topped profit expectations on surging net interest income, while Wells Fargo and Citigroup posted mixed results. ¬†Morgan Stanley is also scheduled to release results Tuesday.

The demand for CBD in health and wellness products is constantly increasing as more research focuses on its potential for promoting relaxation, pain management, and other advantages for living a healthy life. CRTL, a manufacturer of hemp cigars and CBD products from the United States, is maximizing their chances of profiting from the boom through innovation and superior product lines.

Cartel International (CRTL), which has recorded a rather noticeable jump in sales for their hemp cigars, which are 100% organic, made of hemp cultivated hydroponically, and contain no nicotine, says the demand has increased significantly over the years.

* Because of their distinctive preparation procedure, hand-rolled manner, and lack of nicotine throughout the process, Cartel cigars have become well-known in the United States.
* According to CRTL's most recent press release, the firm is progressing and has established itself as one of the major players in the US market for CBD.
* The hemp cigars are now offered with a flat 10% discount just for initial orders on the website. Just utilize the website's code and taste your first hemp cigar while saving your money.

The business is expanding quickly, with plans to ramp up production since the market wants more of what Cartel has and what others don't.

When liquidators took over it two weeks ago, wallet addresses starting with ‚Äú0x997‚Äù held a short position of 9,000 ETH ($10.8 million) and collateral of 20 million USDC and 4 million DAI, net balance of $15.2 million. Today, the account‚Äôs current value is $1.1 million as short ETH with collateral of $1.4 million in USDC: a net balance of $300,000.

Arkham said that this is the latest in a string of market activity that has weakened many short positions in Alameda after bankruptcy.

On December 29, about 30 hours after liquidators started moving assets out of the Alameda wallet, the Alameda wallet transferred $7 million USDC and $4 million DAI from the decentralized crypto lending platform intermediate AAVE to a separate optimistic L2 account occurs.

[https://news.coincu.com/161148-alameda-wallet-lost-about-11-5-million/](https://news.coincu.com/161148-alameda-wallet-lost-about-11-5-million/)

This withdrawal puts the position at high risk of liquidation, resulting in 11.4 million USDC being sold to the liquidation bot on Optimism and an additional 100,000 USDC being collected as liquidation tax by the AAVE vault.

Arkham explained that if the liquidator used a function to instantly close the position by selling the collateral instead of withdrawing it from the wallet, at least $15 million could be kept instead of $11 million being recovered. Therefore, a preventable loss is equivalent to $4 million.

Before that, on January 13, liquidator Alameda lost $72,000 on Aave while trying to consolidate funds. Coincu News updated on January 15 that Alameda wallet has lost over $1 million in assets due to liquidation.",Alameda Wallet Under The Control Of The Liquidator Lost About $11.5 Million,1673940820

1525,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**:  I remain in the camp that last week's move (especially the IWM) was only meant to lure in retail investors.  The failure for all 3x majors to clear the bear channel (or even for them all to reach it) in my opinion suggests there is not enough momentum behind even the IWM's very clear break out.  That said, while volume was light for most of the last week, it did not seem incredibly light.  I could make an argument for the reversal to come as early as tomorrow...or...I could make another for SPY and QQQ to join IWM's break out, and then the reversal comes.  So who knows...I certainly do not...just my guess.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY:**  The 'mid-range' chart compared to IWM (leading) and QQQ (lagging).  Unlike IWM, price has yet to breakout of the bear channel; but also unlike QQQ, price has at least cleared the gap window and is knocking on the channel ceiling.  Friday's close left price right at the major support level, which is only firming as the gap-fill and bear channel descending TL converge.  If price follows the small cap's lead, then 410.49 pivot high is the next major resistance level.  If price fails, then 387.41 bear flag's top will offer some support, but 382.27 is the major support level which the bulls need to hold.  If the bear's regain control of the micro-trend, then 368.79 will be tested again as the next major support level, more so than the bear flag's bottom (374.77) in my opinion.

https://preview.redd.it/tyj0f2o9pgca1.jpg?width=2314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6025cc4d07bf877e8f2221371eb065109af758de

**QQQ:**  Tech continues to lag in terms of hitting technical levels.  Price has yet to reach the gap-window,  let alone the bear channel ceiling.  As a result, 282.33 will offer some resistance, with 186.51 - 288.21 being the major resistance level this coming week.  If price manages to breakout here as it has in the small caps, then the 200 DMA and 296.88 pivot high will be the next major resistance.  If price fails at these levels, then 274.78 - 273.72 is a major support area as 2x former breakout trendlines converege.  This the bulls cannot hold this level, then 259.08 is the next major support area.

https://preview.redd.it/e56iuhr4ogca1.jpg?width=2313&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d05c1629678f92d374eda77ce178062b843224ba

**IWM**: Friday's close officially made the bear channel's descending TL a support level. If price continues higher, next resistance point is 189.56 pivot high from November/December 2022; I believe this will be a major level.  Additionally, around 195 is a long-running channel TL from where the index was trading leading into the COVID-collapse; this, too, should be a major resistance level. If the bears roar back from the holiday, the bear channel TL at 183.05 is first support (and major, if the bulls want to hold the trend). Failure to hold that level will bring 180.19 into focus as the next support, but I believe ths level will be minor.  Lastly, the ascending TL which lead to these series of breakouts is the final major support level at 175.25 - 176.50 over the course of the coming week.

&amp;#x200B;

**Data**

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j1jXghwSWRnwzbHqkfeAxvXSSaBPLrrHFOiglABGvUs/edit?usp=sharing) is a Google Sheet with all 3-Day Weekend Returns since SPY started in 1993.

&amp;#x200B;

**Analysis**

There have been 188 3-day weekends. 56% of the time, the SPY opens higher on Tuesday morning than it closed on Friday night with average returns of 0.03% (7.8% annualized).

The best day was September, 8th, 1998. If you would've bought on Friday, September 4th, you would've woken up to 3.2% gains on Tuesday.

The worst day was January 22, 2008. You would've woken up down 3.7%.

In the last 10 years, 3-day weekends have been better. There have been 64 3-day weekends. Only 52% have been positive, but the average returns have been 0.08% (22% annualized)!

**Conclusion**

Overall: useless. 

In the last ten years, you'd have had 22% annualized returns if you bought at the close before the long weekend and sold at the open of the next week, but considering this happens like 5 times a year and has an n of 64, it's still useless lol",[Analysis] Does the SPY tend to open green after a 3-day weekend?,1673900356

Below are from [https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/24/2022-17994/updating-spending-weights-annually-based-on-a-single-calendar-year-of-data](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/24/2022-17994/updating-spending-weights-annually-based-on-a-single-calendar-year-of-data)

To improve the accuracy and relevance of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) plans to update spending weights annually based on a single calendar year of data. This change will be effective with the calculation of January 2023 indexes using consumer expenditure data from 2021.

Historically, the BLS updated spending weights every 10 years to reflect spending habits of urban consumers. In 2002, the BLS began updating spending weights every two years to reflect changes in consumer spending more rapidly. Over time, many countries have adopted annual CPI spending weight updates. The BLS produces continuous estimates of consumer spending, enabling an annual weight update methodology.

 Recent research conducted by the BLS demonstrates annual spending weight updates increase the overall accuracy of the CPI. As an accurate cost-of-living measure, the CPI should reflect consumers' changing spending habits. The formula the BLS uses to calculate the CPI-U and CPI-W can yield misleading results if spending weights are updated too frequently. The BLS conducted research in 2021 that demonstrates annual spending weight updates more closely reflect consumers' changing spending habits without yielding misleading results. The estimated impact between 2002-2020 is a reduction in the 12-month change of the CPI-U index of 0.036 percentage points, which is a 13% reduction in the impact of upper-level substitution bias. Upper-level substitution bias refers to the impact of using fixed weights even though consumers change (substitute) what they buy.

Annual spending weight updates enable the BLS to maintain relevancy when there are large shifts in consumer spending, as happened during the COVID-19 pandemic. While sudden shifts in spending habits cannot be reflected in an annual update, annual spending changes are an improvement over longer periods. The BLS analyzed annual spending changes and confirmed the spending weight update in January 2022 should use consumer spending from 2019 and 2020. While in past years, the most recent year is typically the most relevant, spending in 2020 was anomalous enough that averaging two years of data produced the most relevant spending weights for indexes in 2022. For 2023, the BLS determined consumer spending data in 2021 would be more relevant than 2019 and 2020. It is expected that moving forward, using the most recent year of data will produce the most relevant spending weights for CPI calculation.",CPI weight change: is this to manipulate the number?,1673880303

\[‚Ä¶\] However, we **operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to political and regulatory uncertainty**, including with respect to trade and the environment, all of which may also be compounded by any future global impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, **inflationary pressures, rising energy prices and increases in interest rates**. Moreover, **as additional competitors enter the marketplace** and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and continue to execute well to maintain our momentum.

High risks in the company image is high too, laughable the fact that they cited Musk as ‚ÄúTechnoking of Tesla‚Äù.

Interesting the part where they said they ‚Äúmight not have enough liquidity to cover costs and expenses and debts that might limit their operations and there is no guarantee that they will have sufficient cash flow to pay indebtedness. This is Bad.‚Äù

A company is about to bankrupt, strange price action, this gives me a d√©j√† vu feeling, I wonder if this is another GME. So I checked the short interest, it‚Äôs 33.72% on December 30th, although not as high as the GME one, but still remarkably high, are traders buying it for a short squeeze? The retail traders battling Wall Street scenario is happening again?

1581,StockMarket," BTC price optimism is limited at best after multi-month highs, with Bitcoin traders fearing a reversion to macro lows.  

Bitcoin may be circling its highest levels in months, but few are convinced that the bull market is back.

 Ahead of a key weekly close, BTC/USD remains near $21,000, data from [Cointelegraph Markets Pro](https://pro.cointelegraph.com/?via=markets&amp;_ga=2.142027444.742658523.1640948929-762064149.1640948929) and [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/?exchange=BINANCE) shows, with analysts nervous about the good times ending all too soon. 

 

Bitcoin is dividing opinion after its week of brisk gains. Warnings over a potential pullback abound, while others are already commiserating bears ahead of time.

‚ÄúNow bears will be caught in the vicious cycle of praying for pullbacks to go lower, not realizing the tides have shifted for a time and we‚Äôre going higher,‚Äù Chris Burniske, former head of crypto at ARK Invest, [summarized](https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/1614334062386372608).

Even more optimistic takes such as that of Burniske, however, do not foresee the upside continuing uninterrupted in a definitive end to Bitcoin‚Äôs latest bear market.

Uploading the classic ‚ÄúWall Street Cheat Sheet‚Äù graphic over the weekend, popular commentator Lemon predicted that BTC/USD would still fall further.

‚ÄúSorry, I have to be true to my thoughts, I think we are here,‚Äù he [told](https://twitter.com/TheCryptoLemon/status/1614193273404551168) Twitter followers, pointing to Bitcoin sentiment ‚Äî and price ‚Äî heading toward macro lows.",Bitcoin price blasts past $21K as 3-day short liquidations near $300M,1673843343

**BEWARE... S&amp;P500 EARNINGS REVISIONS POINT TO A HARD LANDING**

* Current 3-month trend of S&amp;P 500 forward EPS revision sentiment is the most negative reading outside of 2008 &amp; 2020 recessions
* GS forecasts that EPS falls 11% in hard landing scenario vs baseline of flat/consensus of +3%
* This gap largely reflects GS' lower margin expectations
* In a recession... GS expects large downward revisions to consensus EPS forecasts in Consumer Discretionary &amp; Industrials

Neonode is a technology company that asserts it invented the touch function. They hold patents 993 and 879 for this technology. Recently, Neonode emerged victorious in an IPR (Inter Partes Review) against both Apple and Samsung, with the judge ruling that Neonode's invention was a commercial success and had prior art in patent 879. Additionally, Neonode was granted a win in an IPR using the same patent against Alphabet. This means that their patent is not unpatentable, and they have a valid case against any company using touchscreen technology.

If they win in court, the potential outcome in terms of damages could reach billions of dollars. This is based on a previous contract between Neonode and Samsung, in which Samsung agreed to pay 2 euros per unit, thereby acknowledging Neonode's patent on the technology. This could result in triple damages.

If Neonode prevails in court against these tech giants, they could potentially sue other technology companies that produce products using touchscreen technology such as Nokia, Huawei, and Motorola, among others. Following the win against Alphabet, Neonode's stock price saw a 50% increase, and the win against Samsung and Apple resulted in a 46% increase in the stock price.

*****
&gt; Stocks rose Friday as investors digested bank earnings and bet inflation would ease in 2023.
*****
&gt; All of the major indexes fought their way into the green after beginning the day deep in the red. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 112.64 points, or 0.33%, to 34,302.61. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.40% to 3,999.09, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.71% to 11,079.16.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P and Nasdaq each posted their second consecutive positive week and best weekly performance since November. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was the outperformer for the week after rising 4.82%. The S&amp;P advanced 2.67%, and the Dow added 2%.
*****
&gt; Bank earnings weighed on equities to start the day, but sentiment reversed as investors appeared to shrug off negative news that was expected to some degree, according to Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúFinancials weren‚Äôt really quite expected to have a blockbuster quarter,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just providing a bit of a sentiment wave, and since the banks lead earnings season they can kind of set the tone for how investors look at the broader picture.‚Äù
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúFrankly, the market has rallied pretty nicely over the last few weeks, absent a catalyst, and so there might be a little bit of profit taking out of earnings season going,‚Äù Mayfield added.
*****
&gt; Wells Fargo, whose profits for the last quarter had been cut by half, said it‚Äôs preparing for the economy to ‚Äúget worse than it‚Äôs been over the last few quarters.‚Äù
*****
&gt; JPMorgan Chase posted revenue that beat expectations, but even so, the bank warned it‚Äôs setting aside more money to cover credit losses because a ‚Äúmild recession‚Äù is its ‚Äúcentral case.‚Äù The bank posted a $2.3 billion provision for credit losses in the quarter, a 49% increase from the third quarter.
*****
&gt; The CEOs of Citigroup and Bank of America also said they‚Äôre anticipating a ‚Äúmild recession.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Delta Air Lines reported earnings and revenue that beat estimates for the final quarter of 2022. However, the stock slid 3.5%. Investors have been awaiting these results to gain more insight into the health of the economy.
*****
&gt; In economic data, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey showed the one-year inflation outlook down to 4%, the third straight monthly decrease and the lowest level since April 2021.
*****
&gt; That followed December‚Äôs CPI report, released Thursday, which showed prices declined 0.1% over November. While prices rose at a 6.5% pace compared to the previous year, the results heightened hopes that the Federal Reserve may soon slow its hiking.

&gt; # Bears Back Down

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has rallied impressively in the past week leading up to Thursday's CPI print, and bullish sentiment has lifted along with it. While the reading remains low, the percentage of respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reporting as bullish rose from 20.5% up to 24%. Bulls were higher only two weeks ago when the reading was at 26.5%

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011223-Sentiment-1.png))**

&gt; That rise in bulls has meant bearish sentiment has fallen to a notable level. For the first time since the first week of November and for only the eleventh time in the past year, bearish sentiment came in below 40%. Bearish sentiment has now fallen for three weeks in a row, which is the longest streak of consecutive declines since last August as well.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011223-Sentiment-2.png))**

&gt; Although bullish and bearish sentiment are sending a more optimistic tone, the bull-bear spread remains heavily in favor of bears at -15.9. That grows the record streak of negative readings to 41 weeks in a row.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011223-Sentiment-4.png))**

&gt; Last week, neutral sentiment leaped higher given the mid-single-digit declines in bulls and bears. Some of that move was given back this week with only 36% reporting as neutral. However, that remains an elevated reading at 4.6 percentage points above the historical average.

&gt; # A Trifecta for Stocks in 2023?

&gt; ‚ÄúIf you torture numbers enough, they will tell you anything.‚Äù Yogi Berra

&gt; Stocks have seemingly gone up each day this year, which is quite different from what we all experienced last year. Today I‚Äôll look at some potentially positive developments which indeed could have bulls smiling in 2023.

&gt; It‚Äôs been a strong start to 2023, with stocks up nicely after the first five days. Although we‚Äôd never suggest investing based on five days, this is something many people watch for clues as to how the year might go, and it has a solid track record. As Yogi told us, if you have a bias, you can likely get the numbers to confirm that bias. We‚Äôll try just to state the facts, and the facts do suggest this is a good sign. Of course, let‚Äôs not forget that stocks were down the first five days last year, and we know how that worked out.

&gt; It turns out that when the first five days are higher for the S&amp;P 500, the full year is higher nearly 81% of the time and up 14.0% on average. Compare this to when those days are lower, and the full year is virtually flat and up only 54% of the time. Lastly, when these five days are up more than 1% (like 2023‚Äôs 1.4% gain), the full year does even better, up 15.4% on average and higher more than 86% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/blog-184-800x277.png))**

&gt; Let‚Äôs take things a little bit deeper now‚Ä¶ We talked a lot about the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) last month, and the good news is that stocks, indeed, were higher during those historically bullish seven days. When stocks are higher during the SCR, the first five days of the year, and in January, the full year has historically done quite well.

&gt; Below we show the 31 times that the trifecta of bullishness (I may have made that word up, but I like it) happened, and the full year finished in the green more than 90% of the time and gained 17.5% on average. Sure, this month isn‚Äôt over yet, but we are off to a great start, and a higher January could be in the cards. If you are bullish, you should be rooting for a green January based on the table below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/blog-214-800x742.png))**

&gt; Lastly, stocks were down last year, which makes the potential trifecta in 2023 even more special. That‚Äôs because when the previous year saw stocks in the red, the annual returns of the S&amp;P 500 the following year were typically strong (just look at those numbers in the righthand column in the table below!). In fact, stocks have never been lower during the year and gained more than 27% on average. After last year, that‚Äôs something I think we‚Äôd all take!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/blog-369-800x402.png))**

&gt; There are still many worries out there, but we continue to see more positives than negatives, and we think 2023 could actually be quite a good year for investors. We are putting the finishing touches on Outlook 2023: The Edge Of Normal, and we can‚Äôt wait to share it with you soon. Be on the lookout for it.

&gt; # Claims Drop But Were the Holidays Helping?

&gt; Initial jobless claims posted another low reading in the latest print, with national seasonally adjusted claims totaling only 205K. That was down slightly from 206K the previous week; a number revised up by 2K. After that revision, this week's reading was the strongest showing for claims since the end of September.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011223-Claims-1.png))**

&gt; Before seasonal adjustment, claims were considerably higher at 339.29K. At the end of the year and in the first weeks of a new year, claims tend to experience a significant seasonal increase which appears to be playing out in the current environment. This year's reading is in line with the comparable weeks of the few years prior to the pandemic. As we also noted last week, this time of year tends to see the largest revisions in claims as well. In other words, from a seasonal perspective, claims can be a bit volatile in terms of actual levels and revised levels. So while the seasonally adjusted reading was solid and the non-seasonally adjusted number is nothing too concerning, the next several weeks will likely provide a clearer reading on how claims are trending.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011223-Claims-2.png))**

&gt; Turning to continuing claims, this week's print covered the final week of 2022. Like initial claims, the end of the year saw declines in continuing claims with the latest reading falling to a low of 1.634 million; the strongest level since the week of November 19th. Although that is a solid improvement following multiple months of claims rising rapidly, similary to initial claims, more weeks of data will help to provide a clearer picture given the effects of seasonality during the holidays.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011223-Claims-3.png))**

&gt; We would also note, that although the drop in claims over the past two weeks has only put a small dent in the recent rise in claims, the 4.89% decline is historically large. That drop impressively ranks in the bottom 3% of all 2-week moves on record.

&gt; # Why is Everyone Predicting a Recession?

&gt; Almost every outlook you open this season has forecasters predicting that 2023 will see a recession. In contrast, we here on the Carson Investment Research Team believe the economy can avoid a recession this year.

&gt; Note that the recession calls are all forecasts and clearly do not reflect where the economy is right now. For example, looking at the NBER‚Äôs preferred list of economic indicators, which they use for determining recession, every single one grew over the past three months and year-to-date (2022). Moreover, four of the six indicators exceeded their pre-pandemic growth rates over the past three months (comparing the yellow bars against the dark blue bars).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-2023-01-11-recession-indicators-585x800.png))**

&gt; Obviously, the above is data for 2022, and the question is what happens in 2023. For one thing, inflation looks to be falling ‚Äì and with wage growth remaining strong, real incomes will be higher. In addition, lower gas prices, lower energy prices (utilities), and lower food prices mean consumers should have more money in their pockets. Just as higher inflation is effectively an income tax, falling prices are akin to a tax cut. And unless households choose to save this excess income, this will likely keep consumption up.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-2023-01-11-real-incomes-601x800.png))**

&gt; Concerning tax cuts, thirty-eight states have significant tax changes that took effect on January 1st. As the Tax Foundation notes, most of these represent net tax reductions, which result from a wave of tax cuts we saw over the past two years as state revenues surged and governors/legislatures looked to ease the impact of higher prices on residents.

&gt; Also, social security recipients are slated to receive a cost-of-living adjustment of 8.7% to their incomes in 2023, a function of the high inflation we saw last year but coming just as inflation starts to pull back. Seniors will get another break from Medicare premiums, slated to fall this year.

&gt; All tailwinds for consumption, which make up 70% of the economy.

&gt; # So, Why the Recession Calls?
In short, forecasters expect the Fed‚Äôs aggressive rate hikes of 2022 to hit the economy in mid-2023 and beyond. The idea is that monetary policy impacts the economy with ‚Äúlong and variable lags.‚Äù Even Fed Chair Powell and other Fed officials have cited the uncertainty around the lagged impact of their rate hikes as a reason for stepping down the pace of rate hikes in December. Instead, they want to wait to see the impact of the 425 bps of rate hikes they did last year.

&gt; However, the reality is that monetary policy impacts the economy through financial conditions. For example, higher interest rates can crimp household demand for mortgages, and tighter credit conditions can crimp business spending, including hiring, CAPEX, and M&amp;A.

&gt; In fact, because of the Fed‚Äôs forward guidance and other commentaries (including leaks to the press), financial conditions can tighten well before actual rate hikes as investors anticipate future Fed actions. You can see this in the chart below ‚Äì across 2022, financial conditions tightened well ahead of the Fed‚Äôs rate hikes.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Blog-2023-01-11-FCI-vs-FFR-601x800.png))**

&gt; This means financial conditions can impact the economy sooner than most expect. The steep falloff in housing activity is a good example of how tighter financial conditions make an impact almost immediately ‚Äì residential investment was a significant drag on GDP growth since the second quarter of 2022, which is when financial conditions started to really tighten in anticipation of the Fed‚Äôs aggressive turn. On an annualized basis, residential investment fell 18% in Q2 2022 and 27% in Q3.

&gt; Goldman Sachs had a research note pointing out that tighter financial conditions impact the economy as soon as rate moves are expected, as opposed to when rate hikes are actually delivered (see chart below). Also, they pointed out that the lags from monetary policy apply to GDP levels as opposed to GDP growth.

&gt; Unexpected policy changes have a peak impact on GDP growth within 1-2 quarters. After that, it starts to wear off, though there is still a negative impact on GDP growth six quarters down. This means there is still a drag on the level of GDP 6 quarters down ‚Äì it‚Äôs just less than what it was in the immediate aftermath of rate moves.

&gt; The confusion between the lagged impact of rate hikes on GDP growth vs. GDP level is perhaps why the consensus view amongst forecasters is a recession in 2023.

&gt; However, we may be beyond the point of peak negative impact of rate hikes on the economy. Most of the tightening in financial conditions occurred during the first three quarters of 2022. Financial conditions have eased since October (coinciding with a stock market rally), which is even more favorable for economic growth as the drag from tight financial conditions declines. The other side of stronger economic growth is that we‚Äôre more likely to see the Fed keep rates at a higher level for longer.

&gt; # Silver Linings Playbook: M&amp;A Edition

&gt; 2022 was a rough year for investors. Stocks had their worst performance in many years, and shareholders are left wondering what is next. However, amidst all the uncertainty with inflation, rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions, supply chain bottlenecks, and volatile capital markets, there were important buyers that saw through these near-term hurdles and focused on long-term value ‚Äì private equity and corporate M&amp;A.

&gt; To be clear, global M&amp;A activity dropped 36% to $3.7 trillion in 2022, according to Dealogic. However, that‚Äôs compared to the all-time record of $5.7 trillion in 2021, which was fueled by strong capital markets and low-interest rates. When comparing 2022‚Äôs deal activity to the average over the past eight years, it was down only about 10%, or just 4% if 2021‚Äôs record high is excluded. This is in stark contrast to just $24 billion being raised through US IPOs, which was the lowest since 2009. Considering all the headwinds and increased regulatory scrutiny, we think global M&amp;A was surprisingly healthy last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BrettBlog_MA-Volumes-800x484.png))**

&gt; What‚Äôs also impressive is the premiums paid recently for publicly-traded M&amp;A targets. During times of high volatility, like in 2022, it‚Äôs not unusual for buyers and sellers to struggle to agree on price. Sellers tend to get anchored to where their stocks used to be when valuations were much higher (2020/2021), and buyers focus on where shares are currently trading (2022). A few of these recent M&amp;A targets got a price close to their all-time highs (Abiomed, Horizon Therapeutics, Altra Industrial Motion). Yet, many sellers came to terms with lower prices compared to the past two years, but at a meaningful premium to their trading levels prior to the announcement.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/BrettBlog_MA-recent-transactions.svg))**

&gt; What can this mean for broader equities? Perhaps that valuations have fallen too far in certain cases. Many of these transactions carry big premiums to where their peers still trade in public markets. Also, many of these recent takeouts were of firms with little to no profits. We find this interesting as investors‚Äô appetites have completely swung from seeking high growth at any cost a couple of years ago to now wanting profitable growth. Or perhaps last year‚Äôs relatively healthy M&amp;A activity proves that ‚Äúanimal spirits‚Äù continue to linger and that the market still needs to adjust to the new reality.

&gt; Our primary takeaway is that investors who take a longer-term perspective can use this recent volatility to purchase quality assets at reasonable or even depressed prices.

&gt; # Higher Rates Wards Off Small Business Expansion

&gt; The National Federation of Small Businesses (NFIB) released its Small Business Optimism Index for December early this morning. The report showed optimism has begun to fade after a modest rebound in the past few months. The index fell back below 90.0 to the lowest level since the June of 89.5.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011023-NFIB-1.png))**

&gt; The 2.1-point drop in the index was also the largest m/m decline since June ranking in the bottom 12% of all m/m moves on record. Given that lower reading, the December print is also now back below the spring 2020 lows putting it in the bottom decile of its historical range. Breadth within the report was abysmal with only one input to the headline index (current inventory) moving higher m/m while plans to increase inventories was the only input unchanged. The rest of the categories experienced significant declines, some of which rank in the bottom few percentiles of all monthly moves.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011023-NFIB-1a.png))**

&gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, employment metrics were not a bright spot. Overall, labor market conditions continue to roll over. Hiring plans hit the lowest level since January 2021, and the percentage reporting job openings are hard to fill likewise dropped to the lowest levels since the start of 2021. On the bright side, compensation recovered from the November decline while firms also reported adding workers on a net basis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011023-NFIB-2.png))**

&gt;The economic outlook remains historically depressed with that index falling 8 points to -51. Although that still has 10 points further to fall to reach the June low, this index continues to hover well outside of historical norms. Given the lack of optimism, a net of only 5% of businesses report now as a good time to expand. Additionally, a higher percentage of businesses are also reporting weaker sales and expectations for weaker sales while observed earnings also continue to worsen in spite of the rollover in prices.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011023-NFIB-2.png))**

&gt; As for a breakdown of the reasons small businesses are reporting now as a good time/not a good time to expand, economic conditions are the main reason given for pessimism. Of those responding now is not a good time to expand, 42% blamed economic conditions while the second highest share (9%) blamed the political climate. The joint next most common reason blamed for pessimism was interest rates and the cost of expansion. For the former, that is the highest reading since at least the start of the pandemic while the latter is the highest reading since July 2021. That high reading in cost of expansion is somewhat surprising given the drop in the higher prices index, however, that could suggest that costs of financing are lumped in with the ""cost of expansion"" category.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/01/011023-NFIB-2a.png))**

&gt; We would also note that the stress of higher rates is also beginning to show up elsewhere in the report. While capital expenditure plans and actual changes to capital expenditures have not seen any major shifts, expected credit conditions fell to the lowest level in nearly a decade. Meanwhile, the availability of loans reached the worst level since September 2014.

&gt; # Short-Term Treasury Yields Provide the Tell

&gt; The yields on short-term Treasuries have been offering up some important tells recently. Below we highlight the yields on 6-month, 12-month, and 2-year Treasuries over the last 12 months. After trading with a positively sloped curve (the longer the duration, the higher the yield) through the first half of 2022, the yields on all three began to converge in late July/early August. In November, the 2-year yield started to drift lower, while yields on the 6-month and 12-month held firm. And just in the last week or so, we've seen the yield on the 12-month start to drift lower as well, while the yield on the 6-month has ticked slightly higher. As things stand now, the 2-year yield is at 4.18%, the 12-month is at 4.66%, and the 6-month is at 4.82%. This means the 2-year is inverted with the 6-month by 64 basis points, while the 12-month is now inverted with the 6-month by 16 basis points.

&gt; Yields on these three Treasuries are telling investors (and the Fed) where ""the market"" expects the Fed Funds Rate to be over the duration of the maturities. Right now the market expects rates to peak at some point in mid-2023 before ultimately pulling back. The fact that no points on the Treasury curve are currently above 5% tells you what the market thinks about the Fed's unanimous support of getting the Fed Funds Rate above 5% and holding it there. It's not buying it. While ""the market"" sees inflationary indicators falling pretty much everywhere it looks, Fedspeak has so far been unwilling to acknowledge any meaningful progress. The more inverted we see longer duration yields become with the 6-month T-Bill, the more damage the hawkish Fedspeak will become.

&gt; # First Five Days Up, Our January Indicator Trifecta is Now 2-0

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3e39d165e194fac0e6541cc5698292d9/f6264f519383d28e-e5/s500x750/d4af7c50ba18737e15c754f2b3df42cdee2679c3.jpg))**

&gt; Even though S&amp;P 500 finished today with a fractional decline, our First Five Day (FFD) early warning system is positive. Over the first five trading days, S&amp;P 500 gained 1.4%. In pre-presidential-election years, such as this year, our FFD has a respectable record with 13 full years following its direction in the last 18 years.

&gt; Last week our Santa Claus Rally was also positive, and with today‚Äôs positive FFD reading there are two possible outcomes remaining for our January Indicator Trifecta. Our January Barometer can either be positive or negative.

&gt; As depicted in the table above a positive January Barometer would further boost prospects for the last 11 months and the full year. When all three indicators were positive the next eleven months have been up 87.1% of the time with an average gain of 12.3% and the full year was positive 28 of 31 times (90.3% of the time) with an average gain of 17.5% in all years.

Following the previous twelve occurrences when the SCR and FFD were positive, and our January Barometer was negative S&amp;P 500 advanced ten times over the remaining eleven months and nine times for the full year with average gains of 9.9% and 6.0% respectively.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/455a081c1e2ef69cfc3a6343ff120832/f6264f519383d28e-c0/s500x750/9ff782836f2f33817cfae432ee53265951a877de.jpg))**

&gt; The December Low Indicator (2023 STA, page 36) should also be watched with the line in the sand at the Dow‚Äôs December Closing Low of 32757.54 on 12/19/2022.

&gt; At this juncture our outlook for 2023 remains unchanged from our annual forecast. We do acknowledge the numerous headwinds that the market is currently facing, but we still contend that the market will continue to climb the proverbial ‚Äúwall of worry‚Äù with choppy trading likely to persist until typical, pre-election year seasonal forces kick in later this year most likely after the Fed signals it will end increasing rates. This could happen as soon as their next meeting at the end of this month, but it may not happen until the Fed meets in March.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the development of Tesla during the past three years, from 2019 to 2022. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration. In addition, a comparison to its main competitors and the market situation is also made. All is made to determine the fair value of the stock price and determine the investment strategy. All is made to answer the following questions:

* What is its position compared to competitors?
* Is the company fairly valued by the market by its fundamentals?
* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

**Delimitations and Assumptions**

This thesis is delimited to an analysis of TSLA between the years 2019 and 2022. The thesis is based on the assumption that TSLA is the one of the most trending automotive company in the world, and that the prestige it has will support its price action in the next months.

**Methodology**

In this thesis, data from its financial statements are taken from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance and other publicly available information on the company on-line. The Company valuation is made based on:

* Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula
* Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model
* Discounted Cash Flow Model

**Hypothesis**

* US next interest rates hike of 25-50bps
* Inflation of 6.5% and cooling down to 6% for January 2023
* TSLA is high volume stock
* TSLA is overvalued
* There are many TSLA bagholders
* TSLA can‚Äôt outproduce its competitors in the near nor mid term

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Methodology

The thesis used macroeconomics data from the 13th of January 2023 for its valuations, Income Statements, Balance Sheets and Cash Flow are considered and projected to the next three years. The final price tag is obtained by the average of three valuation methodology: Graham Formula, Discounted Cash Flow and Cash Flow Evaluation. It is then given a 20% margin of error in both direction.

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, three methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

&amp;#x200B;

# Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 24.40%** is determined by the average analysts consensus for the company‚Äôs next year growth rate.

&amp;#x200B;

# Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company last year‚Äôs available cash flow data, its WACC based discount rate of 12,84% and its Growth Rate of 24,40% to determine a fair value of **$78.88** per share.

&amp;#x200B;

# Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing. This thesis uses the adjusted formula to better adjust it to the current market environment.

Data used for the calculation:

|Data|Value|
|:-|:-|
| EPS | 3.24 |
| Growth Rate | 24.40 |
| AAA Bond Yield | 4.40 |

 The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$101.74** 

&amp;#x200B;

# Discounted Cash Flow Model

This thesis uses Free Cash Flow, gained by subtraction Capex from Cash floe From Operations. Free cash flow (FCF) is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|Data|Value|
|:-|:-|
| WACC based discount rate | 12.84% |
| Growth rate | 24.40% |
| Average US GDP growth rate | 3.18% |
| Average Shares outstanding | 3,157,752,000 |

Which projected a FCF for the next five years as per follow:

Note: the projection is based on the assumption the company will keep growing by a perpetual rate of 24.40%, which is highly improbable due to unknown future events and variations in the market. This shall be taken only as an indicative forecast.

The calculation gives us a Fair Value of **$70.99** per share

&amp;#x200B;

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Data|Value|
|:-|:-|
| Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model | $78,88 |
| Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula | $101.74 |
| Discounted Free Cash Flow Model | $70.99 |
| **Final Price + 20% error margin** | **$104.83** |
| **Final Fair Price (Average)** | **$83.87** |
| **Final Price - 20% error margin** | **$62.90** |

* **Tesla Model X** $109,990
* **Tesla Model 3** $43,990
* **Tesla Model Y** $52,990

We can observe a 40% increase of Unit sold in 2022.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Insider Transactions

There are heavy and frequent sell activity from insiders of the company from all departments, biggest drop of shares come from the CEO itself.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# SWOT ANALYSIS

 Strengths

* **Most Valuable Automotive Company**: It is currently the the automotive company with the highest market capitalisation.
* **Tesla Increased its Electric Vehicle Delivery**: In 2022 it increased its deliveries of 40% from 935 milion  to 1.3 billion units.
* **Cross-sell and Diversification**: Tesla has comprehensive insurance program for its vehicles in association with Liberty Mutual insurance company.
* **Innovative Company**: Tesla has a very high rate of innovation, the market expects the company to develop competitive and profitable products.

 

### Weaknesses

* **Manufacturing Complications**: Tesla faces continuous launch, manufacturing and production ramp delays while launching their new vehicles and other products. For example, Tesla faced endless manufacturing challenges when they were about to launch Model X, which lead to constant delays for distribution. Similarly, the company went through extreme troubles while manufacturing Model X‚Äôs battery module assembly line at Gigafactory 1.  
* **Unable to meet demand might affect brand value**: Due to highly experimenting and complicated procedures, Tesla‚Äô might face an unbalanced supply and demand, unable to meet the production ramp. 
* **Lack of High Volume Productio**n: It has failed to produce high volumes of automobiles for any of its models. Even now, as the company plans to manufacture Model 3 vehicles at high volume, it faces issues in terms of production cost and management resources.
* **Shortage of Batterie**s: The shortage directly affectes the sales of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.
* **Elon Musk as Tesla‚Äôs Sole Representative**: Musk is deeply involved in other projects and side quests.
* **Financial Uncertainty**: Tesla has outstanding debt of $5.38 Billion. If the company is unable to generate enough cash flow to repay its debt, then there is a risk of delaying expansion, reducing investments, selling assets, etc.
* **Employee Safety Concerns**: Tesla was recently fined in 2019 for creating a tent production line without a permit or safety inspection. Also, the company did not train workers about the risks of working in the tent for long periods under the scorching California‚Äôs heat.
* **Leadership Wrangles**: Friction and conflict between management and the board of directors can undermine productivity and long-term success. Tesla‚Äôs management and board have been engaged in several power struggles.
* **Tesla Faces Lawsuit over Sexual Misconduct**: Many Tesla workers filed a lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct and harassment at the workplace. The women have complained that the company fosters a dark culture of sexual misconduct. They also alleged that they were cat-called and were frequently subjected to shameful remarks, groping, and misogynistic behaviour.  

 

### Opportunities

* **Sales expansion in untapped Market**: The most significant opportunity for the company right now is the Asian market, even tho there are increased risks.
* **Less Expensive Car**: Tesla‚Äôs Model 3 is a more affordable version of Model S with less range, power, and fewer features.
* **Bringing battery production technology in-house**: Tesla intends to make its own battery cells. 
* **Market Confidence in Tesla**: The stock market has shown confidence in Tesla after beating the projected car deliveries.

 

### Threats

* **Product Liability Claims**: The company has faced lawsuits and claims related to the failure of technology in their products. If these liability claims continued, then Tesla may be subjected to greater financial setbacks.
* **Extensive Competition**: Tesla, Inc. faces aggressive competition from both alternative fuel vehicles (Hybrid, Plug-in hybrid, fully electric car) and self-driving technology. Many automotive brands in the luxury segment like Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lexus and in the economy segment like Toyota, Ford, General Motors , Volvo are getting ready for a fierce competition. Many brands are not only launching or planning to launch their environment-friendly-Self-driving technology but also, they are offering them at a comparably lower price. 
* **Product Defects**: Tesla‚Äôs cars and other energy products have exhibited major flaws in many cases. The defective products often have weaknesses in design, manufacturing, and other features which harm the company‚Äôs image permanently.
* **Long term confidence**: Tesla, due to its unstable manufacturing conditions, suffers from disbelief among the public about its long-term existence, which can result in a deficiency in further business development.
* **Customer Adaptation**: The company highly depends upon customers willingness to adopt electric vehicles.
* **Disruption of Supply Due to Shortage of Materials**: Tesla can face major suspensions in the supply of manufacturing materials due to the increased prices. The company uses aluminum, steel, lithium, nickel, copper, and cobalt, as well as lithium-ion cells from suppliers. All these materials have volatile prices, which can affect the company‚Äôs production line severely in the future.
* **High-Risk Factor Due to Usage of Lithium-ion**: Tesla uses lithium-ion cells in their battery packs. Lithium is a highly reactive and explosive element, which increases the risk factor of our products. Tesla has faced a a few cases where their cars have caught fire and vented smoke, which has defamed the company on a major level.
* **Elon Musk‚Äôs Behavior Affecting Tesla‚Äôs Reputation**: Tesla‚Äôs entire reputation is built upon the cult of Elon Musk. But recently, his waky behavior and impulsive reactions are affecting Tesla.
* **Competitors increasing productions of EV Vehicles**: Competitors are jumping in the EV segment eating huge portions of the market share.

The max pain options point is the strike price, where puts and calls have the most open interest.¬†

Max Pain Theory:

The max pain theory states that the stock price will gravitate towards the max pain strike price. As a result, the option sellers will hedge the contracts they sell by buying and selling shares to neutralize their position.¬†

The option sellers want their options to expire worthless, so they will attempt to buy and sell shares to drive the stock price toward a closing price that will make the option profitable and expire worthless.

***Summary of McElligott's important points below...***

&amp;#x200B;

**""Beautiful CPI print"" for the tactical 'disinflationary doves'**

* Increase in lagged 'shelter' pricing was easily offset by broader decreases in energy, food, autos et al
* Most recent trades went ""right way"" - all of the recent 'panic grab' into ""right-tail"" (rally) outcome trades from majority of clients w/o enough ""risk-on""

**USD Crushed**

**Rates -&gt; Curve explosively steepened** *to the delight of leveraged funds who desperately needed a break in the negative carry/roll trade*

**US Equities gapped higher** *before seeing rush to monetize upside option exposure which created substantial $Delta for sale on the unwind, and market consolidated intraday around the 4000 strk Gamma*

**Single Names saw duration-sensitive stocks** *- i.e., the majority of Most-shorted, lowest quality, highest leverage, highest vol/beta cause pain on explosive squeeze higher over the course of the day and YTD. Watch Meme stocks and squeeze stock stop-hunt exercises...*

&amp;#x200B;

**""Worst Shall be First, on de-grossing of shorts/adding back to nets:""**

**""Most folks just don't have enough 'risk' on due to the impulse macro regime pivot to 'disinflation' - hence said 'grab', which is being echoed in Street PB data showing substantial Week over Week jumps in net exposure (chasing the rally)""**

Fits within the theme of recent weeks -&gt; now largely flipped out of the consensus ""macro trend trades"" from 2022's FCI tightening regime (Long USD vs Short Assets), and now seeing this pure reversal OUT of dollars and back INTO assets, with bonds/equities/credit/commods now being chased into FCI-Easing trades in early 2023 from historically low exposures.

**EQUITIES &amp; INDEX VOL NOTES**

* Much discussed talking-point on the persistent ""over-realization vs implied"" on CPI event days over the past \~year finally went ""wrong-way"" as Gamma didn't pay, with the market essentially pinned thanks to the aforementioned big monetization of Upside / Call structures - largely as a function of the magnitude of the phenomenal 7.7% rally in IWM/7.3% rally in QQQ/5.0% rally in SPY over the past \~week, which incentivized locking-in of gains, aided too by the gravity of the largest $Gamma 4000 strike (SPX), and helping to offset underlying buyers who finally are sensing a macro ""green light"" to add risk back

**Equities Index/ETF Vols were smashed**

https://preview.redd.it/b0kpejbdzuba1.png?width=1257&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ae221755870ef4f04f83f7ed669e23faabd0238a

* Overwriters snapped up the opportunity to lay into historically ""rich"" upside/Call skews and sold optionality - *YTD, seeing this increased confidence (and positive returns again) from options selling strats in general, after a rough 2022*
* Tail strategies continue to underwhelm despite this constant ""wall of worry"", bc we are seeing the macro 'worst case scenario' left-tail distribution of outcomes get cut/repriced lower and the ""good"" outcome of the ""transitory goldilocks""/""soft landing"" picking up delta
   * ""Immaculate disinflation"" in US looking outright ""transitory"" again, as Fed ""over-tightening accident"" risk passes with terminal rate projections off the boil and ""pause"" well in-sight
   * US economic growth holding firm, led by still-strong labor &amp; services
   * China ZCS being lifted, with reopening providing a boost for the global economy and pushing back ""global recession"" fears
   * Deep European recession viewed as avoided thanks to the energy crisis cooling
   * Ukraine/Russia relatively stable

***It has been a short-delta, short-skew trade for most of the past year, bc as global CBs were forced into an impulse tightening to crush demand-side inflation through tighter financial conditions, it's been a ""slow, grinding, controlled demolition"" of legacy risk/asset exposures.***

In turn, said ""grinding"" de-grossing of exposures, in the case of equities, meant a ""crashless"" selloff - very orderly, in fact, which by the second half of 2022 meant that Skew and Put Skew were at historically LOW levels as there was simply not enough exposure on to require ""crashy"" downside hedges.

Instead it meant that all the ""crash"" protection demand was for RIGHT TAIL upside trades, hence 100%ile/upper90%ile SPX Call Skew rankings over the back part of last year into the start of this year... because nobody had the underlying exposure -&gt; in case the macro data/narrative allowed for a shift in the ""FCI Tightening"" regime

Finally beginning to see signs of Skew/Put Skew firming as investors starting to require hedging again!

**CTA POSITIONING ESTIMATES &amp; EXPOSURES**

Aggregated Net Global Equities Exposure in the CTA model is now back to highs / ""Longest"" since Jan 6th 2022, where the massive ""Short USD"" trade expression into ""Rest of World"" Equities Longs being established on ""Past Peak Inflation = Past Peak Fed"" ironically sees the former decade-long high-flyer Nasdaq (Duration-sensitive of course) as the last remaining ""major"" full-tilt ""Long"" holdout from being all the way back in a ""+100% Long"" signal seen across 11 of the 13 total futures tracked.

For Stocks:

A point is simply equal to a one-dollar movement.

For Indexes:

A point change in a stock index such as the S&amp;P 500 is still a $1 move in the index, but the point changes result from stocks within the index increasing and decreasing in value.¬†

It is much easier to say that the index is up 100 points rather than the stocks within it are up $700m. Points in a stock index make analyzing the change in the value of the index as a whole easier than analyzing the increase of each company.

#[Dow futures fall more than 200 points as bank shares decline on recession fears](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; The stock market was set to end a winning week on a sour note as JPMorgan Chase led a decline in bank shares after it warned a recession was its base case for the year.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 200 points, or 0.6%, while S&amp;P 500 futures slid 0.7%. Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.8%.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan Chase posted revenue that beat expectations, but the bank warned it was setting aside more money to cover credit losses because a ‚Äúmild recession‚Äù is its ‚Äúcentral case.‚Äù The bank posted a $2.3 billion provision for credit losses in the quarter, a 49% increase from the third quarter. The stock fell more than 2%.
*****
&gt; Wells Fargo shares fell 2% after the bank reported its quarterly figures. Bank of America also fell 2% premarket despite reporting better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter.
*****
&gt; Delta Air Lines also reported earnings and revenue that beat estimates for the final quarter of 2022. However, the stock slid more than 5% in the premarket.
*****
&gt; Investors have been awaiting these results to gain more insight into the health of the economy.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúAs the tug-of-war among analysts intensifies around the prospects for a recession ‚Äî and the depth of a recession ‚Äî the earnings reports from the banks, coupled with their guidance, should help clarify how businesses and consumers are managing,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, LPL Financial‚Äôs chief global strategist.
*****
&gt; The moves followed a positive day for the three major indexes. The Nasdaq Composite snatched its fifth day of gains ‚Äî a first since July. Stocks rose broadly as December‚Äôs CPI report showed prices declined 0.1% over November. While prices rose at a 6.5% pace compared to the previous year, the results heightened hopes that the Federal Reserve may soon slow its hiking.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 216.96 points, or 0.64%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 0.34% and 0.64%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Stocks are headed for a winning week, with the Nasdaq and S&amp;P on pace for their best weekly performance since November. The Nasdaq is up 4.09% through Thursday‚Äôs close. The S&amp;P has advanced 2.26%, while the Dow has added 1.66%.

1734,StockMarket,"CLOVERDALE, CA / ACCESSWIRE / January 10, 2023 / Cann American Corp. (OTC PINK: CNNA ), the ""Company"", a holding company building a diverse portfolio of intellectual properties, is pleased to announce a shareholder update for 2023.

On October 31, 2022, the Company entered into an asset purchase and change of control with a gaming and technology company. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the parties agreed, mutually, to unwind that deal and return the parties to as they were prior to the agreement.

However, current management has decided to proceed with efforts to up list the Company to SEC reporting and continues to engage its audit firm in that process. The Company strongly believes this commitment to increased shareholder value should be honored and is actively doing so.

Secondly, the Company will continue to enact significant debt restructuring with its note holder for the sake of preserving its capital structure. The Company does not expect the current O/S to increase but believes there will be a significant decrease in shares outstanding soon.

Additionally, Cann American has engaged in a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), with a company in an approximate $12 billion-dollar biopharmaceutical sector. The proposed agreement would result in the target company becoming a wholly owned subsidiary requiring new Officers, Directors, and possibly Independent Directors as well.

The Company believes this acquisition is much better suited for Cann American than the previous gaming deal. Though this agreement is still outside of Cann American's current cannabis and hemp related assets, the acquisition would still compliment those assets by allowing Cann American to expand as a holding company focused on a wider range of therapeutic needs. The Company anticipates a quick transition with specifics about the target company to be released in the coming days.

Stated Cann American CEO, Jason Black: ""Sometimes what appears to be a setback is a blessing in disguise. Though, I was disappointed that the Mark2 deal wouldn't proceed after so much effort had gone into it, the current acquisition target is much more appealing from an industry and revenue standpoint that I believe shareholders will be much happier in the direction the Company is headed.""",Cann America Corp. provides updates on current deals and progress.,1673614391

1753,StockMarket,"Data on Thursday showed that U.S. consumer price index inflation fell as expected in December, putting less onus on the Federal Reserve to keep hiking interest rates at a sharp clip.

The trend is likely to result in lesser pressure on risk-heavy Asian markets this year. Traders are now pricing in a nearly 95% chance `the Fed` will hike rates by a relatively smaller 25 basis points in February.

But while interest rates are expected to peak this year, markets are also wary of a potential recession, especially as the effects of tight monetary policy become more pronounced. Slowing growth in major economies could bode poorly for sentiment toward risk-driven markets.

1754,StockMarket,"Apple is cutting Tim Cook‚Äôs compensation by over 40% to $49 million in 2023. This $49 million pay consists of $3 million base salary, $6 million bonus, and $40 million stock awards. Within that $40 million stock awards, $30 million will be dependent on AAPL share performance. If AAPL share hits performance thresholds, the $30 million will be doubled to at least $60 million. Therefore, in the best scenario, Cook could get over $79 million pay in 2023.

Despite the poor performance of AAPL, the compensation Cook received in 2022 was $99.4 million which includes $3 million base salary and over $83 million stock awards and bonus. The pay in 2022 was higher than the $98.7 million pay in 2021.

Comparing with other executives, Cook‚Äôs compensation is way higher. CFO Luca Maestri, General Counsel Kate Adams, retail chief Deidre O‚ÄôBrien and COO Jeff Williams are all paid about $27 million total in 2022.

This is incredible, why Cook could get such a high pay even after AAPL sucked for the whole year, plunged 25% compare with one year before. Apple should have added that stock performance requirements on Cook‚Äôs stock awards earlier.

1765,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**: Today's move higher saw our first pierce of the bear channel celing, courtesy of IWM.  With the upcoming long weekend, I expect volume will be light tomorrow which may cause price to drift higher, sending SPY above the bear channel as our second major index to do so.  That said, I am still in the bearish camp, as on the macro time frame everything we are seeing is occuring at the lower range of the down move we saw over the entire couse of 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**:  Price tagged the 200 DMA before pulling back.  Major resistance remains immediately overhead at 399.40 to 401.35.  Given the potential breakout of the bear channel in the IWM chart, I could see price floating through those levels tomorrow on light, pre-long weekend volume.  If price reverses, then 387.41 flag's top will offer some support, with major support at 382 ascending TL through the former bear flag.  Antoher major support level is at 374.77 flag's bottom (bolstered by 374.13 gap-fill just below). 

https://preview.redd.it/uxqapc34kqba1.jpg?width=2314&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2c94d021ca3315c3734fed7e650d9aa6e5ebfc1b

**QQQ:** By comparison from a technical perspective, a 'quiet' day, but today's close did officially turn 274.78 into a support level -- and it is also being bolstered by an ascending TL.  The first major support is 259.08 flag's bottom &amp; previous pivot low, followed by an even more major level at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.  Nearest resistance remains the 282.33 gap-window, with major resistance at 286.51 gap-fill and 288.50 descending TL channel ceiling. 

https://preview.redd.it/znqp5b3fjqba1.jpg?width=2315&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=682633e350304a1289dfcba9ec159c6de52dc5b4

**IWM:** Yet again a leading indicator, price punched through &amp; closed above the bear channel.  Price must close above 185.95 before dipping back into the channel to officially turn the TL into a support level.  Given the coming holiday weekend, I would not be surprised to see price float into the 188 - 190 resistance level tomorrow. If price reverses, then 180.19 is nearest support, followed by 176.80.  The first major support level is that ascending TL cutting through the former bear flag.

**Thesis**: I entered this trade a while ago, yet failed to ever add to the position (hindsight is always 20/20).  I had just recently planned to transition this swing trade into an investment position, at which point I would've begun writing covered calls against it to chip away at my average price.  Put this morning's pop sent the trade in the money...I set a stop at 65.10 thinking it would give price the ability to consolidate for another leg higher...but I ultimately got stopped out.  Seeing how this had traded as low as $51 recently, I am more than happy to take even the smallest win here.

**Short Price**: 6.00  
**Short Size**: 1%  
**Thesis**: Big run up here as BTC broke $19,000.  I am using TA across both the RIOT and BTC charts for this trade, as both are hitting major resistance levels.  My target for this trade is $5 - $5.15, which corresponds to the previous pivot high as well as a 38.2% Fib retrace of this move.  I will add another tranche to this position at 7.28 next pivot high, which is also where the 200 DMA is coming down into.

1772,StockMarket,"‚ÄòDespite the tighter policy and slower growth over the past year, we have not seen clear progress on slowing inflation.‚Äô \[1\] As J Powell addressed the Brookings Institute in November, it was clear that 2022 was a turbulent year for the Fed, emphasized by their inability to deal with rampant inflation; a result of the global energy crisis caused by the Ukrainian war, a global food supply crisis, and the rapid money supply increase since the COVID pandemic (in the last two years, the Fed allowed the M2 money supply to increase by approximately 40% \[2\]). On the global stage, economic growth slumped from 6% in 2021 to 3.2% in 2022 \[3\]; a result of monetary tightening across the board, the long tail of the COVID pandemic, and the cost of living crisis. The end of the year was topped off with the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX and a loss of investor confidence in the crypto markets. Private markets didn‚Äôt fare much better with deal activity and value on Carta dropping every quarter \[4\], exacerbated by the ballooning valuations in 2021.

# So what asset classes fared better than others in 2022?

It‚Äôs not surprising that commodities (DBC) generated **19.3%** in cumulative returns in 2022 given the macroeconomic factors at play. Managed futures also saw over **17.2%** cumulative return in 2022. On the other hand, the FED‚Äôs continual interest rates hikes hit long term treasury bonds hard. 20 plus year treasury bonds (TLT) and 7-10 year treasury bonds (IEF) both saw a drop **over 15%** in cumulative return. It wasn‚Äôt a good year for REITS either with VNQ dropping **over 25%** in cumulative return.

# How did asset class performance correlate with each other?

In 2022, stocks and bonds moved together (against historical wisdom), with a correlation of 0.32 between SPY and AGG, although the strength of the correlation weakened with longer term bonds 0.19 (IEF) and 0.08 (TLT). As interest rates rose and economic growth dampened in 2022, both stocks and bonds were pushed down.

[Safety in Sin Stocks](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/6lLWbBtodpMpQjZlP1Od/details) (a symphony investing in the likes of defense and entertainment) showed weak correlation of 0.44 with [Hedgefundie‚Äôs Excellent Adventure Refined](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/GRJDa5zW93bZJwPDijdu/details) (a risk on/off symphony investing in leveraged equity/bond positions or safe havens) and 0.42 with [The Not Boring: Rising Rates with Vol Switch](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/GgJ8sChXZn6IXmiylDNw/details) (a risk on/off symphony navigating the rising rates environment). While Safety in Sin Stocks can potentially hold a combination of alternative ETF‚Äôs such as US Aerospace &amp; Defense (BATS), US Energy (ARCX), and Esports (XNAS), the Hedgefundie and Not Boring symphonies both switch across more traditional bond, gold, and US index fund ETFs.

Meanwhile, the[ Dragon Portfolio](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/vWMM10oxpSNOXY6vPuJ6/details) (based on the Artemis Dragon Portfolio) showed a very strong correlation of 0.95 with [The Dalio](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/6oGqcHPz8hb9s93lIeD2/details) (all-weather strategy developed by Ray Dalio) and [Golden Butterfly](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/7k87CXDkH0QCPHz5Infu/details) (inspired by the popular equal-weight portfolio combining stocks, short- and long-term Treasuries, and gold). All three of these portfolio‚Äôs hold long term treasury bonds, gold, and some form of commodity which can explain the correlation strength (although the Dragon Portfolio is more internationally focussed).

[Buy the Dips: Nasdaq 100](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/ltYJfAbjNyUjIrA2TQyS/details) clearly outperformed all other symphonies in 2022 with a cumulative return of **32.2%**. We believe the logic of this mean reversion symphony had good timing with dips in the market and was further emphasized by the number of opportunities that the symphony was able to enter TQQQ in 2022. [Crude Reality: The Smarter Oil Playbook](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/aw42jPNspqEl3RklAoPe/details) also showed strong performance with a cumulative return of **17.8%** (driven by a rally in the DBO oil fund ETF from February to June following the Russian invasion in Ukraine).

In 2022, SPY had a negative sharpe ratio of -0.74. On Composer‚Äôs platform, the [Volatility Hedge](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/0dKcj7cKmeHhafQKlrHM/details) symphony had the highest Sharpe ratio in 2022 at just over 1.2. Given the inflationary environment, [Stoic Finance Presents: Inflation Spiral Hedge](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/c1bWgoNRaiff8ZZwBGD0/details) also had a strong sharpe ratio.

SQQQ and SOXS represent the most bought ETFs on Composer‚Äôs platform while XLRE and DPST represent the most sold ETFs. Overall, investors moved into leveraged shorts on the Nasdaq and semiconductor industry, as well as short term bonds.

The risk on aspect of this symphony weighs 55% towards UPRO (3x leveraged daily exposure to large and mid sized US companies) and 45% towards TMF (3x leveraged daily exposure to an index of 20 year plus US treasury bonds). [Volatility Hedge](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/0dKcj7cKmeHhafQKlrHM/details) was the least risky symphony in 2022 focussing only on Gold and the US dollar.

[Volatility Hedge](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/0dKcj7cKmeHhafQKlrHM/details) had the lowest maximum drawdown of 2.75% in 2022 as a result of holding safe haven assets (gold and US dollar). [Tactical Asset Allocator](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/kULEdknQwUoefsGpQKsT/details) was not far behind with a 5.59% maximum drawdown in 2022.

# Looking ahead to 2023

2022 was marked by rising inflation, an energy crisis, and a slowdown in economic growth. In this macroeconomic environment, commodities, safe haven assets, and long term bond shorts all showed strong performance. On the Composer platform, users were able to build smart logic driven strategies to capitalize on these asset classes. [Crude Reality: The Smarter Oil Playbook ](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/aw42jPNspqEl3RklAoPe/details)(utilizing commodity ETF logic) showed a cumulative return of 17.8%. Elsewhere, Composer users managed to minimize their risk systematically through the [Volatility Hedge](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/0dKcj7cKmeHhafQKlrHM/details) symphony, shifting assets to US dollar and gold.

Looking ahead in 2023, the Fed will hope they can push inflation back to their 2% target, most likely at the expense of a further slowdown in economic growth.

1787,StockMarket,"Within just 3 months, Miami-based primary care centers operator Cano Health Inc. (NASDAQ: CANO) changed its appearance from an attractive M&amp;A target to a going concern story, takeover rumors were replaced by rumors of financial insolvency, and one of the largest stockholders sold out its position.

***M&amp;A Rumors Episode¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠***

On September 22, 2022, Cano stock surged 32% after the Wall Street Journal reported that CVS HealthCorp. (NYSE: CVS) and Humana Inc. (NASDAQ: HUM) were in talks to buy out Cano Health which focuses on senior primary healthcare and has 151 facilities across California, Florida, Texas, New Mexico, Nevada, and Puerto Rico. Cano‚Äôs stock price surged to $9.64 by early October following the reports that CVS was in exclusive talks to purchase the healthcare provider.

In mid-October, however, Dealreporter leaked that CVS walked away from a potential acquisition of the senior-care facility operator after which the Company‚Äôs shares plunged by over 40%.

There's been no solid news about the matter until January 10, when reports said that CVS is exploring an acquisition of Oak Street Health for more than $10 billion. Now Cano‚Äôs investors are left wondering if there was a Cano deal on the table at all and if the deal was indeed planned, whether it fell apart due to the high offer price, or because of the hidden issues that were revealed during the due diligence process.

***Going Concern Scene***

Cano dived deeper, erasing another 35% of the market cap after issuing a second consecutive guidance cut along with weak Q3 financial results on November 10, 2022. Although revenue and total membership were up 33% and 40% year-over-year respectively, the company reduced its expectations for the annual revenue, EBITDA, and medical centers numbers forecast.

Investors and analysts were concerned that the Company lost $112 million in the quarter and reported only $24 million in cash, compared to $163.2 million in Q3 2021. Multiple equity analysts cut their ratings and S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded its credit grade to B-, citing Cano‚Äôs weak credit measures that leave it with little room to outperform.

It remains unclear to Investors why the Company's management, the Board of Directors, and activist shareholders did not take all the necessary steps to ensure the financial stability of the Company.

***Stock Sell-Off Culmination***

On December 7, 2022, Bloomberg reported that Daniel Loeb‚Äôs Third Point LLC sold its entire stake in Cano amid mounting concerns about the healthcare provider‚Äôs liquidity and that some of Cano‚Äôs biggest creditors are in the early stage of organizing ahead of potential debt restructuring discussions. Earlier a NY-based asset management company had already disclosed a decreased stake of 3.5% in October, down from 6.4% in March.

Looking back at the events of 2022, Loeb was the first to push Cano for a sale process in March, followed in August by the letter from Owl Creek Asset Management to Cano Health Board of Directors, strongly encouraging them to seek a strategic buyer. Both investors believed that following the SPAC deal backed by billionaire Barry Sternlicht by which the company went public, Cano Health was underperforming compared to its market peers.

Now investors are left to guess whether Third Point‚Äôs exit is a sign of the absence of any prospects in the investment story or disagreement with the actions of the Company's management.

During all these events, Cano's shares managed to at first soar by 50% on M&amp;A rumors, to then fall over 85% on liquidity concerns. The most remarkable thing is that all this occurred within just 3 months during which both long and short investors experienced significant depreciations of their positions.

A straddle and a strangle are similar in that they are both options trading strategies that involve holding a long position (a ""call option"") and a short position (a ""put option"") on the same underlying asset. The important difference between the two is the strike prices of the options. 

&amp;#x200B;

Straddle:

In a straddle, the strike prices of the call and put options are the same. This means that if the underlying stock price moves significantly in either direction, the investor can make a profit by exercising one of the options (either the call or the put) and offsetting the loss on the other option. 

Strangle:

In a strangle, the strike prices of the call and put options are different. The call option has a higher strike price, and the put option has a lower strike price. This means that the strangle allows for a greater range of underlying stock prices at expiration in which the options will be in the money, and the investor can make a profit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Straddle vs. Strangle:

Both straddle and strangle strategies are considered to be high-risk, high-reward strategies, and they are not suitable for all investors. It's important to have a solid understanding of options trading and the underlying asset before engaging in these strategies and also to be aware of the risks and costs involved. Straddle is considered to be riskier than strangle because, with a straddle, the investor has to pay a higher premium than with strangle.

# [Stock futures rise slightly in runup to key inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/11/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures advanced Thursday as investors awaited a key inflation report to assess the outlook for the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate-hiking campaign.
*****
&gt; Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 87 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.3%, while Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.2%.
*****
&gt; All eyes are on December‚Äôs consumer price index reading with the consensus forecast calling for a slight easing in price pressures.
*****
&gt; Economists expect the consumer price index to dip 0.1% for December but rise 6.5% year-over-year, compared to a 0.1% monthly gain in November and an annual pace of 7.1%, according to Dow Jones. The CPI is well off the 9.1% peak rate in June.
*****
&gt; Excluding food and energy prices, economists expect the CPI for December will be 0.3% higher than the prior month and 5.7% higher than a year ago.

&gt; ‚ÄúInflation should continue to decline, leading to an end to Fed rate hikes this spring, keeping interest rates in check, and buoying corporate profits,‚Äù Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, said in a note.
*****
&gt; Stocks rallied Wednesday ahead of the inflation report as investors bet that the Fed could slow down its rate hikes in light of tamer prices. The Dow climbed more than 260 points, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 1.3% with all 11 sectors ending the day higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.8% Wednesday, notching a four-day streak.

Netflix had the kind of year in 2022 that only the ghoulishly morbid [Wednesday Addams](http://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/entertainment/wednesday-addams-family-jenna-ortega/index.html) would love. But, now, in part due to a sagging dollar, the picture is getting brighter.

Netflix [(NFLX)](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=NFLX&amp;source=story_quote_link) shares plunged more than 50% last year due to [concerns](http://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/investing/media-stocks-outlook/index.html) about streaming subscription fatigue, increased competition from the likes of Disney [(DIS)](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=DIS&amp;source=story_quote_link), Apple [(AAPL)](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AAPL&amp;source=story_quote_link), Amazon [(AMZN)](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AMZN&amp;source=story_quote_link), Comcast‚Äôs [(CMCSA)](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=CMCSA&amp;source=story_quote_link) Peacock, [Paramount](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=PARA) and CNN and HBO owner [Warner Bros.

But as this year begins, Netflix is enjoying a solid rebound. The stock is up about 10% already in 2023, a surge that‚Äôs grabbing Wall Street‚Äôs attention ahead of the streamer‚Äôs fourth-quarter earnings release next week. 

One possible reason for the recent turnaround? The suddenly weaker dollar could be giving it a boost.

The US Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback versus the euro, yen and several other leading global currencies, is down slightly this year and is off more than 10% from its 52-week high last September. The US Dollar Index rose almost 10% in 2022‚Ä¶a [historically large move](http://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html) in the normally stable world of foreign exchange.

Netflix generated nearly 60% of its revenue from outside the United States in the third quarter. So anytime the dollar loses value, that boosts sales and earnings for a multinational company like Netflix once those international results are translated back into dollars.",Netflix stock soars on the dollar‚Äôs slide,1673509698

Netflix [(NFLX)](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=NFLX&amp;source=story_quote_link) shares plunged more than 50% last year due to [concerns](http://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/investing/media-stocks-outlook/index.html) about streaming subscription fatigue, increased competition from the likes of Disney [(DIS)](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=DIS&amp;source=story_quote_link), Apple [(AAPL)](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AAPL&amp;source=story_quote_link), Amazon [(AMZN)](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AMZN&amp;source=story_quote_link), Comcast‚Äôs [(CMCSA)](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=CMCSA&amp;source=story_quote_link) Peacock, [Paramount](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=PARA) and CNN and HBO owner [Warner Bros. Discovery](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=WBD), along with questions about whether Netflix [(NFLX)](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=NFLX&amp;source=story_quote_link)‚Äôs new [advertising-supported option](https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/media/netflix-ads-plan-cost/index.html) would help or hurt it.

But as this year begins, Netflix is enjoying a solid rebound. The stock is up about 10% already in 2023, a surge that‚Äôs grabbing Wall Street‚Äôs attention ahead of the streamer‚Äôs fourth-quarter earnings release next week. 

One possible reason for the recent turnaround? The suddenly weaker dollar could be giving it a boost.

The US Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback versus the euro, yen and several other leading global currencies, is down slightly this year and is off more than 10% from its 52-week high last September. The US Dollar Index rose almost 10% in 2022‚Ä¶a [historically large move](http://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html) in the normally stable world of foreign exchange.

Netflix generated nearly 60% of its revenue from outside the United States in the third quarter. So anytime the dollar loses value, that boosts sales and earnings for a multinational company like Netflix once those international results are translated back into dollars.",Netflix stock soars on the dollar‚Äôs slide,1673509640

1854,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**:  Another really good push higher across each index today, with QQQ finally joining the breakout party.  All eyes on the CPI data tomorrow, as it could take price up into (through?) the bear channel's ceiling, which could complete this current up-move and set us up for a pullback next week.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**: Another great move as SPY nears the gap-fill and channel ceiling, which should provide major resistance at 399.40 to 401.75 especially with the 200 DMA also in the mix now.  If price reverses on the CPI data tomorrow morning, then 387.41 flag's top and 381.35 ascending TL through the former bear flag are not officially support levels.  Major support will come form 374.77 flag's bottom (bolstered by 374.13 gap-fill just below).

https://preview.redd.it/53a85bcuoiba1.jpg?width=2313&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=659fe7d169e998434a9b4fc65dec1a6fb4768b65

**QQQ:** Finally joined its other indexes with an official breakout today -- and by comparison, tech still have so much more room to go before reaching its channel ceiling.  Nearest resistance is 282.33 gap-window, with major resistance at 286.51 gap-fill and 288.15descending TL channel ceiling. If price fails on the CPI data tomorrow morning, the 274.78 and 273 will offer some support, but the first major support is 259.08 flag's bottom &amp; previous pivot low, followed by an even more major level at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th. 

https://preview.redd.it/qvgkarimniba1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=93efdece24386508d1513911defa49c726af5964

**IWM:** Another solid move today, validating the breakout through the gap-window which now also turns 180.19 into a support level.  The channel ceiling at 183.50 is major support and a tag/pierce of this level would complete this cycle.  If price can get above the channel then 188 - 190 will provide resistance from the multiple pivot highs at the end of 2022.  If price reverses off the CPI data tomorrow morning, then 180.19 and 176.80 are officially support levels now, as is the ascending TL cutting through what was one a bear flag.  Major suspport would be a return to the 170.67 flag's bottom coupled by 169.11 the pre-COVID high.

Taxes on futures come with more benefits than equity due to the section 1256 tax code.¬†

As a result of the IRS categorization of markets like futures under Section 1256, the calculation of capital gains and losses is based on a 60% long-term and 40% short-term ratio.

The same rules apply to futures options and index options.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Wash Sales:

Futures trading is not subject to the wash sale rule.

The wash sale rule is a tax rule that prohibits individuals from claiming a loss on the sale of a security if they repurchase the same or substantially similar security within 30 days before or after the sale.¬†

# [Stock futures rise after Nasdaq‚Äôs third straight winning day](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Wednesday as Wall Street looked to build on what has been a positive start to 2023 so far.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 94 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each gained 0.3%.
*****
&gt; The moves come after the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.01% on Tuesday to clinch its first three-day winning streak since November. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow rose 0.70% and 0.56%, respectively, and all three averages are positive for the young year.
*****
&gt; 2023 has brought a relief rally so far for more risky areas of the market, such as tech, but many investors are still cautious ahead of earnings season and further expected rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think it is going to be a challenge to try to time when the Fed will ultimately start to cut rates,‚Äù said Matthew Palazzolo, senior investment strategist at Bernstein Private Wealth Management. ‚ÄúThere is some evidence that when rates start to decline from the Federal Reserve, better markets are ahead. But whether that ends up being in 2024 or late 2023, at least at this point in time, sitting the middle of January, it‚Äôs just too difficult a situation.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Wednesday features a light schedule for economic data, but investors will be gearing up for a key inflation report on Thursday and major bank earnings on Friday.

1906,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**: SPY and IWM saw official breakouts of their flag patterns, which QQQ put in a potential breakout candle as well.  Probabilities therefore favor a move to the ceiling of the descending channel now, which would complete this 'cycle' of the move and set us up nicely for a pullback to test the October 2022 lows.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**: Despite price remaining within yesterday's candle, today's close officially validated the breakout from the bear flag -- giving the second half of the week a positive bias.  Price will see resistance at 394.30 gap-window, with major resistance at 399.40 gap fill (where the 200 DMA sits just below).  I would like to see a move to 402 descending TL channel ceiling to complete this cycle of the move before we head lower.  If price consolidates above what is now a support level -- 389.25 flag's top -- then we could see the gap-fill and channel ceiling converege around next week...which is all too conveinent given the economic data coming next week.  If price fails, then flag top is officiall a support level now, with more moderate support coming from 381 ascending TL within the bear flag.  Major support remains 374.77 flag's bottom (bolstered by 374.13 gap-fill just below).  Beneath the flag, there are major support levels at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note) and 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low.

https://preview.redd.it/759sjlq45cba1.jpg?width=2308&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6f47b9a573ef1081658de57197b2b68418ac2df6

**QQQ:**  Potential breakout through the ascending TL with today's close.  Price must close above 272.94 before closing back down beneath that TL.  There is immediate resistance directly above this level at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st, which will make the bull's job difficult.  If price can get through, 282.33 will offer some resistance, but major resistance will be 286.51 gap-fill and 289.50 descending TL channel ceiling.  If price fails, nearest support is 259.08 flag's bottom &amp; previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.

https://preview.redd.it/18gtcse74cba1.jpg?width=2317&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8bd039aa9b2fbefbb6aa393fe9bc8b60b4b3c28d

**IWM:** The break out of the bear flag is official, which makes 176.80 flag's top a support level now.  Price also closed above the 180.19 gap-fill, making this a pretty big day from a technical perspective.  Price must close above 180.62 before closing back inside the gap to make the gap itself a support level.  While this gives a positive bias heading into the second half of the week, there remains a lot of resistance overhead.  182 is 200 DMA, but more significant is 183.72 the channel's descending TL ceiling.  To me, this remains max upside before we head lower, but I would like to see the ceiling tagged just so we can close out this cycle of the move.  When price returns back into the the flag, the 173.71 ascending TL will offer moderate support; otherwise, 170.67 flag's bottom coupled by 169.11 the pre-COVID high is major support. And of course, 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows should also generate a sizable bounce.

**I executed 2x trades today: 1x long and 1x short:**

**Type**: Buy to Open  
**Symbol**: CVS  
**Entry Price**: 90.00  
**Entry Size**: 1%  
**Thesis**: Price fell to a major support TL datng back to late 2020, as well as the $90 whole number.  This trade triggered off a GTC+ limit order; had I been able to pay more attention during the intraday, I may have gotten a better entry as price pierced through that support TL to hit double bottom from mid-June 2022.  The fact price recovered so quickly today is reassuring, but I am ready to add another tranche at $86 double bottom from mid-October 2022.  My first target is 97.50 which is the 200 DMA as well as gap-fill, with a secondary target being around 104 a descending resistance TL if you connect the 4x pivot hights in 2022.

**Type**: Short to Enter  
**Symbol**: BSX  
**Entry Price**: 46.10  
**Entry Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**: I have been watching this trade for a week now, and entered on the 16th day of what is now a sizeable bear flag from early December 2022, as price may be slowly rolling over.  I would like to add another tranche to a 1% or 1.5% on a move up to 47.50 or 48.  My target is 41 (ascending TL connecting 4x pivot lows) to 41.50 (200 DMA).

BOA also added that before its previous lows, the S&amp;P 500 was trading below its forward multiple, below the normalized trailing multiple and below the median future multiple, but now it is actually above these three measures. The strategist noted that when you look at the difference between the situation in the stock market and the situation in the bond market, the issue of pricing is even clearer.

1945,StockMarket,"What is a stock split?  


A stock split is when corporate decides to increase the number of outstanding shares by issuing more shares to stockholders.

Even though more shares are given to shareholders, the total value remains the same since the share price will also drop.¬†Like a pizza, there might be more slices but its the same pizza.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the point?  


A couple of reasons,  psychologically a lower-priced stock looks more affordable to retail investors.  Additionally, many retail investors may not be able to purchase fractional shares, so a $1,000 stock may not be accessible to all investors. However, if the company has a stock split and the share price drops to $200 per share, more retail investors can invest in the company.¬† 

&amp;#x200B;

Traditional stock splits -  when a company increases the number of outstanding shares to decrease its share price.¬† 

Reverse -  when a company reduces its number of outstanding shares. The best way to visualize this is if you took a pizza with 24 slices and combined them, so there are only 12 slices. The total size of the pizza remains the same, but each piece is worth more.¬† Generally only happens when the price goes so low that the company wants to artificially make it higher, not the best sign for a company.

1950,StockMarket,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday stressed the need for the central bank to be free of political influence while it tackles persistently high inflation.

In a speech delivered to Sweden‚Äôs Riksbank, Powell noted that stabilizing prices requires making tough decisions that can be unpopular politically.

‚ÄúPrice stability is the bedrock of a healthy economy and provides the public with immeasurable benefits over time. But restoring price stability when inflation is high can require measures that are not popular in the short term as we raise interest rates to slow the economy,‚Äù the chair said in prepared remarks.

‚ÄúThe absence of direct political control over our decisions allows us to take these necessary measures without considering short-term political factors,‚Äù he added.

Powell‚Äôs remarks came at a forum to discuss central bank independence, and were to be followed by a question-and-answer session.

The speech did not contain any direct clues about where policy is ahead for a Fed that raised interest rates seven times in 2022, for a total of 4.25 percentage points, and has indicated that more increases likely are on the way this year.

While criticism of Fed actions by elected leaders is often done in quieter tones, the Powell Fed has faced vocal opposition from both sides of the political aisle.

Former President Donald Trump ripped the central bank when it was raising rates during his administration, while progressive leaders such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have criticized the current round of hikes. President Joe Biden has largely resisted commenting on Fed moves while noting that it is primarily the central bank‚Äôs responsibility to tackle inflation.

Powell has repeatedly stressed that political factors have not weighed on his actions.

In another part of Tuesday‚Äôs speech, he addressed calls from some lawmakers for the Fed to use its regulatory powers to address climate change. Powell noted that the Fed should ‚Äústick to our knitting and not wander off to pursue perceived social benefits that are not tightly linked to our statutory goals and authorities.‚Äù

While the Fed has asked big banks to examine their financial readiness in case of major climate-related events such as hurricanes and floods, Powell said that‚Äôs as far as it should go.

‚ÄúDecisions about policies to directly address climate change should be made by the elected branches of government and thus reflect the public‚Äôs will as expressed through elections,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut without explicit congressional legislation, it would be inappropriate for us to use our monetary policy or supervisory tools to promote a greener economy or to achieve other climate-based goals. We are not, and will not be, a ‚Äòclimate policymaker.‚Äô‚Äù

The Fed this year will, however, launch a pilot program that calls for the nation‚Äôs six biggest banks to take part in a ‚Äúscenario analysis‚Äù aimed at testing institutions‚Äô stability in the event of major climate events.

The exercise will take place apart from the so-called stress tests that the Fed uses to test how banks would fare under hypothetical economic downturns. Participating institutions are Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.

1956,StockMarket,"U.S. equities could face a sharper-than-expected selloff in 2023 from a recession shock that pushes stocks down another 22% from the current levels, according to Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Michael Wilson.

The chief equity strategist, who correctly predicted the 2022 stock-market selloff, which saw all three major indexes cement their worst annual losses since 2008, suggested on Monday that the S&amp;P 500 SPX, -0.08% could find a bottom around 3,000 points by the end of 2023. The index was trading around 3,919 at last check, according to FactSet.

Market consensus currently suggests the U.S. economy will experience a mild recession starting in the first half of 2023, followed by a recovery in the second half as the Federal Reserve is expected to stop its rate hikes and possibly cut rates in response to the worsening economic conditions.

However, Morgan Stanley‚Äôs strategists led by Wilson said that the Equity Risk Premium (ERP) for stocks, or excess returns investors could receive for holding stocks over risk-free assets, remains ‚Äúway too low given the high earnings risk,‚Äù while corporate earnings forecasts for 2023 are ‚Äúmaterially too high.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen a recession arrives, the ERP always rises significantly from whatever level you are starting at. In other words, if you think a mild recession is coming, you cannot assume the market has priced it given the ERP is at its lowest level since the run up to the Great Financial Crisis in 2008,‚Äù strategists said.

Morgan Stanley‚Äôs 2023 base case forecast for S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) of $195, while their bear case forecast is $180. EPS refers to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding, and could indicate how much money a company makes for each share of stock. However, most of the bank‚Äôs clients are in the camp that the S&amp;P 500 EPS won‚Äôt be as bad as its equity strategists think, with the team pegging the average client estimating a ratio around $210 to $215.¬†

‚ÄúFalling demand from higher interest rates and higher prices and payback from the pull-forward during COVID is happening just as supply is catching up to these formerly well-above trend levels of consumption,‚Äù Wilson said in the note. ‚ÄúThat combination has already caught many companies off guard who are unable to reverse the rising costs fast enough. The result has been disappointing margins relative to expectations, and we don‚Äôt think that reset is near completion.‚Äù

That is why a 3,500-3,600 S&amp;P 500 range is not consistent with the consensus view for a mild recession, said Wilson and his team. ‚ÄúThe consensus might be right directionally, but wrong in terms of magnitude‚Ä¶ We think it‚Äôs in the magnitude of the move lower led by much weaker earnings and a Fed committed to fighting inflation, making 3,900 an easy sale.‚Äù¬†

Wilson, one of Wall Street‚Äôs most vocal bears, isn‚Äôt alone in his view that stock-market investors may see even worse declines this year on the back of earnings expectations that may be too optimistic.

Michael Kantrowitz at Piper Sandler &amp; Co. said in a CNBC interview last week that he expects the benchmark index to fall to about 3,225 by the end of this yea, or about a 16% slump from current levels.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently restructuring my portfolio and would appreciate any advice. Here is what I am thinking:

&amp;#x200B;

60% Value ETFs and 40% growth ETFs until inflation is at the target level (2%).

Once this has been achieved my plan was to restructure again, allocating more towards growth-based stocks, perhaps 75% growth and 25% value.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe this is suitable a strategy because 1) I am 24 and should take on risks while I can

&amp;#x200B;

2) Value stocks tend to outperform during bear markets and economic recessions, while growth stocks tend to excel during bull markets or periods of economic expansion.

Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac figures show that since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 rose 39 of 47 years when the First Five Days ended up a gain. That is 83% chance of positive for the whole year.

Furthermore, if the Santa Rally, First Five Days, and January Barometer are all positive, then we have a historical 90.3% chance for a positive year. For now, we have 0.8% gain in SPX for Santa Rally and 1.4% gain in First Five Days, the only one left uncertain is January Barometer. 

This week might determine how January would be. We have Powell‚Äôs speech today and a CPI release on Thursday, both will determine market sentiment. 

I don‚Äôt think Powell is going to be more hawkish. CPI growth is slowing down, wage growth m/m is decreasing, the effects of rate hikes are showing up. Currently the CPI YoY is decreasing with a pace of 0.5% or 0.6% per month, and this might come back to 2% level 10 months later, which aligns with the Fed‚Äôs target, so it‚Äôs right time to slow down rate hikes.

1991,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**:  Bad day for the bulls, but another cool day from a technical perspective, as again we saw resistance &amp; support levels play out really well on the daily timeframe.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**: Potential break out of the bear flag remains in effect, as price closed above 387.41 flag's top.  Price must close above 389.25 to validate the move, before closing below that level.  Beautiful move right to 394.30 gap-window before pulling back.  This level will likely provide some resistance again, but 399.40 gap fill (where the 200 DMA sits just below) is the better resistance level now.  Max upside remains 402.40 within the current channel.  Flag's top is unlikely to provide much support, given today's close right on top of this level.  Therefore, 380 ascending TL within the bear flag must hold for the bulls followed by 374.77 flag's bottom (bolstered by 374.13 gap-fill just below) as major support.   
 Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low.

https://preview.redd.it/urdeghipa4ba1.jpg?width=2312&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=826bd602c8b49bbf6a63041176d846a49fd9fb36

**QQQ:** Perhaps a potential breakout of the flag pattern, but I will chalk it up as 10x days into this bear flag pattern due to how close the ascending resistance TL is to flag's top.  Compared to SPY and IWM, price remains more 'stuck' in bearish consolidation, and has yet to post the same clear-potential breakouts...despite posting the bigger gains both days.  Beautiful pierce of both that ascending TL, as well as the 274.78 pivot high from December 21st before pulling back beneath both resistance levels -- not a good sign for the bulls.  If price manages to get anove these levels then 282.33 is gap-window before 286.51 gap-fill offers major resistance.  And of course, the 290 descending channel TL is max upside.  Nearest support is 259.08 flag's bottom &amp; previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.

https://preview.redd.it/h9ba00po94ba1.jpg?width=2313&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6b679e0119dbdc4cdd0398a7f8d4b2a797c4d8cf

**IWM:** The potential break out of the bear flag remains in effect, despite the down day, as price remains above the 176.80 level.  Price must close above 178.04 to validate the move, before closing below 176.80 back under the flag's top.  Perfect tag of 180.19 gap-fill before price fell back down; I would say this is now moderate resistance now.  If price continues higher and can get through this level, then 183.95 descending channel TL is major resistance.  There is a chance 176.80 flag's top could offer support, but if price closes below this level then 173.71 ascending TL within the flag must hold for the bulls; otherwise, 170.67 flag's bottom coupled by 169.11 the pre-COVID high is major support.  And of course, 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows should also generate a sizable bounce.

**Type**: Short to Enter  
**Symbol**: FCX  
**Entry Price**: 43.62  
**Entry Size**: 0.75%  
**Thesis**:  Double top after a 3-day surge in price.  The potential cup-n-handle pattern this formed caused me to only commit a 0.75% position size at first.  I will add to this at 48.00 and again at 52.00 the next double top from April 2022.  My target is at least 38.00, with the potential to hit the 200 DMA depending on if/how this pullbacks.

**Type**:  Short to Enter  
**Symbol**:  GLW  
**Entry Price**: 35.50  
**Entry Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**:  My actual target for this trade was 36.00 in the gap from late August 2022; however, as the broader market began to roll over I pulled the trigger here given the impressive 7-day up move.  But failure to get to my actual target led me to go with only a 0.5% position.  I will add another tranche to bring this to a 1% position at 37.75 -- and then add again on move up to 39.50 - 40.00 descending TL.  My target is at least 33.50 depending on if/how price pulls back, but ideally I would see the 32.50 gap-fill.

This week the consumer price index for December will be published and an estimate that the downtrend of inflation will continue. 

However, annual inflation will remain high, which is a cause for concern for the Fed. It will be important to pay attention to inflation in the services section, where inflation is more persistent. While the it clear that inflation has already reached its peak, it is not falling at a rapid rate as the Fed expected or hoped. If this trend continues, this could lead to higher interest rate hikes than currently priced in.

Sizing:  

The SPX is 10x the size of the SPY. Therefore, one SPX options contract is worth 10 SPY contracts, allowing you to save on commissions. 

Tax Treatment:

For SPX options, 60% of profits are taxed at long-term rates while 40% is taxed at short-term rates.   The SPY equity and options are taxed like any other stock; any option profits held for less than one year are taxed at the short-term capital gains rate.

 An ascending triangle is a chart pattern that occurs when the price of a stock or other asset is consolidating in a tight range and is forming higher lows. This pattern is called an ""ascending"" triangle because it has a flat top and an upward-sloping bottom. 

The pattern is formed when the asset's price is rising and hits a resistance level, which is a level at which the price has difficulty breaking through. The price then bounces off this resistance level and forms a series of higher lows as it continues to test the resistance.

Without naming anything, I am currently invested in a small company that makes a product that I have enjoyed for years. They nearly went bankrupt a decade or so ago, but over the past two years they have been consistently improving their revenue and expanding their product line/market reach. They still are not profitable, but they seem to be getting closer with every quarter, and they have plenty of cash with no significant debt. 

Here comes the strange thing. Several members on the board of directors/upper management recently filed to rescind a fairly large number of shares held as RSUs. The shares were marked as disposed of and were sold at $0. What does this mean? From my understanding, RSUs are a form of payment, so the members can only stand to gain profit by holding onto them and selling once vested, regardless of how the company performs. Why would they choose to dispose of these shares? Is this a tactic to increase the number of shares available to sell and raise money for the company?

We have observed the performance of DXY for nearly a month, and DXY is continuing to form evidence of the secondary market in a long-term bearish manner.

Last week's rebound followed by a sharp pullback effectively tested the pressure range of the f-line

After screening multiple stocks, $FLJ's current state is very suitable to grab the top spot in this big rally!

Studying the changes in the Chinese market and the divestiture of $FLJ's own bad business shows that $FLJ has enough energy to bottom out in terms of market, business model, and capital reserves

Moreover, the current price will immediately break through the long-term bottom, which is the best long-term buying opportunity

From a long-term perspective, there is enough space above, we can hold for a long time and lock in profits at the position of the third pressure level

Due to the large fluctuation of $FLJ and the small market value, the current position can be controlled between 30-50%, and the position can be increased after breaking through the first bottom pressure price of $5

2072,StockMarket,"I see these posts about how great the S&amp;P does, and we all know it does well over the long run.  Historically most all assets do well versus inflation over the long run.  But have you ever looked at asset returns when compared to the money supply?  Spoiler: it's pretty facsinating.

Here is the chart of the S&amp;P 500 divided by the M2 money supply: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/aEoSZiGX/?symbol=SPX%2FM2SL](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/aEoSZiGX/?symbol=SPX%2FM2SL)

Sure it goes up and down like literally any other asset chart, but the fact that it is flat since 1960 after hearing about how the S&amp;P 500 relentlessly marches up is pretty intriguing.  I guess the number of dollars in circulation also relentlessly marches upward...

What are your thoughts on this?  Is all of investing, specifically stocks, just a game of trying to keep up with the rate at which the Fed prints money?  

It sure does seem that way.  If your assets grow in value at the same rate at which the Fed prints new money, I guess you get rich over time even when counting for inflation.

2073,StockMarket,Hi happy new year everyone. This year has started off pretty well for me as I 17M just started taking stock market and option trading very serious. I personally have been able to see the opportunities and possibilities of how much money we can seriously make within this type of market when u are on your keys and correct stuff. It also helps to have 3 friends which have made 50k to 100k in one month trading options helping you along the way and teaching you everything which I‚Äôm truly blessed for. One in which he is a 24M makes 200k a month off of it and just seriously shows me how there is honestly endless possibilities to this. No one our age is doing what we are doing beside these 1 or 2 kids here and there and they make only a few bucks here and there. For us a average or ok day is at least half a grand to a grand of profit. We are trying to focus on growing our portfolio and build large capital. It‚Äôs just amazing to me how is a group of me 17 year old and them 3 18M year old kids can come together and make in loads of money and we all just got back in within the past month due to a lot of things. Just 4 kids from Long Island soon projected to make well over 5 figures and soon down the road 6 Meanwhile that‚Äôs just really my main goal as they already do those things.  The market is truly the land of opportunities and I already do come from a family of great wealth as I live in the GOMD cost of Long Island but I truly believe I could seriously extend my families wealth to a whole new level if I really keep on with this and trade every week for years to come.

Do any other smaller account have insights on how they trade SPY? I‚Äôm looking to expand my options the next time I find an opportunity.

It can be seen that most of the shares also returned sharply after a drop of 20% or more from a peak. The S&amp;P 500 has risen an average of 15% the seven times stocks have fallen 20% or more from a record high.

2121,StockMarket,"**OVERALL:** First big up-move of 2023, but technically only 2x indexes saw potential break outs.  As

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**:  Potential break out of the bear flag; price came into that convergence area of 20/50/100 DMAs before pulling back.  Price must close above 389.25 to validate the move, before closing below 387.41 back under the flag's top.  Nearest resistance is 394.30 gap-window from December 15th, followed by major resistance at 399.40 gap fill (where the 200 DMA has now fallen just below).  Max upside remains 402.50 within the current channel.  Nearest support is now 380 ascending TL within the bear flag, followed by 374.77 flag's bottom (bolstered by 374.13 gap-fill just below).  Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low. 

https://preview.redd.it/5rssex7mvnaa1.jpg?width=2316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=578196104d8ff98de9b75779b0eaf786309debad

**QQQ:**  9x days into this bear flag pattern.  While tech saw the biggest percentage move, the fact is price remains within its bear flag and also under its ascending resistance TL; therefore, no break out (yet).  Nearest resistance is 272 ascending TL (where the 20 DMA has now reached), then there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st. Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is beginning to converge with the channel's descending upper TL. Nearest support is 259.08 flag's bottom &amp; previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.

**IWM:**  Potential break out of the bear flag; price perfectly hit the 178.03 gap-window before pulling back.  Price must close above 178.04 to validate the move, before closing below 176.80 back under the flag's top.  Nearest and major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th, with the 50/100 DMAs just under the level and the 200 DMA just above the level. Max upside remains around 184 the channel's upper TL. Nearest support is 173.25 the ascending TL within the bear flag.  Moderate support is 170.67 the flag's bottom coupled by 169.11 the pre-COVID high.  Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows.

**I executed 4x trades today: 1x close, 1x buy/add, and 2x short/add:**

**Type**: Sell to Close  
**Symbol**: MOS  
**Return**: + 10.4%  
**Entry Date**: 1/04/2023  
**Avg Price**:  42.39  
**Exit Price**:  46.81  
**Position Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**:  I closed this position on 3x days of solid up move and as price went into a resistance zone created by multiple pivot lows from September thru December 2022.  Since the position size was not even a full 1% or more, I closed the entire position; had it been bigger, I would have closed 1/2 to see if the other half could run to those descending TLs above 50.

**Type**: Buy to Add -- Premarket  
**Symbol**: TSLA  
**Add Price**:  103.63  
**Add Size**: 0.5%  
**New Avg**:  117.34  
**New Size**:  3%  
**Thesis**: I added to this position as price hit its next support level, a gap-fill from Fall 2020, which I identified in a previous post.  The next major support level is 91.63 -- I will add up to 2% to the overall position.  My target is around $136 the original breakdown TL, which is now also where the 20 DMA has come down into.

https://preview.redd.it/nktlk2u7rnaa1.jpg?width=2310&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63298bc56c55ba2665e2e2eadb76d6bc0b6a4eca

**Type**: Shorts to Add  
**Symbol**: LVS  //  MRK  
**Add Price**:  52.00  // 115.00  
**Add Size**: 0.75%  // 1%  
**New Avg**:  49.78  //  107.39  
**New Size**:  1.5%  //  2%  
**Thesis**:  These trades are similar in that I believe money is rotating into them as relative ""safety plays"" given the volatility we're see across the markets and economy writ-large.  However, I believe even these ""safety plays"" will see trouble as the economy hits deeper recession, especially when the Fed does not lower rates (as the market has come to expect) in 2023.  When this realization finally hits, the money rotating into these names will rotate out and head for foreign investment (China, Brazil, etc).  The fact price in SPY, QQQ, and IWM are making a move to their upper descending TLs only bolsters my conviction, as hitting those levels to set up the next move down to break the Fall 2022 lows should provide an opportunity to cover these shorts.",Daily Review &amp; Trades: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,1673115123

I am quite unsure whether to carry on investing in the s&amp;p 500, it would be great if someone could give me further directions or reassure me.

As of now I have invested in 6 shares (¬£370.15) in the vanguard s&amp;p 500 and have made a profit of ¬£30.15, I think it used to be ¬£40 but as you know the economy isn't doing so well.

I know this whole scenario is a bit dumb, but I am dumb haha. I just want to know if I should carry on investing because I am planning to put a big chunk into it. Or should I consider another ETF?

Dollar cost average -- buy some every month regardless of what the market is doing. When the market was like 2022 and probably 2023 buy as much as you possibly can on a big down day.

Diversify -- good cheap, broad market ETFs from Vanguard or Fidelity are great.

Let physics or whatever heavenly name you want to call it be your friend -- ""COMPOUND INTEREST"" has no equal, except lack of time. A young person can get rich in 30-35 years if they follow these rules.

And, If you are younger, hope the market stays down for years. It is your time to accumulate and get that snowball rolling, so that when you are in your 50s you are making more in the market than from your salary. I started seeing that in my late 40s, but I have maxed out everything for going on 26 years. Learn about FI. And best of luck.",Hang in There!

2183,StockMarket," I started trading in 2017, and after years of learning and trial and error I started to find success that came at a rapid pace. I started to see small consistent wins starting in late 2019 and like most, it continued through 2020 and 2021 growing the p/l month by month. I have always considered myself an extremely disciplined person and that helped me in anything I had ever decided to pursue whether that was something athletic or trading. 

When I first found success trading I found it through a systemic approach that allowed me to keep emotions out of my decisions and simply execute based on proven backtests and market data (see prior post). Throughout 2019-2021 I was extremely good at staying disciplined just executing my system and accepting the outcomes. 

About halfway through 2022 after an extremely successful first half of the year (surpassing all prior years' P/L combined with extremely large daily weekly and monthly p/l‚Äôs) I still thought that my system could be doing better and ended up uprooting the entire thing to chase bigger profits and something to bring back the excitement to trading.

This one decision cost me the entire year in 3 months and a complete mental breakdown of what I had been doing prior which worked. All because I got greedy and wanted more and had failed to accept what the market was providing me so I went looking for more and forcing trades. 

For example:

2021 provided 1,000+ R in P/L

Halfway through 2022, I was up just over 200R

That is why I wanted more and started chasing other trades but the market wasn‚Äôt providing that level of profitability at the time. Looking back I was lucky to be doing so well in the first place with how tough of a year it was in all financial markets. Some years you crush it, some years are slower, take what you‚Äôre given and execute it to the best of your abilities. 

We‚Äôve all heard the term ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have to trade every day‚Äù and it didn‚Äôt really hit home until having this experience. There is a fine line between making yourself better and adjusting your trading based on what the market is doing and adapting to it so you can succeed vs. fully disbanding what you have successfully been doing that is proven to work to chase more clout and money for your own ego. You have to walk that line very carefully. 

This was extremely humbling for me and brought me back to reality with a lifelong lesson. It just could have been a little cheaper LOL

Summary
Lumen likely alienated income investors as it eliminated its dividend, forcing dividend investors to exit rapidly.
Therefore, LUMN's capitulation to form its December lows has likely reflected this massive bailout.
The company is repositioning for growth amid worsening macro headwinds. Hence, the strategic capital allocation adjustment seems appropriate.
Investors with a high conviction of its growth pivot and tolerance for downside volatility could find these levels attractive.
I do much more than just articles at Ultimate Growth Investing: Members get access to model portfolios, regular updates, a chat room, and more. 

Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) has consolidated constructively after a disastrous FQ3 earnings release, where it ""eliminated its dividend"" and moved its capital allocation priorities into share buybacks.

The company's strategic change was necessary as it's repositioning for growth execution moving ahead. As such, the company needs to manage its resources appropriately, given intensifying macroeconomic headwinds that could crimp its ability to invest if it retained its dividend strategy.

With its $1.5B share buyback program, the company has the flexibility of deploying it within a two-year window. While we assessed that it's a credible move given the current interest rate regime to conserve cash flow, dividend investors who relied on LUMN for income investing likely bailed out in droves.

As such, we believe that the capitulation by income investors has likely been contemplated at LUMN's November/December lows.

Hence, the critical question facing investors now is whether management is competent enough to execute its growth priorities, even as recessionary headwinds are starting to hit enterprise/business customers.

As an integrated Telco company, Lumen has higher exposure to its business customers, as they accounted for more than 73% of its FQ3 revenue. Hence, we believe management is focused on improving its execution in this segment, as CEO Kate Johnson articulated:

And then now, for the first time ever, [we have] a leader running the team to serve SMB and mid-market. The mid-market motion is completely different than the enterprise motion. And so it got starved a little bit in the process. Now we see a huge opportunity there to invest and go after that segment with the right leadership, and it's going to 100% depend on our ability to build and nurture a partner ecosystem to help us cover those customers. (Citi's 2023 Communications, Media &amp; Entertainment Conference)

Hence, the critical question facing investors is whether they believe that Lumen is well-positioned to go after growth, even as its revenue growth has declined.

Wall Street analysts have likely penciled in their bear case estimates, expecting the company's adjusted EBITDA profitability to continue coming under considerable pressure.

Accordingly, Lumen is projected to post an adjusted EBITDA growth of -19% in FY22 to $6.85B. Hence, it's markedly below the company's midpoint guidance of $7B, maintained in its most recently reported quarter.

As such, we believe Lumen has been proffered a ""lower bar"" to cross in its upcoming Q4 card. Notwithstanding, Lumen still needs to prove its ability to generate growth given a forthcoming recession.

However, with the Street expecting a further 22% YoY fall in its adjusted EBITDA for FY23, management has the opportunity to defy the Street's outlook and lift buying sentiments.

LUMN last traded at an NTM EBITDA of 5.7x (10Y average: 5.6x), which surged from its lows of 2021 as its forward estimates were slashed. However, it still trades at a discount against its peers' median of 6.65x (according to S&amp;P Cap IQ data). Hence, LUMN is no longer expensive.

But is the valuation discount justified? We believe the company's move to prioritize growth in favor of its dividend strategy has likely introduced higher execution risks for investors to assess.

It's a factor that Johnson also highlighted:

So the first thing is [developing] customer obsession. I've talked a lot about that. That's building a muscle that will serve us well for growth. But investing for growth, these are parts of the company that have been starving for a long time. Sales and marketing, when you're operational efficiency focused, you tend not to spend nearly enough on sales and marketing. The next thing is building a reliable execution engine. And that's everything from product invention to launch all the way through the life cycle to selling and supporting customers. So you'll see us really fine-tuning our execution engine there. (Citi's conference)

Therefore, we believe Lumen's near- and medium-term challenges are far from over as the company works on its transformation and growth priorities. However, we assessed that the capitulation toward its December lows has likely baked in these headwinds, coupled with the likely departure of income investors. As such, it should augur well for LUMN's recovery from its well-oversold levels.

2218,StockMarket,"Canada Nickel (TSXV: CNC) (OTCQX: CNIKF) announced that its latest test results support the incorporation of carbon capture and storage into the Crawford Nickel Project. The company‚Äôs In-Process Tailings (IPT) Carbonation process is a novel method for generating a significant decrease in mining emmissions and has transformative potential for the entire mining sector. The latest test work reveals that existing process streams can be used for IPT Carbonation which Canada Nickel believes should allow it to be timely and cost effectively engineered and incorporated into the mining process.

With a major catalyst, the integrated feasibility study for the Crawford project, expected in the second quarter of 2023, Canada Nickel is well positioned to be ready for construction to begin once all necessary permits are received by mid-2025.

Canada Nickel believes that incorporating IPT Carbonation could potentially allow a part of their project capital expenditures to become eligible for the carbon capture and storage refundable investment tax credits of 37.5% to 60% from 2022-30 and 18.75% to 30% form 2031-40 announced in Canada‚Äôs 2022 federal budget documents. The company believes it can demonstrate that mineral sequestration is an effective carbon storage approach that would meet Environmental and Climate Change Canada requirements.

Canada Nickel has successfully tested the regional exploration potential at Reid, Deloro, Sothman and Reaume, which are hosted in the same mineralization as Crawford ‚Äì offering the same potential for integrated carbon capture and storage.

The company believes that these conditions set the stage for a Zero Carbon Industrial Cluster in the Timmins-Cochrane region.

IPT Carbonation ‚Äì Crawford Nickel Project

Canada Nickel‚Äôs Crawford Project is hosted in ultramafic rock, which naturally absorbs and sequesters CO2.

The potential to actively capture and sequester carbon was a key consideration in Canada Nickel‚Äôs acquisition of the 42 km2 of target ultramafic rocks in the Timmins area which could anchor a zero-carbon industrial cluster in Timmins.

Canada Nickel has developed a simple active process that utilizes tailings as generated in the milling process and injects a concentrated source of CO2 for a brief period of time.

This novel process for accelerated mineral carbonation is called In Process Tailings Carbonation or IPT Carbonation, which fixes CO2 geologically while the tailings are still in the processing circuit, rather than after they have been finally deposited.

The Company believes that, given its relative simplicity, this process could be scaled up with availability of concentrated (rather than atmospheric) sources of CO2. This CO2 could potentially be delivered by downstream processing of Crawford concentrates, a wide range of industrial processing activities, green hydrogen production, or carbon capture facilities.

The process demonstrates the potential to produce NetZero NickelTM and NetZero CobaltTM for the EV industry, NetZero IronTM and chromium for the stainless-steel industry and generate substantial carbon credits during the process.

https://preview.redd.it/ivxvx4zetfaa1.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0258ca9a979b5a818dbe1534966fd0a9dc491462

The Company believes that the need for a concentrated source of CO2 for this process and the substantial CO2 capture and storage capacity potential of its ultramafic land position could form the basis for an entire Zero Carbon Industrial Cluster in the Timmins-Cochrane region.

The latest results from further lab scale testing at Kingston Process Metallurgy (‚ÄúKPM‚Äù) confirmed that a blend of tailings expected to be produced by Crawford and thickened to an expected operating tailings density could be successfully carbonated with the IPT Carbonation process ‚Äì it is a significant result to demonstrate the process at higher solids densities as the pulp density and the tailings residence time will be a key driver of the process capital and operating costs.

The testing also attempted to understand what ultimate carbon capture potential is possible and the test resulted in 37 tonnes of CO2 captured per tonne of nickel ‚Äì 34 tonnes of that amount was captured within 25 hours. The 37 tonne figure is believed to represent a potential maximum and there is no certainty that such amount could be achieved in commercial operation.

The retailer, citing worse-than-expected sales, issued a ‚Äúgoing concern‚Äù warning that in the upcoming months it likely will not have the cash to cover expenses, such as lease agreements or payments to suppliers. Bed Bath said it is exploring financial options, such as restructuring, seeking additional capital or selling assets, in addition to a potential bankruptcy.

Shares of the company fell about 30% to close the day at $1.69 after Bed Bath issued the updates in a pair of financial filings. The stock earlier touched a 52-week low earlier in the day. Its market value has fallen to about $149 million as of Thursday‚Äôs close.

Still, CEO Sue Gove said the retailer is focused on rebuilding the business and making sure its brands, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Buybuy Baby and Harmon, ‚Äúremain destinations of choice for customers well into the future.‚Äù

Among its challenges, Bed Bath said it is having trouble getting enough merchandise to fill its shelves and is drawing fewer customers to its stores and website.

The retailer also said it wasn‚Äôt able to refinance a portion of its debt, less than a month after notifying investors it planned to borrow more in order to pay off chunks of existing obligations.

Bed Bath‚Äôs debt load has been weighing on the company. The retailer has nearly $1.2 billion in unsecured notes, which have maturity dates spread across 2024, 2034 and 2044. In recent quarters, Bed Bath has warned it‚Äôs been quickly burning through cash.

&gt; ‚ÄúAnd if we have a recession, the market will have ended its decline, say, down 35% from its peak, so that gives you the low 3,000s,‚Äù Cooperman added.

&gt; Stocks are headed for losses in the first trading week of 2023. As of Thursday‚Äôs close, the Dow is down 0.66% week to date, headed for its fourth down week in five. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are both on pace for their fifth straight week of losses, down 0.82% and 1.54%, respectively.

2235,StockMarket,"So can anyone explain to me why high-end luxury brands like:
- Hermes (up 60% in last 6 months) 
- LVMH (up 30% in last 6 months) 
- Dior (up 40% in last 6 months)
have rallied back to all time highs in an inflationary environment with rising interest rates, job cuts and an impending recession that no one seems to shut up about? 

These are European brands and regarded as being ""bougie"", ""chique"" &amp; luxury over here (As a european I'm not sure as to how well known these brands are and how they are perceived by the US &amp; worldwide consumer) 

Wouldn't these highly priced non-essential fashion goods be the first things to be cut by consumer spending in a recession? Also while Europe is currently being plagued by high energy prices &amp; a cold winter. And all major companies seem te be cutting costs and laying off thousands of workers. 

It's well known that consumer staples companies tend to stay relatively stable in economic downturns but why are these cyclical consumer discretionary companies outperforming the market so well? 

We all know that stock prices are forward looking and thus far these stocks appear to be pricing in some prety stellar earnings results. So am I wrong to assume that luxury brands will be the first to take a hit in an economic recession? Anyway I'm looking forward to the next earnings season in a couple of weeks and to hear their performance outlooks. 

I'm looking forward to reading your thoughts and how well known these companies &amp; their subsidiaries are outside of europe.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**: 13x days into this bear flag; trading occured on slight below average volume. Nearest support is 374.77 flag's bottom, with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low.  Nearest resistance is 387.41 flag's top flag which is still bolstered by the convergence of 3x MAs: 20, 50, and 100. Additionally, the major resistance at 389.63 gap fill remains just above this level. A secondary major resistance level is at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill; of note, gap fill is now also where the 200 DMA has fallen down into. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel.

**QQQ:**  8x days into this bear flag pattern; trading occured on slight below average volume. Nearest support is 259.08 the flag's bottom &amp; previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th. Nearest resistance is 271.50 ascending TL (also where the 20 DMA is fast approaching), then there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st. Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.

**IWM:** 13x days into this bear flag; trading occurred on below average volume.  Nearest support is 170.67 the flag's bottom is still the nearest support level, followed by 169.11 the pre-COVID high. Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows. Nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's top. Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th, which is now also where the 50 and 100 DMAs have crossed/converged. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL.

&amp;#x200B;

I executed 2x trades today: 1x trade to open a position and 1x trade to close a position.

**Type**: Sell to Close (Final)  
**Symbol**: MARA  
**Return**: + 7.37% (8.7% across both tranches)  
**Entry Date**: 12/08/2022  
**Avg Price**: 3.75  
**Exit Price**: 4.03  
**Position Size**: 0.75%  
**Thesis**: As discussed in yesterday's post, I closed the position as price pulled back below the 20 DMA and gap-window during the pre-market.

 

**Type**: Buy to Open  
**Symbol**: UNG  
**Entry Price**: 12.00  
**Position Size**: 1%  
**Thesis**: I entered this position today as price piereced a double-bottom hitting major support dating back to late 2021. I took a full 1% position becuase of how extended price is to the downside (14 or 16 days, depending on which pivot high is used).  In hindsight, I should have set a 0.5% position to trigger at 12.00 (in the event the whole-round number provided support) and then another 0.5% at 11.69 (the lowest pivot from late 2021).  Today's price action reached a low of 11.62 -- so a perfect pierce of that double bottom.  My next tranche will be at 11.26 the gap fill from June 2021. There are multiple exit points I am considering on this trade; which I execute will depend on how price moves up into them.

2271,StockMarket,"The wealthy haven't bought stocks in over 50 years. All they do is sell...you know that, right?

In the old days, back in the 60's, 70's and part of the 80's, there was a thing called ""buy low, sell high"". The trading strategy was valid back then because shorts actually covered their short positions when they were wrong. They had to pay higher and many ended up going broke.

That all changed!

Now short sellers have no risk. They get bailed out by the US Government. They get insiders to be in bed with them to screw over shareholders. If stocks go up in value, the shorts never cover. They just wait...and the big banks forgive them their interest payments. On the contrary, they give them more money to short. Naked shorting...you've heard of that? This is happening as we speak. These people play with money they don't have.

Insiders have only one goal: to sell shares. They announce good...bad...whatever. They sell only. And when they run out of shares to sell, they print more! And when the price gets too low and the exchange threatens to delist them, they authorize new shares and reverse split. You think your vote counts? Never.

It doesn't matter if the stock is $100/share or $10/share or $1/share. When insiders sell something that they paid nothing to buy, it's 100% profits for them. For you, it's a loss because you actually paid a price to buy shares.

Tel Aviv, Israel / Vancouver, Canada, Jan. 05, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clearmind Medicine Inc. (Nasdaq, CSE: CMND), (FSE: CWY) (‚Äú**Clearmind**‚Äù or the ""**Company**""), a biotech company focused on discovery and development of novel psychedelic-derived therapeutics to solve major undertreated health problems, today announced positive pre-clinical results demonstrating efficacy of its drug candidate MEAI for treating obesity and metabolic syndrome.

The study, conducted at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, as part of a collaboration established with the university‚Äôs technology transfer company, Yissum, included multi-parameter metabolic assessments such as body weight, fat mass, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, liver enzymes and fat accumulation as well as food consumption patterns. It included three groups of rodents: one was fed a standard diet, another a high-fat diet, and the third a high-fat diet group along with treatment with MEAI.

* The withdrawals came as crypto exchange FTX, a Silvergate customer, collapsed in scandal, raising questions about the stability of the digital asset industry.
* At the end of December, $150 million of the bank‚Äôs deposits were held by customers who had filed bankruptcy, Silvergate said.

Shares of Silvergate Capital sank nearly 40% on Thursday after the crypto-focused bank released preliminary fourth-quarter results that showed massive customer withdrawals.

Total deposits from digital asset customers declined to $3.8 billion from $11.9 billion at the end of the third quarter, a decline of roughly 68%. The withdrawals came as crypto exchange FTX, a Silvergate customer, collapsed in scandal, raising questions about the stability of the digital asset industry. Silvergate said there was a ‚Äúcrisis of confidence across the ecosystem.‚Äù

 At the end of December, $150 million of the bank‚Äôs deposits were held by customers who had filed for bankruptcy protection, Silvergate said.

In order to raise cash during this period, Silvergate sold $5.2 billion of debt securities, creating a loss on sale of $718 million. It reported $4.6 billion in total cash and cash equivalents held at the end of December.

‚ÄúIn response to the rapid changes in the digital asset industry during the fourth quarter, we took commensurate steps to ensure that we were maintaining cash liquidity in order to satisfy potential deposit outflows, and we currently maintain a cash position in excess of our digital asset related deposits,‚Äù CEO Alan Lane said in a statement.

Silvergate also announced that it is laying off 200 employers, or about 40% of its workforce, and exited its mortgage warehouse lending business.

Thursday‚Äôs stock move erased a big rally for Silvergate on Wednesday, when shares gained 27%.

Silvergate, which went public in 2019, saw its stock rise as high as $222 per share in November 2021, the same month as the peak price in Bitcoin. Silvergate share ended 2022 at $17.40, more than 90% off its all-time high.

What is IV? 

Implied volatility, or IV, is a measure of how much the price of a stock or other underlying asset is expected to fluctuate in the future. In options trading, IV is important because it affects the price of options contracts.  The price of an options contract is made up of two parts: the intrinsic value and the extrinsic value.¬†   


IV crush, also known as an ""implied volatility crush,"" is a phenomenon that occurs in the options market when the implied volatility of an options contract suddenly decreases. This can happen for various reasons, such as changing market conditions or expiring options contracts.

Today is going to be a momentum-based day for the markets. Take advantage of the opportunities to trade, but be smart and passive with your allocations to ensure you are practicing risk management. Trade only when given a confirmation of a reversal, and do not attempt to catch any falling knives today. 

Watch out and be careful when attempting to trade high-beta stocks at the moment that you believe are undervalued due to the relatively high price that it was at one point. I would recommend you look into allocating to low-risk, high-reward futuristic plays that provide security and assurance that the organization will do well. This is not a recommendation to get into tech nor pharma but more of a recommendation to get into consumer staples and other organizations that are related to them.

2356,StockMarket,"**OVERALL:** Further bearish consolidation across all 3x majors, as price action occured entirely within yesterday's move and also occured on average volume. Daily MAs are now at-or-below technical resistance levels, which will only make the bulls have to work that much harder to overcome. While price may still rise on the days-week timeframe (e.g. micro trend), such a move would very much be part of natural, bearish consolidation on the weeks-month timeframe (e.g. macro trend).

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**: 12x days into this bear flag &amp; trading occurred entirly within yesterday's move and on average volume. If price continues higher, then the nearest resistance is 387.41 top of the flag which is now also being bolstered by the crossage of 3x MAs: 20, 50, and 100. Additionally, the major resistance at 389.63 gap fill remains just above this level. A secondary major resistance level is at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill; of note, gap fill is now also where the 200 DMA has fallen down into. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel. If price pivots lower, nearest support remains the bottom of the flag at 374.77 -- with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low. 

https://preview.redd.it/mg0jmtito4aa1.jpg?width=2315&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2db7b6af963466e556623e425ecea4b8e140c55

**QQQ:** Price remained entirely within yesterday's move here as well, and may still be the 7th day of a bear flag pattern. If price continues higher, then the nearest resistance is 271.50 the ascending TL which got tagged yesterday.  If price can get through that level, there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st (also where the 20 DMA crossed below today). Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.  If price pivots lower, nearest support remains 259.08 the previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.

https://preview.redd.it/3xpgh127o4aa1.jpg?width=2311&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2fd69f256e24fbc43a45bc257cd0167a4b2cb3c

**IWM:** 12x days into this bear flag; trading occurred on average volume &amp; entirely within yesterday's movement, again.  Both the 20 DMA and ceiling of the bear flag were tested again today, and held again.  This obviously weakens the level from a resistance standpoint, but it remains the nearest resistance point at 176.80 if price continues higher.  Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th, which is now also where the 50 and 100 DMAs have crossed/converged. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL.  If price heads lower, 170.67 the flag's bottom is still the nearest support level, followed by 169.11 the pre-COVID high. Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows.

**Position Size**:  0.75%  
**Remaining Size**:  0.75%  
**Thesis**:  I entered this trade over a few tranches as price fell into several major support levels dating back to late 2020. Today's move brought price to 4.13 gap-window and the 20 DMA, at which point I exited half the position.  Ultimately, the move today filled the ap at 4.34 before pulling back slightly towards the end of the day.  I will look to exit the 2nd half tomorrow depending on how price reacts through the overnight.

**Cover Price**:  87.45  
**Position Size**:  0.5%  
**Thesis**: I entered this trade as price hit its 16th day of forming a bear flag and as it reached the highest point of the consolidation zone which formed the flag.  I entered with only a 0.5% position thinking I would add another 0.5% to 1% if price returned to $98 -- but it never this that secondary/add level.  I chose to exit this position as price hit 87.45 the 200 DMA.  Had the position size been larger, I would've exited half the position to let the other half run, but given it was just the entry-size, I closed the trade entirely.

**Entry Date**:  12/30/2022  
**Entry Price**:  85.92  
**Exit Price**:  91.65  
**Position Size**:  0.5%  
**Thesis**:  I entered this trade after missing the entry I actually wanted, which occurred two days prior as price fell into 2x major support levels.  However, price lingered close enough around those support levels, which allowed me to get in without ""chasing"" too-too terrible.  I only entered a 0.5% position in the event price continued lower after the New Year, but it did not.  Therefore, I chose not to exit the position yesterday when it hit the 20 DMA because of my small position size -- and likewise, I do not want to wait until price reaches that descending TL at the risk of price reversing beforehand.  In short, the small position size did not give me a much flexibility as I would've liked in this trade, but I would rather have less manueverability getting out of positions if it means preserving capital to maneuver into positions.

**Type**:  Buy to Open  
**Symbol**:  MOS  
**Entry Price**:  42.39  
**Position Size**:  0.5%  
**Thesis**:  I entered this position today as price piereced a double-bottom hitting major support.  The reason I only took a 0.5% position is becuase the choppy grind down to the level, in addition to the consolidation from December 15 - 27, would make it not surprising if we saw more downside in the near term.  My next add level is 39.95 gap-fill from mid-January 2022, which coincides with a bullish consolidation zone whcih occured in late-December 2021.

I'm a 35 year old father of a 1 year old son. Inm a cop, so i work in shifts (mornings, evenings and nights). I'm currently investing about ‚Ç¨750 a month in IWDA on DeGiro and around ‚Ç¨350 a month on crypto (BTC and ETH).

In a recent post i made (resum√© of my finances in 2022), somebody replied that i would be better of stopping my investments in crypto and using that money to study to become a better investor. That seems like a great idea, but i'm not sure where you start. 

I'm not a complete noob, as i've been watching a couple of investing YouTube channels in 2022 and i've read a couple of books concerning fire and money management. I've also veen following some Reddit communities concerning investing, so i have a (small) basic understanding about finance, investing and risk management.

Do you guys have any recomendations on courses or studies i could follow? Taking into account that i work around 26 days a month (i know, it's a lot but it gets me paid) and i cannot go go class on a regular basis. So studying at home is a must.

2381,StockMarket,"Federal Reserve officials are committed to fighting inflation and expect higher interest rates to remain in place until more progress is made, according to minutes released Wednesday from the central bank‚Äôs December meeting.

At a meeting where policymakers raised their key interest rate another half a percentage point, they expressed the importance of keeping restrictive policy in place while inflation holds unacceptably high.

‚ÄúParticipants generally observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to 2 percent, which was likely to take some time,‚Äù the meeting summary stated. ‚ÄúIn view of the persistent and unacceptably high level of inflation, several participants commented that historical experience cautioned against prematurely loosening monetary policy.‚Äù

The increase ended a streak of four consecutive three-quarter point rate hikes, while taking the target range for the benchmark fed funds rate to 4.25%-4.5%, its highest level in 15 years.

Officials also said they would focus on data as they move forward and see ‚Äúthe need to retain flexibility and optionality‚Äù regarding policy.

Officials further cautioned that the public shouldn‚Äôt read too much into the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee‚Äôs move to step down the pace of increases.

‚ÄúA number of participants emphasized that it would be important to clearly communicate that a slowing in the pace of rate increases was not an indication of any weakening of the Committee‚Äôs resolve to achieve its price-stability goal or a judgment that inflation was already on a persistent downward path,‚Äù the minutes said.

Following the meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that while there has been some progress made in the battle against inflation, he saw only halting signs and expects rates to hold at higher levels even after the increases cease.

The minutes reflected those sentiments, noting that no FOMC members expect rate cuts in 2023, despite market pricing.

Markets currently are pricing in the likelihood of rate increases totaling 0.5-0.75 percentage point before pausing to evaluate the impact the increases are having on the economy. Traders expect the central bank to approve a quarter-point increase at the next meeting, which concludes Feb. 1, according to CME Group data.

Current pricing also indicates the possibility of a small reduction in rates by the end of the year, with the funds rate landing around a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Fed officials, however, have expressed doubt repeatedly about any loosening of policy in 2023.

The minutes noted that officials are wrestling with two-pronged policy risks: One, that the Fed doesn‚Äôt keep rates high long enough and allows inflation to fester, similar to the experience in the 1970s; and two, that the Fed keeps restrictive policy in place too long and slows the economy too much, ‚Äúpotentially placing the largest burdens on the most vulnerable groups of the population.‚Äù

However, members said they see the risks more weighted to easing too soon and allowing inflation to run rampant.

‚ÄúParticipants generally indicated that upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the outlook for policy,‚Äù the minutes said. ‚ÄúParticipants generally observed that maintaining a restrictive policy stance for a sustained period until inflation is clearly on a path toward 2 percent is appropriate from a risk-management perspective.‚Äù

Along with the rate hikes, the Fed has been reducing the size of its balance sheet by allowing up to $95 billion in proceeds from maturing securities to roll off each month rather than be reinvested. In a program started in early June, the Fed has seen its balance sheet contract by $364 billion to $8.6 trillion.

While some of the recent inflation metrics have shown progress, the labor market, a critical target of the rate increases, has been resilient. Nonfarm payroll growth has exceeded expectations for most of the past year, and data earlier Wednesday showed that there the number of job openings is still nearly twice the pool of available workers.

The Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index less food and energy, was at 4.7% annually in November, down from its 5.4% peak in February 2022 but still well above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target.

Economists, meanwhile, largely expect the U.S. to enter a recession in the coming months, the result of the Fed‚Äôs tightening and an economy dealing with inflation still running near 40-year highs. However, fourth-quarter GDP for 2022 is tracking at a solid 3.9% rate, easily the best of a year that started out with consecutive negative readings, according to the Atlanta Fed.

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Wednesday, in a post for the district‚Äôs web site, that he sees the funds rate rising to 5.4% and possibly higher if inflation doesn‚Äôt trend down.

**Halberd Corporation** [(OTC PINK:HALB)](https://pr.report/PvQSc98H) The second half of 2022 was a very busy time.

**2022 2nd** **HALF ACHIEVEMENTS**

* Halberd's previous research on development of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) was found to enhance the effectiveness of the leading commercial COVID antibody by 44.4%.
* Halberd formed a Cancer Therapeutics Subsidiary, *Halberd Cancer Therapeutics, LTD*, to allow cancer treatment research to continue in parallel and synergistically with Halberd's work on the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Halberd's base extracorporeal technology is flexible enough to treat numerous diseases through tailoring of designed antibodies. The subsidiary's mission is to develop treatments for various types of cancer utilizing the combined patented and patent-pending technology of both Halberd Corporation, and Halberd Cancer Therapeutics, LTD.
* Carl Eller, the President of the NFL Retired Player's Association issued an open letter endorsing Halberd's efforts in its research into effective treatments for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), which affects many former and current professional athletes, particularly professional football players.
* Halberd was able to demonstrate precise control of a key Cancer related T-Cell protein, PD-1 (programmed cell death-1). PD-1 can be used by tumor cells to fool the body's immune system into allowing the tumor to grow. Precise control of PD-1 levels can allow the body's immune system to attack and eliminate the tumor.
* Halberd entered a strategic alliance with *AI Longevity, Inc*. and *Stem of Hope* as a wholly owned subsidiary of Halberd Corporation named ""ExtendalifeTM."" The mission of this subsidiary is to develop treatments intended to increase longevity and develop successful Alzheimer's Disease and Cancer treatments using the combined patented and patent-pending technologies of the alliance member companies.
* Halberd's researchers successfully demonstrated the removal of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) from human blood serum during in-vitro laboratory studies. Excess IL-6 is associated with inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, MS, some cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Halberd had earlier demonstrated its ability to precisely control the levels of target antigens present in bodily fluid.
* Halberd created a single designed monoclonal antibody which has demonstrated the ability to eradicate multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria from buffer solution in the laboratory. The antibody, with a strong affinity to E. coli and similar bacteria, was conjoined to a metallic nanoparticle and exposed to laser emissive energy. The exposed bacteria were eliminated in a matter of minutes.
* Halberd's in-vitro laboratory tests successfully demonstrated eradication of five identified cancer disease antigens -- CTLA-4, PD-1, PDL-1, IL-6, and TNF-Alpha -- through the use of laser emissive energy, similar to how antibiotic-resistant bacteria were eliminated.
* Halberd reached an agreement with the Hamden Group, a newly formed corporation which consists of members of the Peter Croden family and Darren Hamans. Peter Croden was the former president of Upjohn Corp, Canada, and Upjohn, Europe. Hamden will have worldwide exclusive rights to sell, market and distribute the Halberd patented low dose Naltrexone medication, and the Halberd proprietary Vita-Shield-MaxTM nutraceutical product.
* Halberd's COVID research led to the publication of a peer reviewed scientific article titled, ""*A Novel Plant-Made Monoclonal Antibody Enhances the Synergetic Potency of an Antibody Cocktail Against The SARS-Cov-2 Omicron Variant.""* The article is available [on-line](https://pr.report/4ETKjrAI).
* Halberd's CEO, William A. Hartman, and CTO, Dr. Mitchell S. Felder, in an October ""The Street Reports"" podcast, discussed Halberd's groundbreaking accomplishments utilizing its extracorporeal technology in treating major diseases which heretofore had been regarded as incurable. In December, Hartman and Felder again participated in a ""The Street Reports"" podcast to discuss Halberd's success in eradicating major Cancer disease antigens.
* Halberd researchers recently requested and received from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) an array of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) for testing Halberd's laser eradication technology which had successfully eradicated numerous Gram-Negative bacteria in prior experimentation.
* Halberd prepared a Form 15 for filing with the SEC to restore Halberd as a compliant, up-to-date, fully reporting company. This action should lead to the near term removal of the YIELD sign from the HALB stock symbol on the OTC Markets site.
* We have engaged with a Congressional Representative from Pennsylvania seeking his support in exposing Halberd's technology for the treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and suicide ideation to various government agencies, such as DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). DARPA has already reviewed preliminary material and has shown interest in receiving additional information. Follow-up will proceed in Q1-2023.

**THE LOOK AHEAD**

* Halberd is finalizing the arrangements with Mississippi State University to develop and conduct an animal testing protocol for Halberd's patent-pending nasal spray to safely counteract the effects of Traumatic Brain Injury.
* Halberd has the option to consider loans to complete the required audits and the QB up-list. However, Halberd's Articles of Incorporation preclude the issuance of any convertible promissory notes, convertible preferred stock or other convertible instruments. Halberd has chosen to remain as ""OTC Markets Pink Sheets"" for the near-term.
* Halberd is about to embark on a huge previously unannounced expansion of its capability to eradicate multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria with a single proprietary antibody. While that will require a major focus by Halberd, it offers the largest potential short-term payback to the company and its stockholders.
* Halberd's goal has always been to either secure a significant government contract or partner with Big Pharma, because it did not have the huge quantity of funds necessary to secure FDA approval for its products or processes.
* Government contracts and Big Pharma are not concerned with a company's stock exchange listing; they are focused on the content of the technology being evaluated. With each accomplishment, Halberd moves closer to finalizing a potential government contract and suitable terms for an agreement with Big Pharma.
* Leadership is about making tough decisions using the facts to obtain optimum results. Halberd believes that its interests are best served for the short-term by investing its available resources to advance our technology through R&amp;D and put Halberd in a better position to secure a potential government contract and/or a relationship with Big Pharma.

**SUMMARY**

Halberd management has guided the company thus far to achieve technological advancements beyond those of Big Pharma. Halberd's success was demonstrated by way of publication of the peer-reviewed journal article and recent press release concerning Halberd's successful development of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against Covid and Halberd's single antibody which has been shown effective against multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We believe that our decision to focus on R&amp;D is right for both the short- and long-term interests of the company and its stockholders.

We believe in our mission to create and develop safe and effective treatments against many previously perceived incurable diseases and continue to make progress towards achieving that goal.

We appreciate the efforts of our expanding team of research scientists, and the support of our stockholders. We will continue to maintain transparency and regular communication with our family of interested parties.

Sincerely,

William A. Hartman

I don‚Äôt quite fully understand the difference between the way it works on the fund‚Äôs side when someone invests via a mutual fund vs an ETF.

This brings the question, when people invest in an ETF rather than a mutual fund (let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs an ETF with the same shares and allocation, only difference being fund vs ETF) does this affect the volume data for each individual share differently?  I mean if someone buys an ETF which results in buying 100 $GOOG shares, or a fund which results in 100 $GOOG shares - does the fact that it was purchased via ETF change the way we see volume data?

If there is a difference somehow, I‚Äôm wondering with ETF popularity growth, how might this change the way we view volume data in terms of spotting accumulation / distribution.

Heikin-Ashi candles are a type of technical analysis tool used in trading. They are similar to regular candlestick charts but differ in how they are constructed.¬†

Heikin-Ashi candles are created by taking the average of certain price data from the prior period, such as the open, close, high, and low prices. This average is then used to plot the candles on the chart.

The purpose of using Heikin-Ashi candles is to provide a smoother and more accurate representation of the price action compared to regular candlestick charts. In addition, they are beneficial for identifying trends and potential entry and exit points in the market.

Interpreting the candles

To interpret the trend, you can look at the color of the candle's body. If the body is green, the average price has increased over the period, and the trend is bullish. If the body is red, the average price has decreased over the period, and the trend is bearish.

In addition to the color of the body, you can also look at the candle's wick. If the wick is long, it indicates a significant price movement during the period, and the trend may be losing momentum.

SmallCapVoice.com Inc. (‚ÄúSCV‚Äù) announces the availability of a new interview with Dr. Adi Zuloff-Shani, CEO of Clearmind Medicine Inc. (NASDAQ: CMND) (CSE: CMND) (FWB: CWY), to discuss the biotech company‚Äôs use of non-hallucinogenic psychedelic compounds to treat physical and mental health, including addiction.

Clearmind‚Äôs intellectual portfolio consists of seven patent families. Its lead candidate, CMND-100, is derived from 5-methoxy-2-aminoindane (MEAI), a psychoactive molecule that exerts a euphoric alcohol-like experience and a reduced desire to consume alcohol. CMND-100 is headed for clinical trials in early 2023 as a potential treatment for alcohol-use disorder (AUD), and Clearmind is also exploring the use of its MEAI-based compound to treat cocaine addiction and depression.

Earlier this month, Clearmind was granted a patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for the use of its proprietary MEAI as an alcoholic beverage substitute. Speaking with SCV‚Äôs Stuart Smith, Dr. Zuloff-Shani explains the global need for such treatment.

‚ÄúThe number of alcoholics is striking,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about millions around the world. Alcohol consumption contributes to 3 million deaths each year globally. It is the third leading, preventable cause of death in the U.S. and the yearly cost is enormous ‚Äì around $200-$250 billion and that‚Äôs in 2010.‚Äù

Despite the statistics, Dr. Zuloff-Shani says that existing treatment options in this largely underserved market are largely ineffective. ‚ÄúYou would think that a huge problem probably has a lot of treatments to offer,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs just the opposite. Since 1950, only three treatments were approved by the FDA. I cannot say that any of them are very effective or have no adverse events associated with it.‚Äù

In pre-clinical studies, however, MEAI has demonstrated promising efficacy in individuals who struggle with alcohol, helping to break the addiction cycle. Clearmind‚Äôs interest in the component came from the testimonials of people who purchased it to better manage their alcohol consumption.

As Dr. Zuloff-Shani explains in the interview, Clearmind paid attention to those experiences and the company selling the MEAI component online. Convinced of MEIA‚Äôs potential as a safe treatment option, it then acquired certain worldwide patents of MEAI used that information as an entry point for its own compound. Now, Clearmind is working on an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA as it advances toward clinical studies of MEAI next year.

‚ÄúUsually when you develop a compound, you start from the other direction. You have an idea. You develop a compound and then you go to petri dishes and to animals, and finally you walk that you will have the same signal as, as you had in animals and in petri dishes in humans,‚Äù explains Dr. Zuloff-Shani. ‚ÄúHere, we are just doing the reverse process. We understand \[MEAI\] has the potential to be effective and safe ‚Ä¶ we decided that we want to do it in a safe place and take the FDA route.‚Äù

Smith then shifts the conversation toward Clearmind‚Äôs most recent developments and the strength of its management team, staff and scientific advisory board. Dr. Zuloff-Shani describes the structure of Clearmind‚Äôs operations and how it benefits corporate objectives and overhead.

‚ÄúWe have a very impressive staff in the company,‚Äù says Dr. Zuloff-Shani, who is well-versed in navigating regulatory pathways through her more than 20 years of experience in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a lot of people, and this is by choice. We prefer to work in outsourcing because that enables us to manage our expenses better. On the other hand, it allows us to really collaborate in every field that we are dealing with.‚Äù

The interview concludes with what Clearmind expects to achieve in the New Year and how it plans to overcome the challenges associated with advancing toward clinical trials.

‚ÄúThe most important milestone we need to hit on 2023 is this IND application ‚Ä¶ this is really a major event in any company. We expect to have two clinical sites: one in the United States and one in Israel. So, it will be two applications to do different regulatory borders, asking the permission to start clinical trials, and then of course to start a clinical trial,‚Äù says Dr. Zuloff-Shani. ‚ÄúAnd then I hope that you interview me in December next year and I will tell you that we are now at the last stages of the study or reaching completion of the study.‚Äù",(NASDAQ: CMND) Is set to disrupt the mental health and addiction medicine markets with intellectual portfolio consists of seven patent families,1672843853

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street tries to recover from Tuesday‚Äôs rocky session](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures traded higher Wednesday as Wall Street tries to recover its footing after a tough first session of the year.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 55 points, or 0.17%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.23% and 0.44%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Sentiment was boosted in part by encouraging inflation data from Europe, including a greater-than-expected decline in the French consumer price index and a drop in German import prices.
*****
&gt; U.S. stocks started 2023 on a downbeat note Tuesday as rising rate concerns, high inflation and recessionary fears crushed hopes that Wall Street could kick off the new year on a positive note. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4% and 0.8%, respectively, while the Dow closed just below breakeven. The major indexes were also pressured by steep declines in Apple and Tesla shares.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúU.S. stocks were unable to hold onto earlier gains as restrictive policy and recession fears remained front and center for investors,‚Äù wrote Oanda‚Äôs senior market analyst Ed Moya in a note to clients Tuesday. ‚ÄúDiscount buying triggered another bear market rebound that didn‚Äôt last long at all.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Investors will gain more insight into what Fed members are thinking on Wednesday afternoon as minutes from the central bank‚Äôs latest policy meeting are released. Earlier in the day, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, and ISM manufacturing data are due out.
*****
&gt; Friday‚Äôs December jobs report also will be closely watched as it is the last read on the labor market before the Fed meeting in February.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIt is too early to start betting on a Fed pivot this year and that should make this difficult environment for stocks,‚Äù Moya said.

## ‚ô¶Ô∏è 1/Œ©. The contents of The Book of Fraudits were revealed by the prophet Mazars LLP.

In the interest of keeping it real The Oracle Of Tulips would like everyone to know that even she was totally not prepared for the levels of chicanery and pure *chutzpah* contained in the pages of The Book of Fraudits. ‚Äú

*Quis audit auditores* indeed.

#### üìú The Book of Fraudits Ch. 1 üìú 

Crypto.com showed the world three nearly blank pages published by an accounting firm called Mazars LLP and tried to convince the world that these pages constituted a complete and transparent view of Crypto.com‚Äôs finances even though Crypto.com had seen fit to redact all the actual dollar amounts for ‚Äúconfidentiality reasons‚Äù. 

Apparently no one explained to Kris Marszalek and the rest of Crypto.com‚Äôs executive team that confidentiality isn‚Äôt part of the audit process. In fact the word *audit* comes from the the Latin *auditus* which means ""a hearing‚Äù or ‚Äúa listening"". We use this word because undergoing an audit back in ‚Äúthe day‚Äù involved standing up in front of a crowd of old men with really severe eyebrows and the power to order your execution and explaining yourself which is literally the opposite of confidentiality.

In the end it wasn‚Äôt an issue. The world only had a few days to wonder about whether or not the accountants at Mazars LLP were actually geniuses who had invented a groundbreaking new approach to the audit process before the firm suddenly made it known that actually this was totally not an audit and they had been kidding the whole time lol. The whole specacle was kind of amazing but not as amazing as the fact that many of Crypto.com‚Äôs users were [completely convinced](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_com/) by an ‚Äúaudit‚Äù without a single number on it.

2459,StockMarket,"**OVERALL:**  Today's price action saw some very cool levels being hit or nearly hit from a technical perspective across all 3x majors.  The gap-up at the opening bell, followed by an immediate sell-off and then consolidation at the lower range of the 10-min chart candles suggests a bear-flag was built at that very micro, intraday time frame.  This is not to say tomorrow will be a continuation of that down move, just that price definitely consolidated from about 11:20 until the closing bell at the lower range of the trading day.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**: 11x days into this bear flag &amp; trading occurred across just-almost the entirty of the bear flag itself.  Price just missed doing the same head fake / fake out as we saw on IWM.  If price continues lower, nearest support remains the bottom of the flag at 374.77 -- with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low.  If price turns around &amp; heads higher, then the nearest resistance is 387.41 top of the flag, followed closely by what could be major resistance at 389.63 gap fill which is also where the 20, 50, and 100 DMAs are converging. A secondary major resistance level is at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel.

**QQQ:** Given today's price action, I will amend my ""bear flag"" measurement from December 13th to December 22nd, which means today's candle could be the 6th day of what is becoming a bear flag pattern.  Today's move to just miss that ascending TL (which had only recently become a resistance level) played out perfectly as price pulled back from the level. If price continues lower, nearest support remains 259.08 the previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.   If price turns back around &amp; heads higher, then the nearest resistance is 270.70 (that same ascending TL), but it could be 'weaker' now. If price can get through that level, there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st (also where the 20 DMA is sitting). Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.

**IWM:** 11x days into this bear flag &amp; trading occurred across just-almost the entirty of the bear flag itself.  Beautiful pierce of the flag &amp; 20 DMA, which I suspect caught many traders off guard, as price pulled back from that level into the flag as a head-fake / fake break out.  If price continues lower, 170.67 the flag's bottom is back to being a support level, followed by 169.11 the pre-COVID high. Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows.  If price turns around &amp; higher, then the nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's high. Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL.

2462,StockMarket,"First day of the season and good ol gold is already outperforming everything else.  If you were in JNUG you could have been up 6% already for the year.  Meanwhile what did SPX do?

I know roll your eyes, this is another Gold Bug who's been clamoring for Gold since the 1800s something something about fiat currencies and doomsday stuff and hiding in a bunker .. and my papa was a 49er... ACTUALLY NO!  I only hopped in gold at the end of 2022, because I see commodities (personally gold) and volatility selling strategies as the best performing asset class in 2023 AGAIN.  And because I'm so bullish on gold outperforming other asset classes, that **I'm actually hoping to get some counter arguments from the big brained folks here before I max my credit to buy gold**.

# Ok!

As you all know, while every asset class like stocks, bonds, etc... even gov treasuries crashed this year (believe it or not, your super duper safe haven super safe US treasury ETF $TLT fell 30% this year - so much for safety amirite), gold and many other commodities maintained it's value and even so in a RISING RATE environment üòÆ.  Although 2023 probably won't be as bad as 2022, I still see gold outperforming other asset classes for mostly the same reason it did in 2022.

**Why did gold outperform in 2022**?

1. Gold showed that once again it's a place where you can **really store value**.  Remember all the hype of Cryptos and all the TikTok stars clamoring cryptos are a store of value and inflation hedge and yada yada??  How's that correlation with the overall stock market work out?  How's boys like SBF and the lack of regulation work out in building investor confidence?  You think institutions will still maintain confidence in it and market it to their clients?  How's hypemen like Tom Brady and Matt Damon do for investor confidence as well?  While I believe in block chain tech, let's be honest, we are probably gonna have a winter for a bit because there isn't stimmies flowing out left and right, and let's be honest, a lot of people - the later bandwagoners, probably lost a bunch of money getting into it thinking it's a store of value and valid currency and not as a speculative asset, so probably have a bad taste in their mouths.  Oh! And mining bitcoin is bad for the environment.  You can't live in the West and be pro bitcoin or you are bad heartless person: [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/eu-will-likely-ban-bitcoin-to-no-avail](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/eu-will-likely-ban-bitcoin-to-no-avail) , just like you can't be pro fossil fuels, pro meat consumption, etc... all bad people stuff.  So it's time to get with the times and be anti-cryptos as well or eventually you are a bad person too.  And you don't want to be a bad person otherwise you end up like Putin.  Cryptos soon won't be ""vogue"" anymore when the next gen of kids get brainwashed because cryptos kill polar bears.  The powers that be are already setting this in motion.  Don't be that boomer in the next gen's eyes...
2. Gold maintained it's value in 2022 not only because it's a store of value, but also of **central bank buying**.  [https://www.ft.com/content/e0983ebb-bbe0-4d33-8517-e19fa06e1a77](https://www.ft.com/content/e0983ebb-bbe0-4d33-8517-e19fa06e1a77). I'll get into more why this is the case and why I think it will continue next.

**Why gold should continue to perform well in 2023**?

Too many reasons!

1. **Continued central bank buying**:  When war in Ukraine broke out, the West froze Russia's USD assets. [https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/russian-bank-foreign-reserve-billions-frozen-sanctions-n1292153](https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/russian-bank-foreign-reserve-billions-frozen-sanctions-n1292153)  Any country, that currently aren't simps for the West (China, Russia, India, Middle East, Turkey, South America, etc...) have immediately taken note of this unprecedented action by the west.  If they want to do ANYTHING that may be considered naughty naughty ü§≠ ü§´by the west, they could get their USD assets frozen.  Hence, the frenzy in all of these countries in trying to diversify their reserves away from USD into something else - which one of the new assets they are buying, besides something like the Yuan, is Gold: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-30/russia-to-raise-yuan-share-in-wealth-fund-to-60-gold-to-40?leadSource=uverify%20wall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-30/russia-to-raise-yuan-share-in-wealth-fund-to-60-gold-to-40?leadSource=uverify%20wall)  I see this trend to continue from now until de-globalization reverses, which could be quite a while.  This should prop up gold and other commodity prices.  The US is losing it's grip/influence in a lot of spaces in the world that's not the EU.  Saudi Arabia as an example.
   1. Heck some countries may just want to buy stuff with gold, like Ghana: [https://www.ft.com/content/403e39de-dace-4266-a525-5a36185faa82](https://www.ft.com/content/403e39de-dace-4266-a525-5a36185faa82)
2. **Reaching the terminal rates** :  Often times when rates rise, gold falls.  Yet, rates have risen by so much in 2022 yet gold has maintained it's price.  With the Fed supposedly reaching the end of the rate hikes and inflation supposedly peaking, this catalyst to decrease gold prices will eventually come off the table. [https://fortune.com/2022/12/27/gold-price-rise-2023-outlook-dollar-bitcoin-down/](https://fortune.com/2022/12/27/gold-price-rise-2023-outlook-dollar-bitcoin-down/)
3. **Persistent Inflation**: While inflation is coming down, I truly do believe that the Fed will never hit it's target of 2% inflation, without completely destroying demand and causing the country to enter a deep and tough recession.  I don't see the Fed willing to raise rates so much to do that, partly because of political pressure and partly because that just creates even more issues.  As a reuslt, both demand and supply side dynamics will continue to keep inflation above 2%
   1. **Supply Side Inflation Continues**: Everyone keeps on saying supply side inflation is ""transitory"" is the same dummies that said inflation is ""transitory"".  If the west really wanted to reduce supply side inflation, they would stop fueling the war in Ukraine.  They would stop being anti fossil fuel and anti a lot of things.  That's not ending any time soon, so supply side inflation won't stop.  Additionally, given how the west is so afraid of covid, we could once again see supply side inflation if China unleashes their population to infect the world again, leading to supply chain issues.
   2. **Demand Side Inflation Continues**: Given that the Fed probably won't bring us to a deep and serious recesssion with unemployment spiking over 10% and really crushing the demand side of things, demand will never drop low enough for inflatoin to reach 2%. Additionally, the west likes to fight inflation by handing out more money.  While the Fed can stop printing, like it's been doing, goverments themselves can continue to spend with money they don't have.  California is giving out money to fight inflation: [https://www.kcra.com/article/california-inflation-relief-payments-timeframe-update-1672447464/42371519](https://www.kcra.com/article/california-inflation-relief-payments-timeframe-update-1672447464/42371519).  Same with Spain [https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/spain-announces-106-bln-package-ease-inflation-pain-2023-2022-12-27/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/spain-announces-106-bln-package-ease-inflation-pain-2023-2022-12-27/).  Politicians live for votes, so they will never be aligned with the central bank.  Like any good corporation, they care about lining their pockets now, not necessarily do what's best.  Y**ou and I like free money, so we will never say no when a politician promises us free money for votes.  There's no end to it**.
   3. **TLDR**: Western govs like to induce inflation via their policies such as anti fossile fuel, extending the war in Ukraine, locking stuff down, etc... while handing out stimmies for votes.  The central bank must fight against all that but they can only do so much without causing a real legit recession.
   4. Example: Sellers used to sell 100 widgts and buyers bought 100 widgets.  Now only 50 widgets are availalbe due to supply constraints so the price goes up.  Only 50 widgets are now sold and some people can't afford them so they miss out.  Gov hands out stimmies so now more people can afford the 50 available widgest, so it goes up further in price.
4. **Changing Fed Inflation Target**: If the Fed can't get inflation down to 2%, that will unleash another wave of lack of confidence in the USD and fed, causing real assets to go up again.  And the Fed is already laying the groundwork for this when it realizes in 2-3 years that it can't reach it's 2% goal without causing a real and deep recession.  No one wants to go in depth yet on this stark reality, but the Fed stated in it's most recent meeting that: ""**there may be a longer-run project"" that could take a fresh look at the central bank's inflation goal**. "" [https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2022-12-14/powell-says-fed-will-not-change-2-inflation-goal](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2022-12-14/powell-says-fed-will-not-change-2-inflation-goal).  Some managers are already making this claim - the Fed just has not admit it: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/bill-ackman-says-fed-s-2-inflation-target-no-longer-credible?leadSource=uverify%20wall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/bill-ackman-says-fed-s-2-inflation-target-no-longer-credible?leadSource=uverify%20wall).  Wait for the Fed to admit it and see what happens to commodities...
5. **Debt Ceiling Volatility**: 2023 marks a year where we may have another debt ceiling crisis.  While Reps are not as fiscally conservative as they used to be, they are still 1000% more conservative than Dems these days.  If inflation is still a hot topic, they may be able to rally around being more fiscally conservative, causing a deadlock as they control the House.  Some pundits are saying that this debt ceiling crisis could be as volatilie as the one in 2011 and 1995.  In both of those situations, gold prices popped, i personally have it going up 10% in 1995 and 20% in 2011.  While this is a small move in % terms, with the low implied volatility on gold options, it's a pretty big move within a few months. [https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/economy/debt-ceiling-fight-goldman-sachs/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/economy/debt-ceiling-fight-goldman-sachs/index.html)
6. **Petrogold And Russia**: Similar to how central banks are moving away from the USD, if Russia truly gets desperate in the war in Ukraine, they could do the nuclear option and demand gold for oil/gas.  This scneario is more of a pipe dream that gold bulls like to push and is not covered by main stream media, aka it's more on the conspiracy side of things...but it's not impossible if Putin truly becomes desperate.  [https://www.kitco.com/news/2022-12-07/If-Russia-accepts-gold-for-oil-gold-price-doubles-to-3-600-says-Credit-Suisse-s-Zoltan-Pozsar.html](https://www.kitco.com/news/2022-12-07/If-Russia-accepts-gold-for-oil-gold-price-doubles-to-3-600-says-Credit-Suisse-s-Zoltan-Pozsar.html)
7. **Fed Pivot**: I personally don't see a fed pivot occuring next year given that I don't see inflation going down to 2% and I believe the Fed is going to be cautious so we don't hit a an outright recession.  Most people say fed pivot in 2H 2023, I say 2024-2025.  With that said, the financing market is very tight and MANY of your favorite negative income stocks are going to run out of cash in the next year, likely leading to higher unemployment.  If the Fed were to pivot, and start printing money again, well that'll only lead to an increase in gold prices...again!

**Why may gold not perform will in 2023**?

* **Demand Side Shock**: Any sort of demand side reduction or crazy drop in inflation, like another covid, could cause a drop in gold prices during the crisis.  However ,the aftermath/money printing and stimulus could cause gold to bounce right back up and higher than it was before.

Therefore, the anchored VWAP is helpful for long-term and short-term trading strategies. Although the anchored VWAP is the most effective for swing trading, the regular VWAP is best for day trading.¬†  


The VWAP stands for volume-weighted average price. It is a lagging indicator that tells which price the most volume of buys and sells occurred at for a trading day.¬†

If you buy a stock while trading below the VWAP, you are paying a lower price than the average trader for that day, and vice versa.¬†

Maybe the industrial sector can perform decently this year, along with healthcare and consumer staples. All three usually do alright, even when in a recession, which seems to be a matter of when and not an if anymore. The chart setups look alright as well, but I‚Äôll keep that to myself before the ‚ÄúTA is astrology for men‚Äù comments fly in lol.

As far as individual picks go, there are definitely a few companies from the sectors mentioned above that I‚Äôm eyeing to actively trade this year (I trade options mainly), but nothing has caught my attention yet when it comes to starting a swing trade or a long-term investment.

Would love to hear what stocks you‚Äôre eyeing to start building a position with or keep adding when an opportunity presents itself. Of course, if you‚Äôre day trading, I‚Äôll be more than happy to hear what you‚Äôre usually trading and if you‚Äôre adding something new to the list this year.

Bloomberg January 3, 2022

U.S. equities climbed to a record while Treasuries extended losses as traders braced for the start of a potentially volatile year and three expected rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.

The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6%, following stocks in Europe to an all-time high, as trading volume remained light with some markets still closed for holidays. The yield on the U.S. 10-year note rose 13 basis points to 1.64% -- its worst start to a year since 2009 -- and the dollar gained.

‚ÄúBottom line, the outlook is positive for stocks, but the removal of stimulus/accommodation from the global economy is a major theme to watch as we start 2022,‚Äù wrote Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded ‚ÄúThe Sevens Report‚Äù newsletter. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be the first time since 2018 that the Fed is hiking rates, and that change will impact markets throughout the year.‚Äù

Among notable stock moves, Tesla Inc. climbed 14% as the carmaker navigated supply-chain disruptions to report blowout deliveries for the fourth quarter. Apple Inc. gained, giving it a $3 trillion market value. And in Hong Kong, property shares dropped while China Evergrande Group halted trading.

As we flip the calendar over, many of the current market concerns are well known and arguably well priced in at both the index and more prominently at the average stock level,‚Äù wrote Art Hogan, chief markets strategist at National Securities. ‚ÄúWe suggest markets have done an overly efficient job in selling the rumor, and will likely start buying the news.‚Äù",On This Day in History: SP 500 Hits Record High,1672755346

2500,StockMarket,"Alleged crypto swindler Sam Bankman-Fried reportedly met with President Biden‚Äôs aides at least four times this year before he was arrested on fraud charges. 

Bankman-Fried took meetings with senior White House advisor Steve Ricchetti on at least three occasions in 2022 and met with the 80-year-old president‚Äôs deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed once in the last year, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. 

The disgraced founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX met with Ricchetti, who serves as a counselor to the president, as recently as Sept. 8, according to Bloomberg. 

Bankman-Fried‚Äôs younger brother Gabriel also reportedly participated in a meeting on May 13.

The report further demonstrates the close political connections Bankman-Fried developed in Washington before.

The Washington Free Beacon reported in November that Bankman-Fried was welcomed to the West Wing for two meetings with Ricchetti on April 22 and May 11.

The former crypto mogul is accused of defrauding investors out of at least $1.8 billion. 

Earlier this month, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to say whether Biden would ask his aides to return 2020 campaign contributions from the accused cryptocurrency con man.

Bankman-Fried, 30, was a major Democratic Party donor before the collapse of FTX, giving $50,000 to the Biden Victory Fund in October 2020 and another $2,800 directly to the Biden campaign that same month, according to Federal Election Commission records.

2540,StockMarket,"In this turbulent market environment one stock is standing out very strong to me! It has completed both the technical chart for a Head-and-Shoulders formation (and a head-and-shoulders formation is the most correct chart formations there is. (It completes 85% of its patterns on the positive side). Make sure your looking at the 3 or 5 years chart options. It closed in the spring of 2019 at $62.00 and fell to $63.55 just this past week. That is close enough to complete a pattern... Zoom maybe zooming up these next few months in spite of a bad beat-down coming to many other symbols.

Another reason for my optimism is a fundamental one, or perhaps a geopolitical one. 

The corona-virus is back and is once again quickly blooming! It was headline news for 2 years, but has now been pushed down by the politics of the day...i.e. elections and elections and Trump and civil unrest in the form of theft, as well as many politically motivated crimes.

In spite of these distractions, the hospitals are filling up again (many are already over past extremes). The tens of millions that braved traveling over the holidays are coming home (mostly to the indoors) during this brutal winter siege. It takes two weeks for the infection to disclose itself. During this two week period the Chinese are beginning to come(with the very new variant that has engulfed China these past few months). In spite of these developments, the parade rolls on!

I have a doctors' appointment next week and guess what? It's my first call for ZOOM for over a year.

I live in Florida and the ambulances have started screaming down the boulevards as they haven't done in almost a year. Read the latest news on the Corona-Virus and skip the headline news for a moment.

If you think the hospitals are full now wait until the Chinese masses hit California with the new template many of them will surely have in them. I hope not. The dots, however, are beginning to connect for me as few stocks have in my  past thirty-five years of trading.

Do I think that Zoom will once again elevate itself to a $500+ stock as it was very recently. I doubt that, but I think and feel and smell that this stock, with all that's coming down the pike, can make a stab at the $140--$150 area over the next six months. Only my opinion, though I think the gods will be dancing !!! Best of luck to you.

2581,StockMarket,[removed],Indices,1672667847
2582,StockMarket,"**Tim Draper: $250,000**

Bitcoin bull Tim Draper had one of the most optimistic calls on bitcoin of 2022, predicting the token would be worth $250,000 by the end of the year.

In November, the billionaire venture capitalist said he‚Äôs extending the timeline for that prediction until mid-2023. Even after the collapse of FTX, he‚Äôs convinced the coin will hit the quarter-of-a-million milestone.

‚ÄúMy assumption is that since women control 80% of retail spending, and only 1 in 7 bitcoin wallets are currently held by women that the dam is about to break,‚Äù Draper told CNBC via email.

Bitcoin would need to rally 1,400% in order for it to trade at that level.

Despite the depressed prices and trading volumes drying up, there could be reason to suspect the market has found a bottom, according to Draper.

‚ÄúI suspect that the halvening in 2024 will have a positive run,‚Äù he said.

The halvening, or halving, is an event that happens every four years in which bitcoin rewards to miners are cut in half. This is viewed by some investors as positive for bitcoin‚Äôs price, as it squeezes supply. The next halving is slated to happen sometime in 2024.

Bitcoin miners, who use power-intensive machines to verify transactions and mint new tokens, are being squeezed by the slump in prices and rising energy costs.

These actors accumulate massive piles of digital currency, making them some of the biggest sellers in the market. With miners offloading their holdings to pay off debts, that should remove most of the remaining selling pressure on bitcoin.

That‚Äôs historically a good sign for bitcoin, said Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development at crypto exchange Luno.

‚ÄúIn prior down markets, miner capitulation has usually indicated major bottoms,‚Äù Ayyar told CNBC. ‚ÄúTheir cost to produce becomes greater than the value of bitcoin, hence you have a number of miners either switching off their machines ‚Ä¶ or they need to sell more bitcoin to keep their business afloat.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf the market reaches a point where it‚Äôs absorbing this miner sell pressure sufficiently, one can assume that we‚Äôre seeing a bottoming period.‚Äù

**Standard Chartered: $5,000**

For some market participants, the worst is yet to come.

In a Dec. 5 research note, Standard Chartered said bitcoin may sink as low as $5,000. The prediction, one of the bank‚Äôs list of ‚Äúsurprises‚Äù that are being ‚Äúunder-priced‚Äù by markets, would represent a 70% plunge from current prices.

‚ÄúYields plunge along with technology shares‚Äù in Standard Chartered‚Äôs nightmare 2023 scenario, ‚Äúand while the Bitcoin sell-off decelerates, the damage has been done,‚Äù said Eric Robertsen, the bank‚Äôs global head of research.

‚ÄúMore and more crypto firms and exchanges find themselves with insufficient liquidity, leading to further bankruptcies and a collapse in investor confidence in digital assets,‚Äù he added.

Robertsen said the scenario has a ‚Äúnon-zero probability of occurring in the year ahead‚Äù and falls ‚Äúmaterially outside of the market consensus or our own baseline views.‚Äù

**Mark Mobius: $10,000**

Veteran investor Mark Mobius had a relatively successful 2022 in terms of his price call. In May, he forecast bitcoin would drop to $20,000 when it was trading above $28,000.

He said bitcoin would fall to $10,000 in 2022. That did not happen. However, Mobius told CNBC that he is sticking for his $10,000 price call in 2023.

The investor, who made his name at Franklin Templeton Investments, told CNBC that his bear case for bitcoin stemmed from rising interest rates and general tighter monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

‚ÄúWith higher interest rates, the attraction of holding or buying Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies becomes less attractive since just holding the coin does not pay interest,‚Äù Mobius said via email.

**Carol Alexander: $50,000**

Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, wasn‚Äôt far off the mark with her prediction that bitcoin would slip to $10,000 in 2022.

Now, she thinks the cryptocurrency could be set for gains ‚Äî but not for reasons you might expect.

The catalyst would be more dominos from the FTX fallout tipping over, Alexander said. If this happens, she expects the price of bitcoin will top $30,000 in the first quarter, and then $50,000 by quarters three or four.

‚ÄúThere will be a managed bull market in 2023, not a bubble ‚Äî so we won‚Äôt see the price overshooting as before,‚Äù she told CNBC.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see a month or two of stable trending prices interspersed with range-bounded periods and probably a couple of short-lived crashes.‚Äù

Alexander‚Äôs reasoning is that, with trading volumes evaporating with traders on edge, large holders known as ‚Äúwhales‚Äù will likely step in to prop up the market. The wealthiest 97 bitcoin wallet addresses account for 14.15% of the total supply, according to fintech firm River Financial.

I still think we should keep an eyes on this things, maybe more stimulus will come on board, however many economist are saying this will still make inflation go up, i dont see much impact of this on the demand side, however the supply side is very less, and yet the spending is still high, so they might be right but i think its not the case, also one of the Bills passed is the AID for Ukraine, at some point we could see the war between Russia and Ukraine stop, due to the constant backings from the US, as we all know this War  between Russia and Ukraine has been part of the reason the market dropped, my major fear now is that the Dollars might keep dropping as we see Russia and China trying to pull out of the $ which is the Global reserve, this was as a result of the freezing of Russia accounts,  if this happens  Dxy will drop hard, and one of the means to send the dollar up is to hike rates, they did this before will they do it again?? we cant tell but watch all these macro indicators, and see what comes in the first quarter of 2023, i somehow think we are likely to get a recession.",Biden administration $1.7trillion bill,1672609857

I have managed my own portfolio for 3 years and 2 months now with a return of 22% on a total of 43 trades. I have recently moved to solely options in the past 11 months. on the 21st will be a full year with the account netting a profit of 43%. I am psychopathic when it comes to money and stocks as I have realized my potential. I have adopted this crazy money driven mindset in the past year where all I think about is money and dedicate about 6 hrs a day to the market. I don't value school as I am a junior and the only class I take that I value is my AP Econ class. I have a 50 year personalized flow chart till I plan to retire at about 65. I caddie at a very prestigious golf club where I interact with very many high profile individuals and have two possible internships lined up this summer because of people I have met and connections I have made (I caddie literally 1-2 times every single day in the summer). It sounds crazy but I have everything planned down to the year. I have very many possibilities in the sector though. I feel I will most likely go to college for Finance, hop around a bit with a firm, until I eventually start my own hedge fund (it will happen). I believe the connections I have made and will continue to make will provide very generous seed funding for my plan and I believe as I have only known trading in the bear market, I will succeed even more in the bull. If anyone out there has a similar mindset, experience, and can give me any advice on what you did or what happened to you I would greatly appreciate it. I will also note that I am the 2022 Huntington stock market champion (out of over 5000 teenagers) and am leading this years competition with a current portfolio value of $155,000 while 2nd place is $120,000 as an appeal to credibility.

The value of a company is the present value of discounted future cash flows, and analyst consensus compiled by FactSet indicates that Tesla is expected to take the lead in cash flow in the automotive industry in 2023. Tesla has been growing their free cash flow at a rapid clip (from $1B in 2019, to $2.8B in 2020, to $5B in 2021), and is expected to continue to grow to $23.6B free cash flow by 2027 with sales of around 3.3 million automobiles (compared $10B free cash flow on 1.3 million units in 2022) as well as car software, car insurance, car service, car charging, and energy products. Meanwhile, the other automakers free cash flow is mostly stagnant, and is expected to decline as they are required to make large investments to catch up on EVs trends while selling EVs at slim and even negative profit margins. Simultaneously, rising EV adoption may cause significant declines in residual values for gasoline powered cars, and imperil the previously very profitable blue chip financing arms of major automakers.

Tesla has earned its spot as the most valuable automaker. The question remains - how many times more valuable?",Automotive industry 2023 estimated free cash flows (billions),1672595453

2626,StockMarket,"**2023 PREDICTIONS:**

**SPY Best -- 431SPY Mid -- 318SPY Worst -- 273**

**QQQ Best -- 335QQQ Mid -- 211QQQ Worst -- 165**

**IWM Best -- 216IWM Mid -- 152IWM Worst -- 141**

^(Best = Highest level I could see the index hitting if it breaks out early from its bear channel)  
^(Mid = Most likely low before the index goes sideways/consolidates out of its bear channel)  
^(Worst = Lowest level I could see the index hitting if price collapses below its bear channel)

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**:  Price is decidedly in a descending, bearish channel since breaking down from ATHs in late 2021/early 2022.  This channel has been tested 3x thus far in 2022 without any sign of its upper TL weakening; however, the steep descending angle is likely not sustainable for the entirity of 2023.  Therefore, the first support level which could give the pivot/bounce which truly tests this bear channel is likely 339.08 the pre-COVID pivot high.

However, if this level fails to give a sufficient-enough bounce, then a nearby level at 321.28 is a retrace area from the COVID V-shape breakout.  The 318 - 321 level is fascinating, because it not only includes that aforementioned retrce level, but is also near the 61.8% Fib retrace (318.24) from the 2020 COVID low to 2022 ATH -- and urthermore -- this level will coincidentally intersect the upper TL of our bearish channel in mid-to-late 2023 if price cannot challenge (or potentially breakout) beforehand.  And as if that was not enough, also coming together at this mid-to-end of 2023 intersection point is another major support level: the ascending TL which formed off the 2008-2009 financial crisis pivot low, which is a level only pierced during COVID.

If price falls at the fastest rate its current channel predicts, and in doing so cuts right through all of those major support factors before mid-2023, then price will hit another major support level at 305.70 the ascending TL off the 2008-2009 financial crisis.  And if price just utterly collapses in 2023, then the final major support level I could see it reaching in 2023 is at 273.50 where the current descending support TL from the January 2022 pivot ATH will cross the 2007 pre-financial crisis pivot ATH...this TL is also where price retraced in 2019 and 2020.

On the more positive side -- if the bounce which comes off one of those support levels breaks through the bear channel, and on a retest of that channel TL we see even more upside, then the max upside I could see hitting this year is 431.73 where the floor (now ceiling) was put in from September 2021 to June 2022.  Reaching this level would require price to breakout through those multiple pivot highs which previously tested the bear channel's upper TL; therefore, what could be more likely on the ""bull"" side of the market is a choppy year which consolidates at-then-through those now-resistance levels.

https://preview.redd.it/vkwuphwfvf9a1.jpg?width=2296&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad93d7760d3448e39301f3408031feba8c63f89b

**QQQ**:  Compared to the S&amp;P and Russell, the NASDAQ experienced a more parabolic rise -- and as a result -- has fallen at a faster rate.  The NASDAQ already bounced 1x off the 61.8% Fib retrace from the COVID-low to the November 2021 ATHs; therefore, I do not expect this level will provide long term support in 2023, e.g. the momentum needed to breakout of its bear channel.

The nearest level of support which could give this type of bounce may be the confluence between  234.93 the pre-COVID pivot high, and an ascending TL off the 2007-2008 financial crisis pivot highs (which, coincidentally, is currently within the bear channel and cutting through the pre-COVID high level).  Depending on the QQQ's rate of descent, these 2x support levels will intersect with the current upper TL of the bear channel in mid-to-late 2023, much like certain intersections on the SPY chart.  All of that said, I still do not believe this will be the pivot low in 2023; instead, I believe the QQQ needs to retest at least 225.88 the 75% Fib retrace, but more likely 211.71 where price pierced/retraced during the COVID V-shape recovery.  Interestingly, these 2x more practical levels (to me anyway) are scheduled to intersect the bear channel's upper TL in late-2023.

However, when you look at just how much the QQQ has risen compared to IWM or SPY, it does seem conceivable that price could do a full 100% retrace of 164.93 the COVID-lows...

On the more positive side -- if the bounce which comes off one of those support levels breaks through the bear channel, and on a retest of that channel TL we see even more upside, then the max upside I could see hitting this year is 315.59 the 31.8% Fib retrace level up to 334.42 where price pierced that Fib level during the past year's decline.  Reaching this level would require price to breakout through multiple pivot highs which previously tested the bear channel's upper TL; therefore, what could be more likely on the ""bull"" side of the market is a choppy year which consolidates at-then-through those now-resistance levels.

https://preview.redd.it/uwe291phvf9a1.jpg?width=2300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e24b51bec09e568f352e7355adff7425d66a74c4

**IWM**:  Compared to the S&amp;P, the Russell is closer to the same type of major support levels; for example, the SPY is testing its 31.8% Fib retrace vs the IWM testing its 50% Fib retace.  And yet unlike the NASDAQ (which is testing its 61.8% Fib retrace vs the Russell's 50% Fib), the Russell did not experience the same parabolic climb to ATHs; therefore, the NASDAQ should be expected to be seeing a bigger pull back.  As a result, IWM may be a leading indicator during 2023 in terms of when the bottom is put in across all 3x major indices...assuming the bottom comes as part of a more natural market cycle (e.g. grinding lower to a definitive pivot point, then turning higher) than a 'flash event' (e.g. similar to what we see looking back at COVID).

The nearest major support level is 162.76 triple bottom, and while this level is being bolstered by an ascending support TL coming off the 2008-2009 financial crisis pivot low, the macro consolidation which has occurred at/near these levels since mid-2022 is enough to make me question is either level will give the IWM enough momentum to break out of its bear channel.  Instead, I believe a more likely level to challenge the bear channel will come around 152 where price pivoted &amp; retraced during the COVID V-shape recovery, as well as the 61.8% Fib retrace from the 2020 COVID low to November 2021 ATH (as mentioned, QQQ already retraced to its 61.8% Fib level).  If this level cannot at least shift the IWM into sideways chop/consolidation out of the bear channel, then the lowest point from a technical perspective in 2023 could be 141 - 145 where the current resistance descending TL intersects with an ascending TL from the 2008 pre-financial crisis pivot high to a retrace from the 2018 pivot low.

On the more positive side -- if price can breakout of the bear channel &amp; then retest the channel's upper TL, the max upside could be 216 which is where the floor (now ceiling) was put in from January 2021 to January 2022.  However &amp; similar to SPY &amp; IWM, to reach this level would require moves that breakout through 2x major ascending resistance TLs.  Instead, a more likely ""bullish"" case could be sideways chop/consolidation at-and-through these levels.

2650,StockMarket," This is my plan and should not be traded by anyone but me. Markets are closed Monday 1/2/23.

***Recap***: Markets provided some New Year‚Äôs fireworks on the final trading day of 2022, with the S&amp;P futures moving up 40 points in the final hour of trading on Friday and into the runoff period. Unsurprisingly, markets were largely in balance over the Christmas holiday and intervening week into the new year. From December 16 through the 30th, markets mostly drifted between **3808** and **3883**, indicating a market that is in balance; both buyers and sellers agree on value.

***Balance/Trend***: Though the market is currently in balance, we have to consider both bigger trends at play: there was a clean down trend for the 2022 bear market and a similarly clean trend up since October.

***Analysis***: Contraction in markets leads to expansion, and the market‚Äôs recent sluggishness during the holidays should lead to more explosive movement soon. The decrease in volatility is shown by the white wedge in the chart, which gives breakout levels to each side of it at **3870** and **3820**. 

The bullish trend is intact as long as **3820** holds, and just below that is the **3808** level where the balance zone low is found. These two supports are confluent with the white triangle support as well, and as usual, support is not an exact price level, but a zone that uses these two levels.

We also need to consider what happened for all of November and a good bit of December: the market was broadly balanced between **3920** and **4040**. After finally breaking down below **3920** on 12/16, the market retested this level on 12/21 and rejected it. 

***Plan***:

* As mentioned, **3820** is an important support in the bull trend and must be held. I like to see the market test below it, perhaps as low as the **3808** level and recapture it for a long targeting **3857** and **3870-77**. 
* If we get a stronger move that breaks out cleanly from the **3870** above the triangle, there‚Äôs a good chance that the market will attempt to break back into **3920**. If the market is able to move inside, we could potentially see some consolidation around **3927**, the 12/10 weekly vPOC, as the market sees if there is acceptance back inside this range. 
* A sustained move into the balance range should test **3951** before buyers will need to break into time value from the week of 12/10. I would try longs on a break through and backtest of the level.
* The market remains in the wedge, coiling further, below **3880**. If the market attempts to break out of the wedge and comes back inside the **3870-3873** range (weekly volume value high), then I would attempt a short targeting **3852-57** and **3820**.
* If the market finds resistance at **3920** on another retest there, this could be a good short for me targeting a backtest of the wedge at **3870-77**. 

If the market moves down next week, then I would look for shorts below **3820**. However, I would cut early if there‚Äôs not a good, clean trend down. I would want to see the market clear **3808** for confirmation, and in a short trade, I would target **3764** and **3752**.

# **Stocks fall to end Wall Street‚Äôs worst year since 2008, S&amp;P 500 finishes 2022 down nearly 20% - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks slipped on Friday to end a brutal 2022 with a whimper, as Wall Street wrapped up its worst year since 2008 on a sour note.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 73.55 points, or 0.22%, to close at 33,147.25. The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.25% to end at 3,839.50. The Nasdaq Composite ticked down 0.11% to 10,466.88.
*****
&gt; Friday marked the final day of trading in what has been a painful year for stocks. All three of the major averages suffered their worst year since 2008 and snapped a three-year win streak. The Dow fared the best of the indexes in 2022, down about 8.8%. The S&amp;P 500 sank 19.4%, and is more than 20% below its record high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 33.1%.
*****
&gt; Sticky inflation and aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve battered growth and technology stocks and weighed on investor sentiment throughout the year. Geopolitical concerns and volatile economic data also kept markets on edge.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had everything from Covid problems in China to the invasion of Ukraine. They‚Äôve all been very serious. But for investors, it is what the Fed is doing,‚Äù said Art Cashin, director of floor operations for UBS, on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Exchange.‚Äù
*****
&gt; As the calendar turns to a new year, some investors think the pain is far from over. They expect the bear market to persist until a recession hits or the Fed pivots. Some also project stocks will hit new lows before rebounding in the second half of 2023.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI would love to tell you that it is going to be like the ‚ÄòWizard of Oz‚Äô and everything is going to be in glorious color in a moment or two. I think we may have a bumpy first quarter, and depending on the Fed it may last a little longer than that,‚Äù Cashin said.
*****
&gt; Despite the yearly losses, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 did break three-quarter losing streaks in the final three months of the year. The Nasdaq, however, dominated by the likes of Apple, Tesla and Microsoft, muddled through its fourth consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2001. All three averages are negative for December, however.
*****
&gt; Communication services was the worst performing sector in the S&amp;P 500 this year, falling more than 40%, followed by consumer discretionary. Energy was the only sector to rise, climbing 59%.

&gt; # One Year's Loss Is Not the Next Year's Gain

&gt; It's finally the last trading day of what has been a tough year for most asset classes, especially equities. As of this writing, the S&amp;P 500 is on pace to finish the year with a 19.83% loss. Over the course of the index's history, there have only been nine other years in which the S&amp;P 500 has fallen at least 15% for the full year. Of course, turning the page of the calendar does not mean all the issues dragging stocks lower magically go away, and a big decline one year does not in and of itself mean we're due for a big gain the next year.

&gt; In the chart below we plot the annual percentage change of the S&amp;P 500 versus its move the following year. Taking a linear regression shows that performance one year is not a good explainer for next-year performance with a miniscule R squared of 0.0003. Looking just at those years where the S&amp;P fell 15%+, five times the index posted gains the next year, while four times the index posted further declines.

&gt; # Let‚Äôs Look at Stocks Down Two Years in A Row

&gt; As bad as 2022 has been for investors, there is a silver lining: back-to-back declines in the S&amp;P 500 are rarer than you may think.

&gt; If you go all the way back to 1950, the only times that stocks fell in back-to-back years were during the vicious recession of 1973/1974 and then three years in a row during the tech bubble implosion of the early 2000s. Fortunately, we don‚Äôt see similar scenarios within the current environment, so I think the odds could favor a snapback in 2023.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-193.png))**

&gt; Taking a closer look into the data, we found:

&gt; * The year after, a negative return saw the S&amp;P 500 up 15% on average and higher 80% of the time.
&gt; *A 10% (or greater) loss showed the following year up only 8.5% on average and higher 63.6% of the time.
&gt; *Out of the 20 negative years, only three times did returns get worse the following year (in 1974, 2001, and 2002).
&gt; *However, the following year, significant losses were rewarded as 20% or more declines saw the next year higher all three times and up 27.1% on average (in 1975, 2003, and 2009).
&gt; *Somewhat surprising to me is the year after a positive year, the returns were only 7.1% on average and higher 68.6% of the time. Take note that the average year since 1950 gained 9.5% and was higher 71.2% of the time.

&gt; # What Happens When Everyone Agrees That Stocks Will Fall?

&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what you look at that matters; it‚Äôs what you see.‚Äù Henry David Thoreau

&gt; I‚Äôve done this for more than two decades, and I have to say, the general consensus remains that the first half of next year will be rough for stocks, while the second half of the year should be better. But let‚Äôs be clear, overall, the general consensus is that next year will be rough for investors (as we explained here).

&gt; The last time I can recall everyone agreeing on something like this was in 2012 and the fiscal cliff drama. Seriously, it is all anyone talked about in the second half of 2012, and the big worry was that it would wreak havoc on stocks and the economy in the first half of 2013 and beyond. Guess what happened? Stocks soared nearly 30% in 2013, and the economy did just fine.

&gt; You see, the stock market is always pricing things in, and if everyone is talking about it, you better believe the stock market is aware. As Lou Holtz once said, ‚ÄúLife is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you respond to it.‚Äù We are in the midst of one of the worst years ever for investors, and the general consensus is that next year will be bad, also. So the question is, how are we supposed to respond to this?

&gt; What amazes me is how bearish everyone is. Yet, we have inflation coming down very quickly, an economy (while notably slowing, for sure) that we believe is not likely to be headed to a recession (in part, thanks to a very strong consumer), and some of the historically best times to invest based on the calendar.

&gt; That‚Äôs right, the first quarter in a pre-election year has been positive an incredible 17 out of 18 times going back to 1950. Oh, it was also up 7.4% on average (the very best quarter out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle). On top of that, the second quarter has also performed quite well, too. So, we potentially have an interesting situation brewing here, and I sure don‚Äôt hear too many people pointing out any of the more optimistic news or perspectives.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/spx-quarterly-returns.png))**

&gt; Now go back to the quote at the very beginning about what you look at versus what you see. To me, I look at all the worries and concerns as everyone else, but what I see is the potential for a surprise rally that not many are expecting.

&gt; # 2022 Solidified as the Worst Year for Sentiment

&gt; As we noted in an earlier post, today's release of the AAII survey gives us the final reading of the year on sentiment, solidifying a number of points as to just how dour the investor outlook has been.

&gt; For starters, the bull-bear spread heavily favors bears, and that has been the case for some time now. As shown below, the spread has been negative (meaning a higher share of respondents are reporting as bearish than bullish) for a record 39 weeks in a row- over a month longer than the previous record which occurred recently in 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-3a.png))**

&gt; Across all weeks in 2022, bullish sentiment averaged a reading of merely 24.73%. Since the survey began in 1987, that is a record low. In fact, the previous lowest readings were a few percentage points higher at 27.29% and 27.08% in 1988 and 1990, respectively. Meanwhile, the average reading on bearish sentiment was historically elevated at a record of 46.2%, surpassing the prior record set in 2008 by one percentage point. Prior to 2008/2009, only 1990 saw a very high average reading for bearish sentiment.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-Year-1.png))**

&gt; As we highlighted in an earlier tweet, given the low readings on bullish sentiment, there was not even a single week this year in which bullish sentiment came in above its historical average of 37.63%. Of course with a low share of survey respondents reporting as bullish, a larger share would be reporting as bearish. To match the impressive reading with no weeks seeing above-average bullish sentiment, nearly every week this year (51) has seen bearish sentiment come in above its historical average of 31%, tying the record high set in 2009.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-Year-3.png))**

&gt; As previously mentioned, bullish sentiment averaged a reading below 25% this year. Given that reading, it should come as no surprise that 2022 also saw a record number of weeks (30) with bulls below 25%. Prior to this year, 1988 (one year after the survey began) was the prior record at 23 weeks. In other words, this year there were nearly two months more in which less than a quarter of investors reported as bullish than the previous record. Additionally, there had been 17 weeks in which over half of the responses were bearish. Similar to the number of weeks in which bearish sentiment was above average, that ties 2008 for the record high.

&gt; # Grinch visits Wall Street on Last Trading Day of Year

&gt; Last-minute tax-loss selling, old sayings such as ‚Äúyear ends make great exits,‚Äù a desire to start with a clean slate, who knows exactly the answer, but the last trading day of the year has turned bearish over the last twenty-two years. Since 2000, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have the worst records. On the last trading day of the year, NASDAQ has been down in sixteen of the last twenty-two years after having been up twenty-nine years in a row from 1971 to 1999. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have also been struggling recently and exhibit a bearish bias over the last twenty-two years. Russell 2000‚Äôs record very closely resembles NASDAQ, gains every year from 1979 to 1999 and only six advances since.

&gt; # Country ETFs in 2022

&gt; Earlier today we published our Global Macro Dashboard which provides an overview of the main economic and market data of 22 major global economies. In the table below, we show the recent performance of the ETFs tracking those same countries.

&gt; With 2022 drawing to a close, there are only two countries that are currently in the green for the year: Brazil (EWZ) and Mexico (EWW). Neither are up much, but up is up, especially in a year like this one.

&gt; In terms of month-to-date change, Hong Kong (EWH) has risen the most with a 5.62% gain, while China (MCHI) is up a modest 0.46%. On the other end of the spectrum, Taiwan (EWT) has fallen sharply with an over 20% decline, but most of that drop is actually due to a $5.18/share long-term capital gain that the fund paid out earlier this month.

&gt; # Pre-Election Year Januarys Stellar - #1 S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, #2 DJIA

&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations has historically propelled stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but sixth on the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA since 1950. January is the last month of the best three-consecutive-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.

&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2022 as both indices suffered losses in thirteen of those twenty-three Januarys with three in a row in: 2008 to 2010, 2014 to 2016 and then again from 2020 to 2022. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1930 respectively. Covid-19 spoiled January in 2020 &amp; 2021 as DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all suffered declines in 2020. In 2021, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 declined. In 2022, surging inflation, reaching multi-decade highs, stoked fears of substantially higher interest rates in January.

&gt; However, in pre-election years, Januarys have been outright stellar ranking #1 for S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 and #2 for DJIA. Average gains range from 3.4% by Russell 1000 to a whopping 6.8% for NASDAQ. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have only declined twice in pre-election Januarys, 2015 and 2003.

&gt; NYSE's FAANG+ index is described as an index of ""10 of today's highly-traded tech giants."" Given that most of the FAANG+ stocks account for a massive portion of the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500, they are an impactful group. As shown below, the FAANG+ index peaked in early November last year and has dropped 46% since then. The drop more recently follows a failed breakout above the top of its downtrend channel as the index is now back to within 5% of this past November's low. On a relative basis, the group has been underperforming the broader market for even longer with a high in February of last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122822-FAANG-1.png))**

&gt; Below is a look at the ten FAANG+ stocks. As shown, they came into the year with a combined market cap of $12.3 trillion, and they're ending the year with a combined market cap of just over $7 trillion. While Apple (AAPL) has fallen the least YTD in terms of share price change, it has lost the most in market cap at $844 billion. Amazon (AMZN) has seen its market cap fall the second-most at $843 billion, essentially getting cut in half. Tesla (TSLA), along with AMZN, is one of two names that lost their ""$1 trillion market cap"" club status this year. TSLA is now down 69% on the year, and its market cap has fallen from $1.06 trillion down to just $344 billion. The other FAANG+ stocks that are down 50%+ on the year include Meta (META), NVIDIA (NVDA), Netflix (NFLX), AMD, and Snowflake (SNOW).

&gt; With markets continuing to drop in these final trading days of December, on an absolute basis, 2022 is going to go down as the biggest year of wealth destruction ever for the US equity market. In 2008, the Russell 3,000 saw its market cap fall by $6.7 trillion. As of today, the Russell 3,000's market cap has fallen about $11.2 trillion so far in 2022. $5.2 trillion of that $11.2 trillion decline has come from just the ten FAANG+ stocks shown below.

**The Strategy**

My strategy is based upon a concentrated value investing approach. I like to perform deep fundamental research to find and buy a stake in companies that I find value in. I like to hold 12 to 15 stocks diversified among various industries to diversify against any black swan events. This strategy offers my portfolio enough downside protection while also leaving enough room for my best ideas to play out. I protect the portfolio from serious losses by performing deep fundamental research and by using a margin of safety, not by avoiding or minimizing volatility. I see stocks as parts of businesses and analyze and value them according to that principle. This includes both buying low and buying the companies with a high discount to their intrinsic value. When you minimize losses and allocate capital when the odds are in your favor, you don‚Äôt lose and when you win, you win big. That is the backbone of a concentrated value approach.

I do not hold restrictions on portfolio management and can allocate a larger part of my portfolio to one or several stocks. I furthermore do not yield any restrictions to potential investments. Such restrictions harm the ability to invest freely and to fully deploy my strategy and can even diminish performance. This includes market caps, industries, ESG restrictions, portfolio sizes, number of stocks and country of origin. I hold 12-15 stocks because I like it that way, it leaves enough room for opportunities while making sure you deeply understand both your investments and your entire portfolio. I allocate capital based upon a risk/reward scenario whereas all positions (and sizes) are constructed according to that principle. If the numbers are simply too good, I may allocate more capital to that opportunity, certainly if the risk is contained or minimized towards the downside. 

**Volatility**

Basic mathematical principles tell us that to maximize our upside returns, firstly we need to minimize the downside as lost dollars are harder to replace (i.e. a 33% drop needs a 50% gain to breakeven). I do not hedge the portfolio with various instruments as hedging is surrendering towards the idea that you are unsure about your portfolio and individual positions. I hold securities and maintain a decent cash position to allocate capital to various opportunities presented by the market without the need to sell off other positions. Trying to avoid losses is done by deeply fundamental research and buying stocks cheaply and not by hedging your uncertain positions by buying various financial instruments. One could argue that buying dollar bills for 50 cents and therefore stocks that are cheaply priced towards their intrinsic value is all the hedging an equity portfolio requires.

I do not think that volatility is related to risk or risk of losses and the portfolio is therefore not constructed to minimize volatility. Each investor should understand that a concentrated value approach yields an above average high level of volatility and should not confuse volatility with risk (as is common in modern day finance). Again, risk is minimized not through building statistical models regarding volatility but rather through respectful and deep business evaluation and research. Traditional risk management considers beta, also known as market risk, as a measure of volatility or systematic risk of an individual stock in comparison to the entire market. According to that idea, risk management would therefore be appropriate to diversify in a lot of stocks to smooth out volatility and still be rewarded with an appropriate return. If you include enough stocks to eventually resemble the index volatility, then your returns will eventually resemble the index that you are so desperately trying to beat and doom yourself to mediocre performance. Deep business evaluation and research is ought to be useless as the efficient market assigns the correct values to all businesses. The entire finance industry operates mainly to the same models and therefore increases the volatility and opportunities presented by the market, so volatility can also be a tool to buy a good stock for a high discount relative to its intrinsic value.

**Warren Buffet:** ""The riskiness of an investment is not measured by beta (a Wall Street term encompassing volatility and often used in measuring risk) but rather by the probability of that investment causing its owner a loss of purchasing power over his contemplated holding period. Assets can fluctuate greatly in price and not be risky as long as they are reasonably certain to deliver increased purchasing power over their holding period."" (2011)

**The Portfolio**

I try to stay away from the most popular stock in the most popular industry. I do not assign any indicative value towards securities other than the value I find in them by performing deep fundamental research. I do not allocate capital towards businesses simply because they are popular, well-known, would make the portfolio look great on paper or are fun to talk about on your nephew‚Äôs birthday party. Peter Lynch prefers to avoid the hottest stock in the hottest industry; stocks that are heralded as the next big something; longshot companies at the cusp of solving the latest national problem; and stocks with the most exciting name. He also dislikes whisper stocks that attract imaginative, complicated, and emotionally appealing stories. Stocks that receive significant positive attention have greater risk of being over-bought and over-priced. High growth businesses in popular industries with low barrier to entry attracts a lot of competition and imitation. I tend to agree with him.

To the contrary, my strategy may well be exactly the opposite: I try to find beaten down unpopular undervalued stocks in disfavored industries. For these stocks the downward risk most of the times already happened, there is high emotion involved and some stories are not fully understood. These turnaround stories also have the highest potential for increases in returns. I focus on companies based upon EV/EBITDA ratio since I believe that to be a better measure of profitability and the value assigned to a company. I furthermore focus on free cash flow as that provides businesses opportunities to deploy their capital and achieve shareholder returns. I like companies that are buying back shares and have management that is shareholder friendly oriented. I furthermore like ''rare bird'' stocks that offer special stories and opportunities such as spinoffs, asset plays, arbitrage opportunities and turnarounds because of the asymmetric risk/reward ratio involved. Some companies are so cheaply priced that there seems almost no further downside risk to that specific scenario. I furthermore like companies with recent catalysts that would make it hard to analyze and value the company correctly such as mergers, scandals or trouble, therefore creating opportunities for the observant investor. I calculate and adjust the financial statements to recent situations to derive at my fair value of the company which most of the time is not in line with the price attached to the company by the market.  

I hold my positions for the long term if the fundamentals of the stock stay the same or improve. I sell when my profit target (value) is reached. Although my potential profit could be higher when I hold on just a little longer, in the entire history of humanity, no one has ever gone broke taking profits. If the company does change fundamentally or they don‚Äôt show good prospects, I close the position and look for new opportunities. Investing requires both ‚Äò‚Äôscience and art‚Äô‚Äô from the individual investor to form his qualified opinion and specific investment actions. The more qualitative ‚Äòart‚Äô of investing is hard to explicitly state on paper and although I love to elaborate further about the portfolio selection criteria, I think those are best explained below by the current holdings in our portfolio.

**2023 Outlook**

The past year saw a moderate decline in stock prices and the market decline has created greater opportunities among undervalued situations with positive long-term outlook for potential returns. I specifically use the word ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô since casual reading of recent media outlets would suggest that the decline is much greater. One could argue to be ‚Äògreedy when others are fearful‚Äô as we saw a lot of fear in the market in the past year. This does not, however, suggest that the market is unable to decline more and create both further investment losses and bargain situations in the stock market. As I do not attempt to forecast stock prices in the short or medium term, I have no idea whether broad market indexes will rise, fall or go sideways for the upcoming year, period or decade. Although past performance is no guarantee for future results, it is a rather useful indicator because the one constant in financial markets is human nature and human nature can be highly emotional, volatile and irrational. If you would compare the 2022 bear market with historical bear markets this would suggest more pain ahead but then again the economic situation and outlook may well be different from those economic situations in the past that accompanied historic market drawdowns.

I do think that the short-term outlook is rather negative across financial markets and that such negative outlooks in the past have been good moments for opportunities in the markets. I furthermore think that our portfolio is well suited for potential long-term returns and potential short-term volatility.  We hold a decent cash allocation in the portfolio to buy a) any of the undervalued opportunities Mr. Market presents to us or b) to increase our positions in our current holdings. 

I do not pretend to be able to predict market movements in the short-term and would feel that any energy used in this endeavor would take energy away from my main tasks. I rather spend my energy looking at the investment opportunities not the condition of the general market itself. That will be our 2023 strategy. Please consider that our concentrated equity portfolio is one of high volatility and act accordingly. I personally have invested a large part of my net worth in the Fund and I hold no other equity securities. My entire professional focus is in this Eurykleia Fund and I therefore believe our goals and returns to be aligned. 

**Our Current Portfolio**

Our portfolio currently consists of 12 marketable securities that are discussed in more detail individually below. I believe all holdings to be undervalued and for that reason have included them in the portfolio. Traditional risk management would suggest that our portfolio contains a high level of risk since it is not diversified into many stocks. In fact, traditional risk management is right in the fact that this portfolio has a high level of market volatility but is wrong in assuming that volatility is in any way related to risk. I do not include company A because I also hold company B and consequently pretend that that addition to the portfolio would in any way decrease the portfolio risk of serious investment losses. To the contrary, adding various random businesses without the deep fundamental research required upfront just for the sake of ‚Äòdiversification‚Äô would only worsen the portfolio outlook and increase the risk of serious losses. 

The portfolio is structured and prepared for a wide variety of potential economic situations in the upcoming year. All of our holdings are cash flow generating businesses that generate a high stream of free cash flow and do not depend upon the interest rates dictated by central banks for their growth and survival. We hold 15% of our portfolio in cash to take advantage of opportunities provided to us by the market. 

We have allocated 25% of our capital to **Brookfield Corporation** and **Brookfield Asset Management** since there is value to be found in both businesses due to their recent spinoff of the asset manager. We hold 16% of our portfolio in two oil and gas producers (**Ovintiv** and **Diamondback Energy**) as the low allocation of capital in the industry and the shareholder friendly attitude of management provides opportunities for the coming period. We have furthermore some exposures to retail businesses that may be impacted by a dooming recession but a) these businesses together make up only 15% of the portfolio and b) these businesses are priced so cheaply that they are priced for a suggested bankruptcy instead of a potential recession.

**Brookfield Corporation (14.86%)**

Brookfield is a Canadian alternative asset manager that currently has over $750 billion assets under management across real estate, infrastructure, renewable power and transition, private equity, and credit. Brookfield furthermore holds equity investments in both their own investment funds and subsidiary businesses of $35 billion as well as a sizeable amount of $125 billion cash that can be deployed in their funds and the markets. They have grown their funds from operations annually by 15%. The recent downturn in the market means that they both must adjust the fair value of their investments to market prices and have more cheaper opportunities to deploy their vast amount of capital. More recently, they have distributed 25% of their asset management businesses towards shareholders in a recent spinoff. The Corporation, post spinoff, will own circa $150 billion of private and listed investments, including a 75% interest in the newly listed Manager. 

Brookfield is known for building high growing businesses from scratch and eventually deploying them on the equity markets. They have done so successfully with their asset manager. Currently they are already building their next high profitable and strongly growing business: Brookfield Insurance Solutions which contributed with increased earnings to the distributable earnings that have grown by 39%. By holding our shares in the corporation, we own a claim on the profits received from all businesses owned by the corporation and we participate in the growth of all underlying businesses as well (such as the insurance solutions).

**Brookfield Asset Management (10.72%)**

Brookfield Asset Management has recently spinoff from Brookfield Corporation and is therefore a rather new company.  The manager earnings are based on the fees they receive on their invested capital as well as their portion fees of the investment profits (carried interest). The manager has grown their fee bearing capital from $141 billion in 2018 towards $407 billion in 2022 and AUM has grown by 19% YoY, or $66 billion. Their fee-related earnings have therefore also grown from $823 million in 2018 towards $2 billion in 2022 and have grown 21% YoY, or $352 million. 83% of their fee-bearing capital is long-dated or perpetual. Currently the manager is expected to pay a quarterly (annual) dividend of $0.32 ($1.28) which amounts to a dividend yield of 4.5%. Management furthermore expects their earnings to double in 2027 and to pay 90% of their earnings as a dividend. This means that in 5 years‚Äô time at the current market price the dividend yield would be 9% as well as their earnings to double. Furthermore, the asset manager is able to buy investments at cheap prices and can demand bargain deals for private equity deals. Please notice that the corporation holds 75% of the shares of the manager and therefore receives a $1.37 billion dividend in 2022 alone, or 2.66% of their market cap of $51 billion (the corporation). We own the asset manager because we want to profit from our stake in a highly growing business that has successfully shown in the past that they are able to even outperform their own estimations.

**Ovintiv (9.40%)**

Ovintiv Inc. is a Canadian energy company that is engaged in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. The company is focused on unconventional oil and natural gas resources, including shale, tight oil, and tight gas. Ovintiv is one of the largest oil and natural gas producers in Canada and is also active in the Permian Basin in the United States. The company certainly looks undervalued with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 3.19, a free cash flow yield of 14.5% and return on equity of 71.25%. The company has focused on paying down debt and returning capital to shareholders. They have decreased their net debt from $4.6 billion to $3.6 billion in 2022 and have the approval to buyback 25 million shares (or 10% of their shares outstanding). Investors might stay away from oil companies because of the fear of a recession and the accompanying drop in oil prices, but even when oil prices drop to crude at $65, the company guides to free cash flow generation of $11B over the next 5 years. In other words, there‚Äôs a good shot the company will return nearly its entire market cap to shareholders over the next 5 years.

**Qurate Retail Group (8.08%)**

Qurate Retail Group is a multinational company that owns and operates several retail brands, including QVC, HSN, Zulily, and Ballard Designs. The company is known for its focus on home shopping and e-commerce and Qurate Retail Group's brands offer a wide range of products, including apparel, home goods, beauty products, and electronics. YTD the stock dropped 78.89% towards a market cap of $652 million with a 10-year average of $1 billion free cash flow. Several negative issues such as a fire in a distribution facility, decreasing revenue, a high annual loss and recession fears have pushed the expectation of future profitability towards new low levels. The company, however, is paying down debt at an increasing rate and could buyback their debt on a discount due to rising interest rates. Furthermore, if the company can even come close to their average of $1 billion free cash flow, they can buyback their stock and retire nearly their entire market cap in one year. Since the stock has decreased significantly, it now offers a high margin of safety and a high upside opportunity. The company is currently valued at bankruptcy levels. If the company is able to only use a $100 million of free cash flow to buy back their own stock, they can retire 15% of their outstanding shares. Qurate Retail could be one of those rare turnaround opportunities that provide limited further downside risk and substantial potential upside returns.

**Geo Group (7.09%)**

The GEO Group, Inc. is an American multinational corporation that provides government-outsourced services, primarily in the field of corrections, detention, and mental health treatment. The company was founded in 1984 and is headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida. The GEO Group operates detention centers, prisons, and mental health facilities in the United States, Australia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. The company contracts with various government agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and state and local governments. Due to the government contracts that have a retention rate of 91%, the revenues and cash flows are highly constant and predictable. The company is furthermore paying of their debt and has a highly growing electronic monitoring business unit that has grown by 74% in the past year. The Geo Group is a real estate owner that records all their PPE at ‚Äòat cost basis‚Äô and therefore highly understates their balance sheet assets which consists for 50% of buildings. The company is growing their revenue and margins and has access to 82.000 correction beds across 102 facilities; The beds are currently valued as if the facilities are idle but the beds have an occupation rate of 85%. The Geo Group seems the perfect value play for the coming year since there is little downside risk of serious losses and there are several positive catalysts coming together.

**Diamondback Energy (6.62%)**

Diamondback Energy, Inc. is a publicly traded American oil and natural gas exploration and production company. It is headquartered in Midland, Texas and is focused on the acquisition, development, and exploration of unconventional oil and natural gas resources in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The company was founded in 2007 and went public in 2012. Diamondback Energy is one of the largest independent oil and natural gas producers in the Permian Basin and is known for its focus on using advanced technology and data analytics to optimize its operations. With a dividend yield of 6.56%, an EV/EBITDA ratio of 4.19 and a free cash flow yield of 13% the company seems highly undervalued. The general investment thesis surrounding oil companies is comparable to that of Ovintiv but Diamondback Energy carries less debt than Ovintiv, adds geographic diversification of revenues and is focused on improving free cash flows by performing strategic acquisitions. The acquisitions can be highly rewardable due to the low values of the industry assets and businesses. As long as oil prices remain elevated, so also the share price of Diamondback Energy.

**Activision Blizzard (5.86%)**

Microsoft has offered to buy Activision Blizzard for $95 per share in a transaction that is expected to complete in June 2023. With the current share price of $76 this amounts to a potential 25% return in 6 months. Although we believe that the deal will go through there is always uncertainty with arbitrage opportunities and we therefore have allocated only 5% of our portfolio towards this arbitrage play. We furthermore believe the downside risk to be minimal which contributes to the investment thesis.

**Warner Bros. Discovery (5.11%)**

Warner Bros. is down from a share price of $31 towards a current share price of $9.40, or a 70% decrease in price YTD. The company is struggling with the recent merger between Warner Bros. and Discovery and incurs high merger costs as well as depreciation and amortization that have been a downward pressure on its profitability. Investors are worried about the seemingly high amount of $47 billion debt. The company, however, has shown strong cash flows and is able to pay off their debt on a discount due to recent rising interest rates. For example, in the past two quarters the company paid off $6 billion of their debt with their cash flows. The CEO has great experience in the media industry and with turning around a media company. Although there are several problems within Warner Bros. Discovery, we believe the pessimism to be overstated and we expect a turnaround when the company can control their merger costs and regain profitability.

**F&amp;G Annuities &amp; Life (4.79%)**

F&amp;G is a nationwide market leader for insurance solutions to retail annuity and life customers and institutional clients. The company has recently spinoff from parent company Fidelity National Financial and currently has a market cap of $380 million and a 4% dividend yield. They have grown their assets under management by 21% YoY towards $42 billion (which were $28.6 billion in 2020). The U.S. retirement and middle markets are growing, and F&amp;G is well-positioned for continued growth in their retail and institutional channels. F&amp;G has diverse product lines and have grown revenue with significant above industry growth numbers (sales grown 15% YoY). Recently, F&amp;G reached an inflection point where they expect to start distributing a portion of their adjusted net earnings to shareholders over time, subject to F&amp;G board of directors‚Äô approval. YTD Q3 their net income was $581 million and their adjusted net earnings were $207 million. For the past 9 quarters, they managed to earn $100 million adjusted net earnings. Given the fact that F&amp;G has grown by double digits in the past years and recently diversified into new revenue streams and has a market cap of only $380 million we highly think that the stock is undervalued.

**Stellantis NV (4.23%)**

Stellantis is the parent company of various auto brands such as Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citro√´n, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia and Maserati. As the stock is not listed in the USA, the company only reports semiannually. The stock has dropped 35% from their high in 2022 due to recession fears and the broader market decline. Although the recession fear may be correct, it seems that Stellantis is punished before it has even committed a crime. With $50 billion in cash holdings and a market cap of $45 billion, the stock holds more cash per share than the current market price. The company has furthermore fully accelerated their EV strategy and has a broad diversified group of global customers. In the short term their earnings may of course deteriorate due to a recession but with an EV/EBITDA of 0.97 and cash flow yield of 48% it looks like the company is currently priced for a potential bankruptcy instead of a recession.

**Hewlett Packard (3.66%)**

Hewlett Packard (HP) is a technology company that offers a range of products and services, including personal computers, printers, software, and hardware. The company was founded in 1939 and has become a global leader in the technology industry. In recent years, the company has faced challenges as the technology industry has evolved and has undergone several major restructuring efforts to adapt to changing market conditions. HP has a strong free cash flow yield of 14% and has returned significant capital to shareholders. The company has returned $4 billion towards shareholders by share buybacks in 2022 and have thereby elevating earnings per share by 33% since 2018. The company furthermore carries a 3.88% dividend yield and has a highly shareholder friendly management that can run the business. HP has furthermore invested into more diverse revenue streams such as their recent acquisition of Poly. Approximately 75% of office workers are investing to improve their home setups. Traditional office spaces are also being reconfigured to support hybrid work and collaboration, with a focus on meeting room solutions. Currently, there are more than 90 million rooms, of which less than 10% have video capability. As a result, the office meeting room solutions segment is expected to triple by 2024 and HP is certain to profit from this transition.

**Paramount Global (2.41%)**

Paramount Global shares have dropped by 45.76% YTD. The company‚Äôs depressed value is due to a highly negative light on the global media outlook and DTC (direct to consumer) businesses. At a PE ratio of 3.85 and a dividend yield of 5.72%, we have time to wait out the storm surrounding media companies. The company is now priced to cheap to ignore any longer. Their streaming service Paramount+,  global revenue grew 95% YoY and they have added 4.6 million subscribers in the past quarter alone. They will launch Paramount+ in France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland in Q4 adding further to their subscriber amount and Paramount+ growing revenue. Total DTC revenue grew 38% YoY. In their theatrical unit: Top Gun: Maverick became the #1 best-selling digital sell-through title in the U.S. in its first week of release. The company continued to execute their differentiated strategy with strong IP assets (some of the studio's most famous iconic films include Titanic, Forrest Gump, The Godfather, Indiana Jones, and Mission: Impossible) which they can all use for generating additional revenue. The company furthermore continues to pay down debt aggressively. In businesses, it can take some time before the growth strategy eventually shows up in the company‚Äôs financials, reaching consumers and building various new revenue streams but this brings opportunities towards early observant investors.

2691,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**: Impressive surge in the final hour of trading to almost close the gap-fill from this morning's open; my guess is short covering.  Even with that spike, I will sum up today as a 'pause day' -- both in terms of the majors digesting yesterday's bounce + trading at 50% average volume due to holidays.  Since the action occurred inside yesterday's candles, no sense in posting new charts -- and -- all the same levels from yesterday still apply.

https://preview.redd.it/k7i82sjmn39a1.jpg?width=2318&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6311de1d8f52bf2a34e4a47b149a8718f5d4ac7e

**SPY**: 10x days into this bear flag &amp; trading occurred entirely within yesterday's green candle.  If price continues higher , nearest resistance is 387.41 top of the flag, followed closely by what could be major resistance at 389.63 gap fill which is also where the 20, 50, and 100 DMAs are converging. A secondary major resistance level is at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel. If price turns back around, nearest support remains the bottom of the flag at 374.77 -- with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low. 

&amp;#x200B;

**QQQ:** If you use December 13th to 28th as the pole, then today's candle could make for the 2nd day of what could beome a bear flag pattern.  Price traded almost entirely inside yesterday's candle. If price continues higher, nearest resistance is 270.70 the ascending TL which officially became a resistance level after yesterday's close. If price can get through that level, there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st. Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL. If price turns back around, nearest support remains 259.08 the previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th. 

&amp;#x200B;

**IWM:** 10x days into this bear flag &amp; trading occurred entirely within yesterday's green candle. If price continutes higher, nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's high. Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL. If price turns right back around, 170.67 the flag's bottom is back to being a support level, followed by 169.11 the pre-COVID high. Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows.

&amp;#x200B;

I executed 1x trade today:

**Trade**: ENTER  
**Type**: LONG  
**Stock**: DIS  
**Price**: 85.92  
**Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**: Price is down almost 60% from its March 2021 ATHs, 45% from the start of 2022, and now coming into an area with a lot of technical support: COVID candle lows between 85.84 and 81.09 -- as well as a descending TL from June 2022.  I missed my desired entry 2x days ago because it did not hit $84 even (it hit 84.07...of course).  When I saw yesterday's pop, I thought the bounce was in; today's retrace gave me a chance to enter at a level which is admittedly bordering on 'chasing' (hence the 0.5% position size).  I will bring this to a 1.5% position if price hits 79.07 the COVID-low double bottom.  My first target is $95 which is based on a descending TL (not charted below, sorry) connecting its pivot highs from November 2021 to 2022.

Volume profile is an indicator that shows you volume by price instead of volume by time. Volume by price is more significant because it shows you which price the most people are buying and selling the stock

How do you read it?  
The price of a stock tends to gravitate towards areas of value, which are found by searching for High Value Nodes (HVNs).   Additionally, Low Value Nodes (LVNs) are a sign that if the stock breaks into them, it will move quickly to the next HVN.  

The volume profile is excellent for determining supply and demand zones. Since we know which price levels have the most volume, we can assume that this is where most traders' cost basis is.¬†

However, we do not know whether there are more people short or long at that price level.

*****
&gt; Stock futures edged lower in premarket trading Friday as investors braced for the final trading day of the worst year for stocks since 2008.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 130 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures traded lower by 0.6% and nearly 0.9%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The overnight moves followed a rally Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 climbing about 2.6% and roughly 1.8%, respectively. The Dow jumped 345 points, or 1.05%.
*****
&gt; For the week, the Dow and S&amp;P are slightly higher, with the Nasdaq on track for a modest loss. All major averages are lower for December and are poised to snap a two-month win streak.
*****
&gt; Friday marks the final day of trading of what‚Äôs been a painful year for stocks. A volatile bear market, sticky inflation, and aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve battered growth and technology stocks. These factors also weighed on investor sentiment.
*****
&gt; All three of the major averages are marching toward their worst year since 2008, slated to snap a three-year win streak. The Dow fared the best of the indexes in 2022, down 8.58%, while the S&amp;P and tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 19.24% and 33.03%, respectively.
*****
&gt; As the calendar year turns the corner, some investors think the pain is far from over, and expect the bear market to persist until a recession hits or the Fed pivots. Some also project stocks will hit new lows.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sort of stuck in neutral right now, because there are more unanswered questions than there are known entities. ... We‚Äôve got a lot riding on this coming earnings season, when we think about the pressures that are going to exist on margins,‚Äù Rebecca Felton, senior market strategist at Riverfront Investment Group, said on ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThere are a lot of questions as we head into the new year, but we certainly will be happy to see 2022 go over,‚Äù Felton added.
*****
&gt; Despite the yearly losses, the Dow is on pace for a 15.65% quarterly gain and is primed to snap a three-quarter losing streak. It‚Äôs also headed for its best quarter since the second quarter of 2020. The S&amp;P is up 7.35% and slated to break three consecutive quarterly losses. The Nasdaq‚Äôs slipped 0.92%, for its fourth consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2001.
*****
&gt; All major S&amp;P sectors finished Thursday with gains, led to the upside by communication services. For the quarter, consumer discretionary and communication services are the only sectors headed for losses. Energy is the only sector on pace for yearly gains after surging nearly 58%.
*****
&gt; Communication services stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are down more than 40% on the year and consumer discretionary has fallen 37.4%, while energy, the large-cap index‚Äôs only positive sector, has soared nearly 58%.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, Chicago PMI data for December is due out Friday. Next week will see a slightly more active slate for economic data, highlighted by the nonfarm payrolls report set for Jan. 6. Financial markets are closed Monday in observance of the New Year‚Äôs Day holiday.

2726,StockMarket,"Mullen has had so much incredible news recently, they've hired ex-Tesla staff and have built an infrastructure across the USA to kick start major production of EV's that the average American working family can afford. They've also introduced an affordable micro EV this week - a perfect $15,000 product with warranty and charger for busy mega cities of Europe and are also aiming for US Military contracts with Bollinger Motors - As you can tell, I really like this stock.

**YESTERDAY** **was the biggest news I've seen so far**, the cost to borrow shares to short sell went up from 9% to a whopping 313% (source below). Instantly we saw the stock spiked +20% because of this. But the short-share float of MULN is a giant 49% and this has to be bought back now because funds cannot afford to hold it!!! anything over 20% interest generally won't be held by funds (LET ALONE 313%)

The stock price of Mullen has been manipulated and driven down for so long by short sellers and Hindenburg research, C'mon the stock is 49% shorted... this is what Hedge funds used to collectively do to try and bankrupt companies - just like Toys'r'us.

It would be incredible to see how this plays out and I really believe the 49% short position HAS to be covered and bought back over the next few weeks unless the cost to borrow returns below 20%. I really believe this stock should already be $3+ already. I've bought massive positions around and I'm not selling until at least $3, anything under $0.50 is a bargain in me eyes. I hope everyone can see how incredible this opportunity is and I personally would also love to see a new American founded technology company with dreams as big as Mullen beat the Hedge funds that are trying to bankrupt them and have the short squeeze of a lifetime that I truly believe is coming. take care all, I really wish everyone could succeed from and get the reward we deserve.

**SPY**: 9x days into this bear flag, as today's reversal remained well within the flag.  If price continues higher tomorrow, nearest resistance is 387.41 top of the flag, followed closely by what could be major resistance at 389.63 gap fill which is also where the 20, 50, and 100 DMAs are converging.  A secondary major resistance level is at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel.  If price turns back around, nearest support remains the bottom of the flag at 374.77 -- with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low.

**QQQ:** Perfect technical bounce off the 260 supprt level from the Nov 4th pivot low.  If price continues higher tomorrow, nearest resistance is 270.70 the ascending TL which officially became a resistance level after yesterday's close. If price can get through that level, there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st. Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.  If price turns back around, nearest support remains 259.08 the previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.

**IWM:** 9x days into this bear flag, but of note, a daily close back inside the flag...which negates the potential 'breakdown' from yesterday's close below &amp; restarts the 'look out.' If price continutes higher, nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's high. Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL.  If price turns right back around, 170.67 the flag's bottom is back to being a support level, followed by 169.11 the pre-COVID high.  Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows.

I sold the entire position for a loss at a price of $5.20

Well, the price started tanking and I was like ""oh man this is so easy,"" and then right after I did it I had a thought. ""how does this affect my taxes?"" Then I realized the rule. I basically tax loss harvested.

Now, I know what went down. I kept increasing my position. I was buying in the $4 range and my purchase price was still around $6+ to account for the wash sale value. I've just been averaging down and now I'm sitting at a basis of $6.20. Technically if I wanted to hold the stock long-term, then I wouldn't mind. However, some new information came out that makes me want to deleverage my position. 

So now, my question is. If I sold, let's say half or even my entire position at this new loss (albeit a lesser one), will I receive a tax loss write-off on my taxes? I need this answered asap because the last day to sell is tomorrow. If the answer is no, I'll ride this into the new year.

2769,StockMarket,"2022 has been tough for me as a rookie individual investor: so many uncertainties, fluctuations, and major policy shifts. I tried to adjust my portfolio to catch up, but by the end of the year it is still down about 8%. Nevertheless, I‚Äôve been able to earn significant dividends amid portfolio adjustment to make up for those losses (about 50%=-60% offset) and learned some valuable lessons. I would like to humbly offer my thoughts on investment trends and sectors to watch out for in 2023. 

======

Macro/Policy Trends

\-Fed must slow down rate hikes to rejuvenate the economy, but they will still have to tame inflation both for economic and for political reasons (I don‚Äôt believe in Fed neutrality anyway). Projection: the rate would top in summer-autumn 2023 and it would stay there for a while till Fed officials figure out what to do. A rate slash may not come until winter of 2023 or even early 2024 (coincidentally or not, to pave the political way for the next presidential election). 

\-Russo-Ukraine war has exhausted both the Western powers and Russia, although it may have exhausted Russia more severely. The battlefront has largely been a stalemate since November, and there may not be any profound situational change until early Spring of 2023, when the weather and the terrain become suitable for large-scale actions again. Talks of peaceful resolution are circulating out there, but my projection is that neither side wants to settle quickly until the Spring 2023 actions produce a clearer view of situations. Hence, the geopolitical uncertainties of this war would linger for quite a while.  

\-China‚Äôs U-turn of COVID lockdown policy, having been brewing for a while, still comes as a major surprise at the year‚Äôs end. However, although I do not condone the China-Imminent-Collapse view, I do not expect China to regain momentum soon. All the talks about supply chain relocation and investor cautions aside, the three-year lockdown (and especially the more draconian 18-month lockdown since mid-2021) has severely depleted China‚Äôs foreign reserve, rattled its consumption power and confidence, disrupted its labor force, and exposed its crippling weakness in social welfare provision. Even if China could power through the current wave of infection, it would still need some time to reset, restart, and contemplate what type of economic relations it wants with Western powers. What‚Äôs more, Xi Jinping has literally botched every grand strategic initiative since his second term starting in 2017-18: Belt and Road, hostility towards Western powers, indigenous high-tech development, ambition to bridge the domestic wealth gap, crackdown on tech and real estate sectors, Xinjiang/Uyghurs region, Hong Kong‚Ä¶. you name it. Now, the only major opportunity for him to garner some additional legitimacy for a fourth term and maintain the current surveillance state structure would be a war to invade/‚Äù reunite‚Äù Taiwan. With the COVID lockdown gone, his anxiety might cause him to take increasingly hostile moves against Taiwan, maybe even launch a preemptive (and hasty) strike soon. All in all, I do not expect much good news out of China and would refrain from investing heavily in its reopening/rejuvenation of the economy at least until winter of 2023. 

\-Continuing the geopolitical trend, and finally as a wrap up, the major difficulty for me is to identify a geographical region exhibiting clear momentum of growth in 2023 that could inject new rigor into the world economy. Even amid the pandemic, China‚Äôs lockdown-and-keep-producing strategy allowed it to maintain decent economic growth in 2020; when China began to lose its steam in 2021, USA, Japan, and some major economic powers of South America as well as Europe began to walk out of pandemic lockdown and took over the banner for growth. But for 2023 it seems every major region in the world is grappling with their own economic difficulties and no one is ready to take the helm. Besides, the increasingly inward-looking mentality and security-based concerns might cause a new round of severance/reformulation of global economic connections. My view may be overly grim, but for me 2023 would continue to be a muddy, rough, and restructuring year. 

====== 

Sectors/Investment Options (Both Positive and Negative Views)

\-Energy/Clean Energy: With the Russo-Ukraine war still having no end in sight, global energy security continues to be an issue. Major powers will continue to spend strenuous efforts to secure only oil and gas resources, but also the pipeline carrying them. Talks about clean and alternative energy continue to thrive, but it appears the major concern is safeguarding more traditional options. I would probably maintain a 60-40 mix of traditional/fossil energy and clean/alternative energy. 

\-Healthcare/Pharmaceutical: Another major sector I will be keeping an eye on. With COVID still raging in some parts of the world, vaccination/dedicated medicines still pose some opportunities. One interesting thing I would love to track is whether China would finally give up its ‚Äúnot losing face‚Äù stance and start importing foreign COVID vaccines (they rejected foreign mRNA vaccines but have begun importing medications in small amount). Even with COVID pandemic in rear mirror, global population continues to get older, and needs for combating new viruses/difficult diseases continue to exist. This is a long-term sector I will keep investing in. 

\-Real Estate/Housing: With Fed rate hikes, house buying seem to have seceded from the 2021 frenzy. I plan to shift my focus on housing and housing-related real estates to alternative options such as warehouse and storage, tech data centers, and telecommunication infrastructures. With global travel recovering steadily, I may also look at some opportunities in hospitality real estate. 

\-Tech: the majority of my loss this year comes from trying to identify ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù stocks and catch up with market trends, only to be taught by the market to stop doing something I am just not good at. So, tuitions paid, and lessons learned. I plan to stay way for the first quarter of 2023 and only start investing in tech companies exhibiting good fundamentals later. 

\-Food and Beverage: Like energy, food supplies are also strained due to geopolitical concerns, but contrary to energy, a raw material shortage is no great news for food and beverage businesses. With this amount of ambiguity, I would be extra careful in this sector trying to identify what companies could best weather through the supply shortage. 

\-Precious Metal: Since 2018 I‚Äôve been buying both physical gold and silver and ETFs of gold and silver. They may not be the best performing hedge or alternative investment options in 2022, but they are still some of the most easily accessible for individual investors like myself, and their price hike in the past few years also make up with some of my losses this year. I will keep regularly investing a dedicated amount of cash into precious metal. 

\-Bonds/Debts: I have to say I am not knowledgeable in this sector. I do hold mixed bond ETFs (performing roughly the same as my entire portfolio), and I‚Äôve heard recommendations on investment-grade bonds and municipal bonds (munies), but I did not do much homework on them. Any suggestions are welcome. 

\-High-yield Savings Account: I put whatever emergency and surplus cash in several high-yield savings accounts, and they have been able to generate enough interests to cover at least my grocery spending every week. It‚Äôs always good to earn a few extra bucks on idle cash. Since I do not see a rate slash soon, I will keep saving into these accounts.

2773,StockMarket,"It was a brutal year for mega-cap tech stocks across the board. But 2022 was especially rough for Amazon.

Shares of the e-retailer are wrapping up their worst year since the dot-com crash. The stock has tumbled 51% in 2022, marking the biggest decline since 2000, when it plunged 80%. Only Tesla, down 68%, and Meta, off 66%, have had a worse year among the most valuable tech companies.

Amazon‚Äôs market cap has shrunk to about $834 billion from $1.7 trillion to start the year. The company fell out of the trillion-dollar club last month.

Much of Amazon‚Äôs misfortunes are tied to the economy and macro environment. Soaring inflation and rising interest rates have pushed investors away from growth and into companies with high profit margins, consistent cash flow and high dividend yields.

But Amazon investors have had other reasons to exit the stock. The company is contending with slowing sales, as predictions of a sustained post-Covid e-commerce boom didn‚Äôt pan out. At the height of the pandemic, consumers came to depend on online retailers like Amazon for goods ranging from toilet paper and face masks to patio furniture. That drove Amazon‚Äôs stock to record highs as sales soared.

As the economy reopened, consumers gradually returned to shopping in stores and spending on things like travel and restaurants, which caused Amazon‚Äôs impressive revenue growth to fade. The situation only worsened at the start of this year, as the company confronted higher costs tied to inflation, the war in Ukraine and supply chain constraints.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded founder Jeff Bezos at the helm in July 2021, admitted that the company hired too many workers and overbuilt its warehouse network as it raced to keep up with pandemic-era demand. It‚Äôs since paused or abandoned plans to open some new facilities, and its head count shrank in the second quarter.

* A multipolar world order is being created by the heads of state of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa)
* The actions of China's President Xi and Russia's President Putin will have significant impact on the future of the US dollar and liquidity in the US Treasury market
* Bretton Woods III is being formed and China is increasingly encumbering OPEC+'s oil and gas reserves
* During a recent China-GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) Summit, President Xi announced plans to work with GCC countries to establish a new paradigm of all-dimensional energy cooperation, including purchasing large quantities of crude oil and LNG from GCC countries, strengthening cooperation in the upstream sector, and utilizing the Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange platform for RMB settlement in oil and gas trade
* This cooperation will likely result in more commodity encumbrance and higher inflation rates in the West
* Inflation traders should be paranoid and aware that the market has not yet realized that cross-currency bases will be smaller and commodity bases will be greater in the emerging multipolar world order.
* China plans to purchase large quantities of oil and natural gas from GCC countries in the next 3-5 years, and to pay for these purchases in renminbi.
* China is also interested in working with GCC countries on a range of priority areas, including clean energy infrastructure, 5G and 6G projects, and smart manufacturing.
* The People's Bank of China (PBoC) has recently re-started gold purchases, and the renminbi is now convertible to gold on the Shanghai and Hong Kong Gold Exchanges.
* The PBoC, in partnership with the Bank of Thailand, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, is working on the m-CBDC Bridge project, which enables real-time, cross-border transactions using central bank digital currencies without involving the US dollar or Western correspondent banks.
* President Xi mentioned the possibility of currency swap cooperation, whereby China could lend renminbi to GCC countries in exchange for their local currency, to be used to buy goods and services.
* Russia, Iran, and Venezuela have effectively pledged their resources to the BRICS and Belt-and-Road initiatives.
* China is also seeking to court the GCC countries to join these initiatives under a ""new paradigm.""
* The ""new paradigm"" includes the creation of an international reserve currency based on a basket of currencies of BRICS and Belt-and-Road countries, known as the ""BRICS coin.""
* This ""BRICS coin"" project is being led by Sergei Glazyev, who is minister in charge of integration and macroeconomics for the Eurasian Economic Commission.
* The weight of each participating currency in the ""BRICS coin"" will be determined by the amount of natural resources a country reserves for the backing of the new economic system.
* Bilateral swap lines with trading partner countries will provide financing for co-investments and trade financing.
* The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has granted dialogue partner status to Saudi Arabia and Qatar and has started procedures to admit Iran as a member.
* Improved relations among Russia, Iran, China, and Saudi Arabia could lead to increased momentum for the Belt and Road Initiative, BRICS+, and ""BRICS coin.""
* The Belt and Road Initiative and BRICS+ will likely require the Middle East to be a ""garden of civilizations,"" with improved relations and cooperation among the participating countries.

# War and Commodity Encumbrance

War encumbers commodities.

A recurring theme in my dispatches this year has been that in a moment when the world is going from unipolar to multipolar, the actions of heads of state are far more important than the actions of central banks. That is because heads of state lead, their actions affect inflation, and central banks merely follow by hiking rates to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù. Central banks will be behind the curve in this game, and if investors read only the speeches of central bankers but not statesmen, they will be even more behind the curve. The multipolar world order is being built not by G7 heads of state but by the ‚ÄúG7 of the East‚Äù (the BRICS heads of state), which is a G5 really but because of ‚ÄúBRICSpansion‚Äù, I took the liberty to round up.

The special relationship between China and Russia has a financial agenda to it, and what President Xi and President Putin say about the future of money ‚Äì that is, the future they envision ‚Äì matters for the future of the U.S. dollar and liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market. Their actions are forging something new: Bretton Woods III is slowly taking shape, and in light of developments to date, my motto for Bretton Woods III ‚Äì ‚Äúour commodity, your problem‚Äù ‚Äì remains apt.

President Xi‚Äôs visit with Saudi and GCC leaders marks the birth of the petroyuan and a leap in China‚Äôs growing encumbrance of OPEC+‚Äôs oil and gas reserves: with the China-GCC Summit, China can claim to have built a ‚Äúspecial relationship‚Äù not only with the ‚Äú+‚Äù sign in OPEC+ (Russia), but with Iran and all of OPEC+‚Ä¶

President Xi‚Äôs visit was the very first China-Arab States Summit in history, and echoes FDR‚Äôs meeting with King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud on Valentine‚Äôs Day 1945 aboard an American cruiser, the USS Quincy. Fixed income investors should care ‚Äì not just because the invoicing of oil in renminbi will hurt the dollar‚Äôs might, but also because commodity encumbrance means more inflation for the West.

Here are the key parts from President Xi‚Äôs speech at the China-GCC Summit (all emphasis with orange underlines are mine): ‚ÄúIn the next three to five years, China is ready to work with GCC countries in the following priority areas: first, setting up a new paradigm of all-dimensional energy cooperation, where China will continue to import large quantities of crude oil on a long-term basis from GCC countries, and purchase more LNG. We will strengthen our cooperation in the upstream sector, engineering services, as well as \[downstream\] storage, transportation, and refinery. The Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange platform will be fully utilized for RMB settlement in oil and gas trade, \[‚Ä¶\] and we could start currency swap cooperation and advance the m-CBDC Bridge project‚Äù.

Let‚Äôs dissect President Xi‚Äôs comments bit by bit, and color them with other pieces of information as we go along. First, what is the ‚Äúduration‚Äù of this theme?

It‚Äôs pretty short: in the words of President Xi, ‚Äúthe next three to five years‚Äù. In market terms, that means that five-year forward five-year inflation break-evens should be discounting a world in which oil and gas is invoiced not only in dollars but also renminbi, and in which some oil and gas is not available for the West at low prices (and in dollars) because they have been encumbered by the East.

But it does not appear that breakeven expectations reflect anything like that‚Ä¶

My sense is that the market is starting to realize that the world is going from unipolar to multipolar politically, but the market has yet to make the leap that in the emerging multipolar world order, cross-currency bases will be smaller, commodity bases will be greater, and inflation rates in the West will be higher‚Ä¶

Inflation traders should be paranoid, not complacent. As Andy Grove said, ‚Äúonly the paranoid survive‚Äù, but when I asked a small group of inflation traders over dinner in London this summer about how the market (they) comes up with five-year forward five-year breakevens, I did not sense any degree of paranoia in their answer: ‚Äúthere is no top-down or bottom-up work that we do to come up with our estimates; we take central banks‚Äô inflation targets as a given and the rest is liquidity‚Äù. Inflation breakevens do not seem to price any geopolitical risk.

Second, ‚Äúparadigm‚Äù in ‚Äúa new paradigm of all-dimensional energy cooperation‚Äù is a symbolic word. The meeting between FDR and King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud was a new paradigm too: the U.S.‚Äôs security guarantees for the kingdom for access to affordable oil supplies. Over time, the paradigm boiled down to this:

the U.S. imported oil and paid for it with U.S. dollars, which Saudi Arabia spent on Treasuries and arms and recycled the leftovers as deposits in U.S. banks. (In the wake of the OPEC shocks of the 1970s, that recycling of petrodollars led to the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s.) The old paradigm worked‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶until it didn‚Äôt:

the U.S. is now less reliant on oil from the Middle East owing to the shale revolution, while China is the largest importer of oil; security relations are in flux (see here); Saudi holdings of U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits are down as the kingdom went from funding the U.S. government and banks to owning equity in firms; and the Saudi crown prince said recently that the kingdom could reduce its investments in the U.S. (see here). Similar patterns hold in other GCC countries.

&amp;#x200B;

The ‚Äúnew paradigm‚Äù between China, Saudi Arabia, and GCC countries is fundamentally different from the one struck aboard USS Quincy. Naturally so, as China is now dealing with a rich Middle East, whereas FDR was dealing with a Middle East that had just started to develop. With wealth, power and priorities shift:

back then, ‚Äúliquidity and security‚Äù were more important for an emerging region; today, ‚Äúequity and respect‚Äù are more important for what has become an eminent region.

That is what China offered: ‚Äúall-dimensional energy cooperation‚Äù means not just taking oil for cash and arms but investing in the region in the ‚Äúdownstream sector‚Äù and leveraging the regional know-how for cooperation in the ‚Äúupstream sector‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äúupstream‚Äù could potentially mean the joint exploration of oil in the South China Sea.

Furthermore, Xi‚Äôs ‚Äúall-dimensional energy cooperation‚Äù also means working in cooperation on the ‚Äúlocalized production of new energy equipment‚Äù (see here).

Put differently, ‚Äúoil for development‚Äù (plants and jobs) crowded out ‚Äúoil for arms‚Äù ‚Äì the Belt and Road Initiative met Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Vision 2030 in a big win-win‚Ä¶

Third, the ‚Äúnew paradigm‚Äù will not be funded with U.S. dollars:

President Xi noted that ‚Äúthe Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange \[‚Ä¶\] will be fully utilized for RMB settlement in oil and gas trade‚Äù. President Xi‚Äôs comments that ‚ÄúChina will continue to import large quantities of crude oil on a long-term basis from GCC countries, and purchase more LNG‚Äù underscores the gravity of the underlined quote: combined, the two basically say that China, already the largest buyer of oil and gas from GCC countries, will buy even more in the future, and wants to pay for all of it in renminbi over the next three to five years.

Again, think of the timing of this statement in a diplomatic sense: President Xi communicated his message on ‚Äúrenminbi invoicing‚Äù not during the first day of his visit ‚Äì when he met only the Saudi leadership ‚Äì but during the second day of his visit ‚Äì when he met the leadership of all the GCC countries ‚Äì to in part signal‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶GCC oil flowing East + renminbi invoicing = the dawn of the petroyuan.

Good morning!

Given the scope of priority areas in which China plans to work with GCC countries ‚Äì the sale of clean energy infrastructure, big data and cloud computing centers, 5G and 6G projects, and cooperation in smart manufacturing and space exploration as per Xi‚Äôs speech ‚Äì there will be many avenues through which GCC countries will be able to decumulate the renminbi they earn from selling oil and gas to China.

And if, perish the thought, any GCC country were to accumulate some surplus cash in ‚Äúnon-convertible‚Äù renminbi, just as President Xi‚Äôs plane was landing in Riyadh, the PBoC revealed that during 2022, it had re-started gold purchases with gusto.

Why do China‚Äôs gold purchases matter in the context of renminbi settlement?

Because at the 2018 BRICS Summit, China launched a renminbi-denominated oil futures contract on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange, and since 2016 and 2017, the renminbi has been convertible to gold on the Shanghai and Hong Kong Gold Exchanges, respectively. Not a bad deal, this renminbi‚Ä¶

Paraphrasing Forrest Gump, ‚Äúyou can spend it on solar panels, wind turbines, data centers, telecommunications equipment, or space projects to create jobs, or you can just recycle it at some bank or just convert it to good old gold bars. Money is as money does, and convertibility to gold beats convertibility to dollars‚Äù.

President Xi‚Äôs ‚Äúthree- to five-year horizon‚Äù means that by 2025, the GCC may be paid in renminbi for all of the oil and gas that they will be shipping east to China.

Fourth, ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù references in Xi‚Äôs speech add further gravity to the above‚Ä¶

When was the last time you heard a head of state talk about swap lines and central bank digital currencies (CBDC)? And not just any CBDC, but a specific one:

*‚Äúthe m-CBDC Bridge project‚Äù*

The m-CBDC Bridge project, or as the BIS likes to refer to it, Project mBridge, is a masterclass in plumbing: undertaken by the PBoC, the Bank of Thailand, the HKMA, and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, the project enables real-time, peer-to-peer, cross-border, and foreign exchange transactions using CBDCs, and does so without involving the U.S. dollar or the network of Western correspondent banks that the U.S. dollar system runs on. Pretty interesting, no?

In a very Uncle Sam-like fashion (see here), China wants more of the GCC‚Äôs oil, wants to pay for it with renminbi, and wants the GCC to accept e-renminbi on the m-CBDC Bridge platform, so don‚Äôt hesitate ‚Äì join the mBridge fast train‚Ä¶

And finally, President Xi‚Äôs reference to starting ‚Äúcurrency swap cooperation‚Äù, reminded me of using swap lines as analogues of the Lend-Lease agreement whereby the U.S. lent dollars to Britain to buy arms to fight Germany during WWII:

now we fight climate change and if you don‚Äôt earn renminbi to build NEOM, no problem at all, we can swap your local currency for my local currency whereby I lend you some renminbi and then you can buy the stuff you need, and when you will start selling me oil for renminbi, you can pay off the swap lines. All I care about is that you don‚Äôt pay for imports from me in U.S. dollars, because I have enough U.S. dollars already and I don‚Äôt want to add to my sanctions risk.

The ‚Äúm-CBDC Bridge project‚Äù offers further leads down the monetary rabbit hole: I didn‚Äôt understand ‚Äúwhy‚Äù when I first read about Russia requesting oil payments from India in United Arab Emirates dirhams, but now I do: dirhams ‚Äúappeal‚Äù to Russia because the Central Bank of the UAE is a member of m-CBDC Bridge, and so dirhams can be sold for renminbi using central bank digital currencies and thus away from the Western banking system. This does not necessarily have to go through the m-CBDC Bridge project per se, but the existence of it implies that some CBDCs are already interlinked to facilitate interstate payments ‚Äúoff the Western system‚Äù. Then, perhaps inspired by Russia‚Äôs payment request, on December 6th, Bloomberg ran a story about India and the UAE working on a rupee-dirham payment mechanism to bypass the U.S. dollar in bilateral trade, a mechanism that will include payments for oil and gas purchases from the UAE.

Do take a step back and consider‚Ä¶ that since the beginning of this year, 2022, Russia has been selling oil to China for renminbi, and to India for UAE dirhams; India and the UAE are working on settling oil and gas trades in dirhams by 2023; and China is asking the GCC to ‚Äúfully‚Äù utilize Shanghai‚Äôs exchanges to settle all oil and gas sales to China in renminbi by 2025. That‚Äôs dusk for the petrodollar‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and dawn for the petroyuan. Now on to the topic of commodity encumbrance.

In money and banking, the word ‚Äúencumbrance‚Äù is typically used in the context of transactions involving collateral: if collateral is pledged to a specific trade, it‚Äôs referred to as ‚Äúencumbered‚Äù, which means it can‚Äôt be used to do other trades. If encumbrance becomes extreme, collateral gets scarce, which typically shows up as interest rates on scarce pieces of collateral trading deeply below OIS rates‚Ä¶

Under Bretton Woods III, a system in which commodities are collateral, encumbrance means that commodities can get scarce in certain parts of the world ‚Äì and that scarcity shows up as inflation ‚Äúprinting‚Äù far above inflation targets‚Ä¶

To see what encumbrance means in the context of the oil and gas markets today, let‚Äôs start with the geographic scope of OPEC+, that is, OPEC plus Russia: the original founding members of OPEC were the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Venezuela in 1960, which were later joined by Qatar (1961), Indonesia (1962), Libya (1962), the United Arab Emirates (1967), Algeria (1969), Nigeria (1971), Ecuador (1973), Gabon (1975), Angola (2007), Equatorial Guinea (2017), and Congo (2018). Russia joined OPEC in 2016 ‚Äì a union that forged OPEC+. Think of OPEC+ as follows: Russia, Iran, the GCC, Latin American producers, North African producers, West African producers, and Indonesia. I left out Iraq, where ISIS is complicating the overall picture, but the rest of the groupings show how China is starting to dominate OPEC+:

First, Russia and China have their famous special relationship, and since the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine, China has been paying for Russian oil in renminbi at a steep discount. As President Putin remarked, ‚ÄúChina drives a hard bargain‚Äù.

Second, Iran and China have also had a special relationship since March 27, 2021 ‚Äì the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership ‚Äì a 25-year ‚Äúdeal‚Äù under which China committed to invest $400 billion into Iran‚Äôs economy in exchange for a steady supply of Iranian oil at a steep discount. The deal included $280 billion toward developing downstream petrochemical sectors (refining and plastics) and $120 billion toward Iran‚Äôs transportation and manufacturing infrastructure. Specifically, under the agreement, ‚ÄúChina will be able to buy any and all Iranian oil, gas, and petrochemical products at a minimum guaranteed discount of 12 percent to the six-month rolling mean price of comparable benchmark products, plus another 6 to 8 percent on top for risk-adjusted compensation‚Äù (see here). This means that Iran is selling its oil to China at about the same price as Russia, or maybe in reverse, as the Iran deal predates the post-Ukraine prices for Russia!

Third, Venezuela has been accepting payments for oil in renminbi since 2019 (see here) and has also been selling oil to China at steep discounts (see here).

Fourth, Xi‚Äôs GCC ‚Äúpitch‚Äù was similar to the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Iran ‚Äì investments in downstream petrochemical projects, manufacturing, and infrastructure ‚Äì plus some higher value-added projects for Saudi Arabia to aid Riyadh‚Äôs Silicon Valley aspirations. Because the GCC aren‚Äôt sanctioned, China didn‚Äôt ask for any steep discounts, but it did ask for renminbi settlement.

Let‚Äôs stop here for a moment. Russia, Iran, and Venezuela account for about 40 percent of the world‚Äôs proven oil reserves, and each of them are currently selling oil to China for renminbi at a steep discount. The GCC countries account for 40 percent of proven oil reserves as well ‚Äì Saudi Arabia has a half of that, and the other GCC countries the other half ‚Äì and are being courted by China to accept renminbi for their oil in exchange for transformative investments ‚Äì the ‚Äúnew paradigm‚Äù we discussed above. To underscore, the U.S. has sanctioned half of OPEC with 40 percent of the world‚Äôs oil reserves and lost them to China, while China is courting the other half of OPEC with an offer that‚Äôs hard to refuse‚Ä¶

The remaining 20 percent of proven oil reserves are in North and West Africa and Indonesia. Geopolitically, North Africa is dominated by Russia at present (see here), West Africa by China, and Indonesia has its own agenda (see below).

Commodity encumbrance here means that over the next ‚Äúthree to five years‚Äù, China will not only pay for more oil in renminbi (crowding out the U.S. dollar), but new investments in downstream petrochemical industries in Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the GCC more broadly mean that in the future, much more value-added will be captured locally at the expense of industries in the West. Think of this as a ‚Äúfarm-to-table‚Äù model: I used to sell my chicken and vegetables to you, and you sold soup for a markup in your five-star restaurant, but from now on, I‚Äôll make the soup myself and you‚Äôll get to import it in a can ‚Äì my oil, my jobs, your spend, ‚Äúour commodity, your problem. ‚ÄúOur commodity, our emancipation‚Äù.

Commodity encumbrance has had its first major casualty in Europe already: BASF‚Äôs decision to permanently downsize its operations at its main plant in Ludwigshafen and instead shift its chemical operations to China was motivated by the fact that China is securing energy at discounts, not markups like Europe.

Collateral encumbrance means encumbrance from the perspective of someone pledging collateral to a dealer. Dealers in turn rehypothecate pledged collateral.

Commodity rehypothecation will work the same way: heavily discounted oil and locally produced chemicals invoiced in renminbi mean encumbrance by the East, and the marginal re-export of oil and chemicals also for renminbi to the West means commodity rehypothecation for a profit, i.e., an ‚ÄúEast-to-West‚Äù spread‚Ä¶

We are starting to see examples of commodity rehypothecation already:

China became a big exporter of Russian LNG to Europe, and India a big exporter of Russian oil and refined products such as diesel to Europe.

We should expect more ""rehypothecation"" in the future across more products and invoiced not just in euros and dollars, but also renminbi, dirhams, and rupees.

But commodity encumbrance has a darker, ""institutional"" aspect to it too...

What I described above is a *de facto* state of affairs, in which Russia, Iran, and Venezuela have effectively pledged their resources to the BRICS and Belt-and-Road ""cause"", and China is courting the GCC to do the same under a ""*new paradigm*"".

But there is also a de jure version of the commodity encumbrance theme, and here is where a recent speech by President Putin comes in. On June 22, 2022, at the BRICS Business Forum ‚Äì a WEF-like meeting of the ‚ÄúG7 of the East‚Äù ‚Äì President Putin noted that ‚Äúthe creation of an international reserve currency based on a basket of currencies of our countries is being worked on‚Äù (see here).

This ‚Äúreserve currency project‚Äù took off after China failed to reform the SDR, and its antecedents were chronicled in a recent book by Zoe Liu and Mihaela Papa: Can the BRICS De-Dollarize the Global Financial System (see here). The book was funded by the Rising Power Alliances Project at the Fletcher School of Tufts University, which in turn was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense.

It would seem to me that if the DoD has a keen interest in the topic of de-dollarization, market participants should have one as well, and should also add commodity encumbrance to the list. Now back to Putin‚Äôs ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù idea‚Ä¶

When a G7 rates strategist or trader starts looking at the ‚ÄúG7 of the East‚Äù, he or she will realize that institutions and people are different, but they do exist.

Regarding the development of an ‚Äúinternational reserve currency‚Äù √† la the SDR, Sergei Glazyev has been in charge. Since 2019, Glazyev has been serving as minister in charge of integration and macroeconomics of the EEC, that is, the Eurasian Economic Commission. He strikes me as someone similar to Liu He, who President Xi introduced to a former U.S. national security advisor saying: ‚ÄúThis is Liu He. He is very important to me‚Äù. Given his recent progress report on ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù, Sergei Glazyev seems to be very important to President Putin.

Regarding ‚Äúinstitutionalized commodity encumbrance‚Äù, the comments I could find about the ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù project from Glazyev revolve around the methodology to determine the weight of each participating currency in the ‚Äúcoin‚Äù. Specifically:

‚Äúshould \[a nation\] reserve a portion of \[its\] natural resources for the backing of the new economic system, \[its\] respective weight in the currency basket of the new monetary unit would increase accordingly, providing that nation with larger currency reserves and credit capacity. In addition, bilateral swap lines with trading partner countries would provide them with adequate financing for co-investments and trade financing‚Äù (see here). Hm. Swap lines again to facilitate trade and investments, and a de jure vision for commodity encumbrance in exchange for boosting a country‚Äôs ‚Äúcredit line‚Äù in an alternative economic system.

It seems to me that ‚Äúnew paradigms‚Äù come in pairs‚Ä¶

Attention needs to be paid to the goings-on of the global East and South, especially given that this year Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran have all started their application to the BRICS (see here). Furthermore, following this year‚Äôs Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit in Samarkand, the SCO ‚Äì ‚Äúthe NATO of the East‚Äù ‚Äì granted dialogue partner status to ‚Äúhalf the GCC‚Äù ‚Äì Saudi Arabia and Qatar ‚Äì and started procedures to admit Iran as a member‚Ä¶

In Riyadh, President Xi referred to ‚Äúa garden of civilizations‚Äù in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative (see here). Unless they involve Adam, Eve, and a snake, gardens typically refer to a happy and peaceful place. Now consider that if Russia and Iran get along, China and Iran get along, Russia and Saudi Arabia get along, and China and Saudi Arabia get along, then the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and Iran engaging in what the FT called ‚Äúfriendly talks‚Äù last week (see here) means more momentum for Belt and Road, BRICS+, and ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù.

Indeed, for the Belt and Road Initiative to work, the region has to be a peaceful ‚Äúgarden of civilizations‚Äù, and for ‚Äúthe enemy of my enemy is my friend‚Äù to work, a Great Power needs to befriend the enemy of a rival Great Power. But that strategy is increasingly hard to implement in the Middle Eastern ‚Äúregion‚Äù of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI): the great powers of the Eurasian landmass ‚Äì China and Russia ‚Äì are bound by a ‚Äúspecial relationship‚Äù, and each of them have good a relationship with each of the great powers of the Middle East, and all of them have much to gain from building a new economic and monetary system.

The China-GCC Summit is one thing, and China‚Äôs strategic partnership with Iran is another, but both Saudi Arabia and Iran applying to pillar institutions of the multipolar world order ‚Äì BRICS+ and the SCO ‚Äì at the same exact time, plus the idea of ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù as a commodity-weighted neutral reserve asset that encourages members to pledge their commodities to the BRICS ‚Äúcause‚Äù, should have G7 bond investors concerned, because these trends may keep inflation from slowing and interest rates from falling for the rest of this decade. Finally, the de facto and de jure commodity encumbrance themes described above have an even graver inflationary undertone if you consider the following:

Over the past decade, all growth in global oil production came from U.S. shale and other non-conventional sources such as Canadian tar sands. We know from official comments following President Biden‚Äôs visit to Saudi Arabia that the kingdom is currently ‚Äúpumping‚Äù at capacity and will be able to boost output by only one million barrels per day by 2025 and then ‚Äúno more‚Äù. In light of that, consider that production from shale fields has peaked and recall some recent comments from the largest shale operator in the U.S. that more drilling would harm the shale industry (see here). It appears to me that unless the U.S. nationalizes shale oil fields and starts to drill for oil itself to boost production, over the next three to five years, we‚Äôre looking at an inelastic supply of oil and gas‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and of that inelastic supply:

1. China will get a bigger share at a discount, invoiced in renminbi.
2. China will export more downstream products at a wider margin, and‚Ä¶
3. China will lure more firms like BASF with discounted energy bills.
4. Iran, with Chinese capital, will do more downstream exports too, and‚Ä¶
5. GCC countries, with Chinese capital, ditto, most likely for renminbi.

The ‚Äúnew paradigm‚Äù, as I see it, comes with a theme of ‚Äúemancipation‚Äù: both sanctioned and non-sanctioned members of OPEC, with Chinese capital, are going to adopt the ‚Äúfarm-to-table‚Äù model in which they will not just sell oil but will also refine more of it and process more of it into high value-added petrochemical products. Given supply constraints over ‚Äúthe next three to five years‚Äù, this will likely be at the expense of refiners and petrochemical firms in the West, and also growth in the West. All this means much less domestic production and more inflation as steadily price-inflating alternatives are imported from the East.

And this is not just about oil and gas‚Ä¶

Earlier this year, President Widodo of Indonesia (an OPEC member since 1962) called for an OPEC-style cartel for battery metals for EVs. Resource nationalism is in the air, but markets don‚Äôt seem to price it as a potential driver of inflation.

Consider that shortly after President Widodo floated his idea on October 30, 2022, on November 15, 2022, the G7 gave Indonesia $20 billion to move away from coal (see here). Then, on December 14, 2022, the G7 gave Vietnam $15 billion too (see here) to do the same. Great Powers are spending a lot to keep commodities and friend-shoring locations in their orbit at affordable prices. One would suspect these ‚Äúoutlays‚Äù are a part of the G7‚Äôs $600 billion earmarked to counter China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative (see here). Here is the point: major amounts of money are being mobilized to cut off big, fat tail risks to inflation, and to re-emphasize‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶five-year forward five-year breakeven inflation expectations do not price geopolitical risk. I also believe that most inflation traders may not appreciate that the future path of inflation in the West is being ‚Äúbought‚Äù in $15 to $20 billion ‚Äúclips‚Äù one commodity and one region at a time ‚Äì commodity encumbrance is a real risk.

Commodity encumbrance cuts in the other direction too‚Ä¶

Consider that on November 3, 2022, Canada ordered three Chinese firms to exit lithium mining (see here). In simple terms, commodity encumbrance means‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶a total war for the control of commodities.

President Xi‚Äôs ‚Äúnext three to five years‚Äù of implementing the ‚Äúnew paradigm‚Äù and the risks of resource nationalism and ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù means this for G7 rates:

When you look at the yield curve and think about the five-year section and then the forward five-year section, by the time the forward five-year section starts, President Xi may have accomplished his ‚Äúnext three- to five-year‚Äù goal of paying for China‚Äôs oil and gas imports exclusively in renminbi and may have advanced commodity encumbrance by developing downstream petrochemical industries in the Middle East ‚Äúregion‚Äù of Belt and Road and also the rollout of ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt think five-year forward five-year rates are pricing the future correctly: breakevens appear to be blind to geopolitical risks and the likelihood of the above.

If the above scenario won‚Äôt come to pass, it will be due to a big, global fight‚Ä¶

But a fight like that takes time to conclude, and in its wake, forward five-years should still be different. Or maybe not, if yield curve control funds reconstruction, but under that scenario, bond investors will be subject to financial repression‚Ä¶

Five-year forward five-year breakeven inflation expectations now make little sense. For two generations of investors, geopolitics did not matter. This time is different: it‚Äôs time to get real and it‚Äôs time to start pricing the secular end of ‚Äúlowflation‚Äù‚Ä¶

Recognize two things: first, that inflation has been driven by non-linear shocks (a pandemic; stimulus; supply chain issues involving laptops, chips, and cars; post-pandemic labor shortages; and then the war in Ukraine), and second, that inflation forecasts treat geopolitics in the rearview mirror. Don‚Äôt be too DSGE‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶think about inflation with geopolitics, resource nationalism, and ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù in mind as the next set of non-linear shocks that will keep inflation above target, forcing central banks to hike interest rates above 5% and keep them high as they‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶‚Äúclean up‚Äù the inflation mess caused by Great Power conflict.

This year was just the beginning. Next year sets the stage for BRICS and the BRI: in April, China will host the fourth Belt and Road Forum (the WEF of the East). Following forums in 2017 and 2019, but not 2021 due to Covid, the coming forum will be hosted by a China that, while in lockdown, forged a bond with all of OPEC+.","Latest Zoltan Pozsar from CS - ""War and Commodity Encumbrance"" - Deep Dive Into Geopolitical Risk, Global Currency Networks and Commodity Markets",1672332619

Is this typically the strategy for trading crypto? I was hoping to be able to effectively day trade cryptos in my down time or whatever; I‚Äôm talking buying and selling within minutes ‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôm just wondering if I‚Äôm missing something.

Based on my study I offer the following trading strategy for beginners using the PCR OI Indicator:

* Intraday option traders should begin trading within two hours of the market opening.
* Stop loss maximums are set at 30 points (naked) and 20-25 points(spreads) per lot.
* Based on PCR (Put Call Ratio) statistics, the entry should be closed to vwap.
* Buy a call if the PCR is larger than 1.25, and a put if the PCR is less than 0.75 to close the VWAP.
* It is also critical to notice the PCR's growing and decreasing pattern.
* Option on ATM/ITM trading (Delta: 0.4 to 0.6).
* The trailing stop loss is critical.
* Profit booking rules: 30 to 40 points for each lot.
* Trade when you receive a free 25-point Trail SL
* Trade naked options on an intraday basis only.

All of the above suggestions are not fixed rules, you may agree or disagree, and all constructive suggestions are welcome",Trading strategy for beginners using the PCR OI Indicator,1672327665

Venus Power features high power, versatile adaptability, outdoor LED lighting compatibility, cell phone wireless charging, PD fast charging and solar panel charging, among others.

Therefore, this device is capable of fully adapting to the market development of current diversified electricity demand from both home use and travelling abroad.

2788,StockMarket,"Investors betting against Tesla Inc. are getting the big bonanza they have been waiting for, with the electric-vehicle maker set to record its worst annual performance on record.

Short sellers in the company ‚Äî or bearish investors who stand to gain when an asset‚Äôs price falls ‚Äî are poised to reap mark-to-market profits of about $17 billion, making Tesla the most profitable short trade of the year, data from S3 Partners shows.

Tesla has tumbled more than 42% in December alone, driving it to a loss of 68% this year ‚Äî marking a radical about face for a stock that surged during the low-rate era of the pandemic.

It‚Äôs a rare victory for the shorts, whose 89% return comes after several years of significant losses, S3‚Äôs Ihor Dusaniwsky said. About 2.9% of Tesla‚Äôs free float is held short, according to S3 data.

Tesla has faced a tumultuous year, with investors fleeing risk assets over concerns about geopolitical uncertainty, high inflation, rising interest rates and a possible recession. Add to that worries that Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk‚Äôs focus will be diverted to his recently acquired social-media company, Twitter, just as demand for electric vehicles is set to take a hit.

Dusaniwsky expects short selling to persist until the stock reaches a bottom. But analysts and investors are still struggling to see a bottom, especially as the company is due to report fourth-quarter delivery numbers early next month and has been offering large buyer incentives.

Tesla shares rose 3.5% in premarket trading on Thursday.

Even if share price begins to recover, its notorious volatility could continue to linger, according to S3‚Äôs Dusaniwsky.

‚ÄúWhen Tesla‚Äôs stock begins to tick upwards, there should be a flurry of short covering which will help boost its stock price higher and quicker as shorter-term short sellers look to realize their outsized mark-to-market profits before they evaporate,‚Äù he said.

Tesla (TSLA) short sellers and bearish investors are poised to profit of about 17 billion, making it the most profitable short trade of the year according to S3 Partners, as the EV giant is set to record its worst year ever.

2792,StockMarket,"After shares of Tesla dipped by more than 10% on Tuesday deepening a year-long selloff, CEO Elon Musk told employees not to be ‚Äútoo bothered by stock market craziness.‚Äù

Musk circulated the comments on Wednesday in a companywide email, which CNBC obtained. He told staffers that Tesla needs to ‚Äúdemonstrate continued excellent performance,‚Äù and that ‚Äúlong-term, I believe very much that Tesla will be the most valuable company on Earth!‚Äù

Electric vehicle blog Electrek reported earlier on the email.

Tesla shares have declined about 68% for the year, though they rose 3.3% on Wednesday to $112.71. The stock is down 42% in December, and is poised to close out its worst month, quarter and year on record.

Musk has blamed Tesla‚Äôs declining share price in part on rising interest rates. But critics point to his Twitter takeover as a bigger culprit for the slide, which has wiped out about $675 billion in market cap this year as of Wednesday‚Äôs close.

In the email, Musk thanked Tesla employees for their work in 2022, encouraged them to push hard for a strong fourth-quarter finish, and asked them to ‚Äúvolunteer to help deliver‚Äù cars to customers before midnight on Dec. 31, if at all possible.

During the last days of most quarters, Tesla enlists employees from all over the company to bring new cars to customers in order to hit or exceed stated delivery goals, work that in normal times is limited to people on the sales and delivery teams. The company has been aiming for 50% year-over-year growth in vehicle deliveries but has cautioned investors it may not meet that target every year.

Musk‚Äôs attention has been focused on Twitter of late. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO sold tens of billions of dollars worth of shares in his electric vehicle company in 2022 to finance the $44 billion buyout of the social media company.

Basically, I wanted to turn my 1000 to 1600 then take out the 600 which I'd use to buy a roundtrip. Well... My current valuation is at 623 euro. 

So, here is how I started...
Meta was falling apart and knowing how it will DEFINITELY swing back I invest 1000 in Meta... Day one... I see the stock prices going down I started reading all about market and projections and what not and all i can understand Meta will be dead and hence I have dumped my money in wrong stock, i saw the market close in red and thought I'll cash out the next morning. And I did. I make 20 euro profit. Now I had 1018 euro cash i could use for trading i learnt how Paypal is supposed to climb up this year and did my math and realized I'd make 1400 by the end of year, i can add 200 and get my roundtrip.

Well, the prices started coming down and I got afraid next day I cashed out and had 1004 in cash.

Now i just wanted to learn the market and see what stocks will obviously always be going up. I bought ONE stock of tesla (before the split) and held on to it for 2 days. Tesla's quarterly was about to come out and projections said I'd make 200 in profit. The report came out and nothing moved, so i sold the stock and immediately after that the Twitter shit show began, tesla stock shot upto 1040 euro per stock which would have made me a profit of 50 euro, but i was already out. 

I decided, not to do this anymore, just buy something reliable and keep it. By the end of year I'll make SOMETHING... 

I bought Nvidia, and AMD.

the last stock purchases I made. And then the market decided, not to go up even ONCE after that.

I never made my roundtrip.

Learn whatever you can from my mistakes. Teach me what you can if you can. I learnt to probably never trust the projections.

2822,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**: Another solidly down day with more bearish confirmations &amp; price action.  SPY held up the best, IWM began to show indicates of breaking down through its bear flag, and QQQ is notably overextended to the downside.

**SPY**: 8x days into this bear flag, but at least price remained well within the flag -- the ""best"" price action we saw today of the 3x majors.  Nearest support remains the bottom of the glaf at 374.77 -- with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd. Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to Octover 13th pivot low. Nearest resistance is 389.63 gap fill with major resistance at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel.

**QQQ:** 11th day down on the current move.  Since 262.46 did not hold &amp; today's candle closed below, the former support TL is now a resistance level.  Nearest support remains 259.08 the previous pivot low; because price is moving near-directly to this level, it should offer moderate support.  If not, major support remains the 254.26 double bottom from Octovber 13th.  If price turns higher, nearest resistance is mot certainly that aforementioned ascending TL.  If price manages to get through that level, there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st. Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.

**IWM:** 8x days into this bear flag, and of note, a daily close below 170.67 the flag low; a close below 170.34 will validate the breakdown tomorrow.  Next support of 169.11 the pre-COVID high will offer minimal support since the bear flag consolidated price just above the level.  Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows. If price turns higher, nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's high. Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL.

Due to the outbreak of COVID after China's recent lifting of COVID policy, Tesla faced severe labor shortage problem in its Shanghai Facility. Followed by the WSJ report on production halt, Tesla slumped another 11% on Tuesday. However, since the lack of workforce is a temporary impact, and China is quickly passing the peak stage of the pandemic, a potential rebounce might be witnessed soon.

&gt; Stock futures climbed fractionally Wednesday morning as traders look to the end of a losing year and prepare for 2023.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 91 points, or 0.27%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.25% and 0.2%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Investors will look for insights into the state of the economy in manufacturing data from the Richmond Federal Reserve and pending home sales coming Wednesday morning. Market participants will be looking for numbers that can signal the economy is cooling, which they hope could indicate to the Fed that interest rate hikes can continue slowing.
*****
&gt; Tuesday kicked off the start of a holiday-shortened trading week. The Dow rose 37.63 points, or 0.11%, to close at 33,241.56. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.40%.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite shed nearly 1.4%, driven down by an 11% drop in Tesla stock after The Wall Street Journal reported that the electric vehicle maker would continue a weeklong production pause at a Shanghai facility. Tuesday marked the seventh straight day of losses for the stock.
*****
&gt; It comes at the end of a tumultuous year for the electric-vehicle maker as owner Elon Musk executed a chaotic purchase of Twitter. Tesla‚Äôs share value is down 69% this year.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúA year ago, Musk was a hero and there was panic buying to the upside,‚Äù said Eric Jackson, founder of EMJ Capital, on ‚ÄúClosing Bell: Overtime.‚Äù ‚ÄúRight now ... it‚Äôs panic selling.‚Äù

I started investing recently and made a bit too fast decision to invest in C3.AI.

After a bit more research, the company seems a bit scammy and I don't really believe this stock turning profitable.

Some other of stocks i bought are also down, but those are companies i have much more trust in and their business model makes much more sense to me, so i don't mind.

The C3.AI is at its biggest low since 5 years and I'm at around 20% loss.

I expect it to just keep going down and my intuition tells me to sell it now and cut loss, but I'm just a beginner and would like to hear other people opinion.

From 15 minutes chart, support level is around 3800, resistance level is around 3850. Yesterday SPX failed to fill the gap, it will be more like a sideways trend in 2022 last three trading days.

2879,StockMarket,"Tesla is down like crazy recently. Yesterday TSLA was down 11.41%, marked the 7th consecutive red days, it‚Äôs probably due to the production cut of Shanghai factory in December and January.

Since the start of December, TSLA is down 45% with increased volumed after mid-December. The trading volume of Tuesday is remarkable considering the subpar trading volume of the main indices. And with that volume and that % change, TSLA is not seen any sign of slowing down in near term.

The next technical support level I found is around 91.52, which was tested and confirmed more than TWO years ago. But comparing the cars of TSLA competitors, TSLA cars are not attractive to me, they are not as competitive as it was couple years ago. If TSLA don‚Äôt come out with any new models or revise current models to be more competitive to their peers, the sales as well as the price of TSLA are going to decrease as the competition go intense. So personally, I don‚Äôt think this 91.52 support is enough to stop the downward momentum, if that support is broken, then the next support I am looking for is around 60.84.","TSLA is not going to stop, more rooms till the bottom",1672225350

2896,StockMarket,"Hello Traders, here is my analysis for why I believe TESLA (and others) had another day of large selling.

\- To start, the broader market as a whole only sold off a small percentage today, around 1% to 2% for most stocks. So why is it that Tesla once again sold off almost 12% in a single day?

\- Well to be clear, Tesla was just one of the names in a particular group of stocks that saw heavy selling today, what do these stocks all have in common? They're ""Hype Stocks."" (Meme stocks)

What are ""Hype Stocks"", they're a group of stocks that retail traders hyped up in 2020-2021 and bought in mass, pushing these stocks into having insane P/E ratios and being incredibly overvalued.

\- What stocks accompanied Tesla in today's sell off? TESLA -12%, NVDA -7%, AMC -8.5%, GAMESTOP -9% and COINBASE -8% just to name a few.

\- Being as these stocks all belong under the classification of ""Hype Stocks"" and all sold off heavily compared to the rest of the market, there's an obvious confluence between the type of investor who was selling.

\- Given this, it is a clear indication that these investors are starting to panic, which is the reason for the selling.

So now you might be wondering... why aren't investors buying at these discounted levels?

\- The reason is simple, big investors are still in the process of end of year tax loss selling, and in addition these investors do not want their clients to see that they have stocks such as TESLA in their portfolio at the moment.

The good news is, the January Effect is just around the corner

\- The January effect is where the heavily sold off stocks who endured tax loss selling, rally in January due to their being more buyers in the market than sellers.

\- So for names such as TESLA which has been incredibly beaten down and no investor wants to buy until the new year, we will likely see TESLA rally in after the new year.

To summarize...

\- Retail traders who bought these stocks off Hype in 2020-2021 are panicking and dumping their shares, while big investors do not want to buy until after the new year.

2900,StockMarket,"Some of the bagholders will not like reading this, but Elon hype is dead, it's over. I am sorry but this is it. You know how stockmarket works, once a hype is gone it's gone. Nobody will ever believe him again. Even if he goes to Mars now, or sends 100 tesla to the orbit, doesn't matter. He will be remembered as doge scammer, pump &amp; dumper, liar etc. his ego has taken over his identity and morality.

Look, majority of humans have this weakness that when large amounts of money enter their life, they lose their minds. They become arrogant, power-hungry, lose humility, their very identity and morality. They start to play mini-God and surround themselves with yes-man, and if their mini-God status ever gets challenged, they go mad and not shy away to use illegal ways that they did not use at the beginning of their story.

Just look around you. I am sure you have a couple friends who become rich from a lucky hit on stockmarket, family inheritence or through early bitcoin or some other way. I am not exaggerating, 99% of the time you will see same story happening. The guy that was your best friend years ago that you could argue any subject no longer tolerates to hear you oppose them anymore. He has more money so in his mind he is more ""successful"" so that makes him ""right"" on everything. He no longer seeks friends who tell the truth to their face, he seeks people who admires his supreme intelligence and supreme decisions.

I admired Elon Musk when he had Mars landing presentations etc. people believed he is the new kid on the block with crazy ideas for humanity's progression. I admired Bill Gates before he became the vaccine lord and started to dictate how people should live their lives. I was a Binance user for a long time and I admired CZ. CZ is no longer same person as first time Binance was launched. He has a very similar story like many others that started humble and promising, only to end up as corrupted as any other dictator.

Bottom line is that: Do not over-idolize anyone, not Warren Buffet, not Vitalik etc. anyone I mean anyone regardless of how genius or humble they seem today. Very very few people don't lose their minds when large amounts of money enter their life, and props to those who still keep their feet on the ground. But at the end everyone is just human and prone to same weaknesses. That is why history keeps repeating itself over and over again.

If by chance that you do get rich one day from this capitalism's game of stonks remember where it started and remember who was with you when you had nothing. Having some self principles and self virtues will keep your ego in check and keep your feet on the ground.",Do not over-idolize anyone...,1672195407

2908,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**:  All 3x majors continue to behave decidedly bearish.  SPY and IWM are maturing their bear flags, while QQQ continues to grind lower.  As expected, extremely light volume (even compared to last week).  The fact this light volume did not float higher shows how negative the overall market sentiment is with retail/small investors (who are likely making up the majority of this price action; institutions are largely out this week).

**SPY**: 7x days into this bear flag; price remained within Friday's candle.  Nearest support at 374.13 gap-fill which price missed on December 22nd.  Mid-support is 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd.  Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to Octover 13th pivot low.  Nearest resistance is  389.63 gap fill with major resistance at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill.  Max upside is around 403 within the current channel.

**QQQ:** Price continues to grind lower; 262.46 must hold on a daily closing basis for the former support TL to not become a resistance TL.  If that level cannot hold, then 259.08 is nearest support.  Major support is the 254.26 double bottom from Octovber 13th.  Nearest resistance is the aforementioned ascending TL, then moderate resistance at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st.  Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.

**IWM:** 7x days into this bear flag; price remained within Friday's candle.  Nearest support is 170.68 the flag's low.  Moderate support is around the 169 pre-COVID high.  Major support is 162.76 triple bottom  from June, September, and October lows.  Nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's high.  Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th.

**New Avg**: 120.99  
**New Size**: 2.5%  
**Thesis**: I added twice because price fell through &amp; to major technical levels.  My cost average is still 'in range' of reasonable targets when the bounce does come.  This situation highlights why I keep position sizes small when trading volatility -- at only 2.5% of my portfolio, I stil have plenty of capital available if price falls further.  My next add(s) will likely be $100 to $90, and will bring my position to 4-5%.  My new target is $130 to 135, but depending on how price returns to that level, $165 is not out of the question...but probabilities no longer favor that initial target.

**Trade**: ENTER  
**Type**: SHORT  
**Stock**: PEP  
**Price**: 183.36  
**Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**: From mid-November to mid-December, price saw 3x failed breakouts while trading in upper-range of channel. Most significant is December 13th: significant gap-up, failure to hold above the previous ATH, and major bearish engulfing candle.  Since December 15th, price has formed a bear flag. I entered a small 0.5% position because 1) light holiday volume should cause price to float higher naturally; but more importantly 2) the gap-up this morning above the 20 DMA.  I will add another tranche a 186.50 -- then use a upper channel  TL tag to add a 3rd tranche depending on how price moves into that level.  Depending on the overall position size, my first target to cover is the 200 DMA at $172, followed by the lower channel TL at $165.

2910,StockMarket,,Why stocks still have a long way to fall,1672175827
2911,StockMarket,"1. Buy good companies with strong financial statements.  Companies with low debt, and companies that show a trend of growing and increased net income and revenue. Once you understand how to read a financial statement, you can make 70% of your decision to buy based on the financial statement, even before knowing what the company is.
 
2. Only buy companies that has a competitive advantage, one that would be had for another company to overtake them.  A company where you can envision that 50 years from now, they will still be relevant.
 
3. Buy undervalued companies.  There are many companies out there with great financial statements, a trend of growth, but the price must be right.  For example, Amazon shows consistent growth, but at their current price and how much net income they are bringing in and P/E ratio, it will take many decades for them to make enough money to warrant that current price evaluation.
 
4. You only need a few very good companies to get rich.  People that diversify don‚Äôt know what they are doing, so they try to mitigate risk.  But to get wealthy, you go all in only a few stocks that you have thoroughly researched and meets all the criteria stated above.  People that get very rich, they do it off only a few stocks.  You want all your money in a good company where when it moves, it moves in a big way.  Enough to move the needle.
 
5. Have a strategy, once you know the top 5 companies you are going to invest in, the price fluctuation doesn‚Äôt matter as much anymore.  It will go up and down periodically, but each time it goes down, you need to buy more.  Load up as much as you can when the price is low.  You are betting on your research and confidence that 10 years from now this company will grow many folds.  It‚Äôs hard to predict in the short term whether a stock going to go up or or down, but I can predict with high certainty that a stock will go up in 10 years.  
 
6. Stock investing is simple.  If a company is profitable and consistently brings in profit, the stock will grow and so will your money.
 
7. Ignore the micro / temporary issues in society.  For example, covid, new politician, fear of war, Ukraine invasion etc.  All this does not matter, it‚Äôs only temporary. A good company that historically shown to make profits and grow, they will overcome and continue to grow the long run.
 
8. Do not invest money if you need the money in the short run.  For example you need the money in a week a month or even a year.  Stock investing is long run, most big profits are made in year 6 or higher.  You need to be able to buy and hold for 10 years to see substantial increases.
 
9. Do not invest in speculative stocks.  Don‚Äôt invest in the story, for example ‚Äúmarijuana stocks‚Äù is the future, or electric cars or renewable energy is the future.  Only invest in companies that you can check their financial statement and see they have a trend of growth.  Not saying to invest in well established companies that are profitable, but you need to find a company that you look at the financial statements and pick up a trend of growth.  NIO is an example of a good stock that has shown growth.  Although they are still not in the green on net income yet, they show a trend of increasing revenue each year, closing the gap on the net income to be profitable and each year they are producing more cars and expanding their markets.  
 
10. Remove the prejudice in your investing strategy.  Don‚Äôt be prejudice because you don‚Äôt like investing in oil, or because it‚Äôs from China you don‚Äôt like Chinese people, or you don‚Äôt like investing in companies that start with the letter A.  All that does not matter, you are here to make money.   Invest wisely by analyzing the financial statement and where the trajectory of that company is going.
 
11. Never sell a stock when it‚Äôs low.  If you invest in good companies stated above, these companies has always recovered and increase their stock price significantly after the turmoil.  
 
12. Invest in companies that has room to grow.  Think of stock investing like how many innings in a baseball game.  Ask yourself, where is this company now, is it in the 1st inning or is it in the 9th inning.  For example Amazon, ask yourself where is this company at in it‚Äôs life, is this company now fully matured, do they still have room to grow? In my opinion, Amazon is near the full maturity stage, it‚Äôs in the 7th inning, there‚Äôs not much more room for it to expand or grow.  But Alibaba, is the 2nd biggest competitor to Amazon, and it shows a great financial statement and the trajectory of it to grow is still quite high.  They are consistently getting more active user each year and the market they are in, which is China still has a lot of room to grow.
 
13. Do not options trade, it‚Äôs gambling.  It‚Äôs hard to predict a stock going up or down in the short run.  To ensure high probability of success, buy good, undervalued companies and hold long run.

# [Stock futures rise heading into the final trading week of 2022](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/26/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose on Tuesday as the final trading days of 2022 kicked off and investors hoped a Santa Claus rally will appear and lift a market that has been weighed down by recession fears.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose by 160 points, or 0.48%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively.
*****
&gt; During the regular session Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 176 points higher, or 0.5%. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Friday marked the start of the time period for a Santa Claus rally, which is typically considered the final five-day trading stretch in the current year, as well as the first two trading days in the new year. Markets were closed Monday for the Christmas holiday.
*****
&gt; Due to low trading volumes, investors are expecting either relative quiet or further volatility during the holiday-shortened week. Markets are closing out a month and year defined by a surge in recession fears.
*****
&gt; In December, the S&amp;P 500 dropped roughly 5.8%, while the Dow and Nasdaq dropped about 4% and 8.5%, respectively. These are the biggest monthly declines since September. The major averages are headed for their worst annual performance since 2008.
*****
&gt; ‚Ä≥[The] question of what kind of recession remains unanswered,‚Äù Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, wrote Friday. ‚ÄúAnd for this, the answer is dictated primarily from how much more the Fed needs to raise rates to finally tackle sticky inflation.‚Äù
*****
&gt; On the economic front, traders are expecting the latest data on November wholesale inventories and the October S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home prices Tuesday before the bell.

This small amount of coverage had little if any impact on the stock price Friday, which quickly fell 20 cents on opening but climbed steadily back to its original position. From some quick research, I‚Äôve learned that government contract awards rarely impact stock price except when the award is very large (which this contract is, and fixed-price contracts are more impactful than cost-plus contracts). This odd effect is due in part at least to insufficient efforts made to push the news to media outlets.

**TLDR**

&amp;#x200B;

* They make a ton of recommendations. Many products underperform the market
* Their annual Top 10 list did great in 2021 but not 2022, but you pay for it at $3600 per year. You can get a base subscription for $249/yr for just the stock screeners which is reasonable, though many are baked into Fidelity‚Äôs platform for free.
* Their stock screeners are great for finding stocks, especially the VGM and Zacks Rank #1 screener. But to do it right, you need to spend 5hrs a week on it seeing what‚Äôs new.

Zacks offers a couple dozen different lines of stock picking services plus a few dozen different stock screens. It‚Äôs quite overwhelming actually, but also a bit addictive to pour through them to find some good stocks. I found most of their services don‚Äôt outperform the market or have so many stocks in them it would be a full-time job to buy and manage them.

For most of the screeners, the time it takes to vet them and look at each of the 50 plus stocks in each is too much of a time commitment, but looking at the first few in the list gives some ideas of what is working.I started just looking at the recent additions to see if there were secular trends and that helped.

I tried out some of their healthcare picks with mild success: I was going to share the names but the bots on here blocked them because they are under 300M market cap. One was bought out for 40% over purchase price. One went up 6X. Two fizzled down -70%. If you want the names DM me.

I did OK using the value, growth, and momentum stock screener but I really had to spend a lot of time separating out the good ones and figuring out what was recently added, which they don‚Äôt tell you. If you get them too late, the move has already occurred and you will likely see the stock correct quickly.

A few gems I traded from their list around March of 2021 included SEM (health clinics), DAC (container shipping), BERY (financial), and MT (steel). My target was +100% for each and I made that within a year of buying for each. I bought options. HOLX was an exception. I lost -15% on that pick, though it was mostly due to the fact it soared high from COVID revenues and then sold off quickly as the vaccines rolled out. It‚Äôs since back to slightly above the purchase price.

* **Percent Up Since Rec: 20%**
* **Avg Return of Rec: -8.8%**
* **SPY Return: -10.3% as of time I drafted**

**2. LEVELFIELDS**

**TLDR**:

&amp;#x200B;

* Event-driven alerts work and I like that the success rate is visible on the website
* There are a lot of alerts you can subscribe to, so it‚Äôs best to choose one of their lower volume, higher performing strategies to avoid opportunity overload
* It‚Äôs good at finding high shorter term returns with high success rates
* For the biggest companies (AAPL, TSLA, etc), my news alerts arrived faster. For those under 100B market cap, it's very helpful.
* Price is 228/yr but their emails of a big update seem to be hinting a hike is coming soon

**Winning Percent: 79%**

**Avg Return/Trade: 23%**

I‚Äôve been using an event-driven research system called LevelFields for about a year now. It was a little rough around the edges in the early days but has gotten much better over time. It‚Äôs good at identifying news events early that drive stock prices up and down, often from direct announcements from companies. It shows stock patterns following events, which is cool, especially for the negative events so you can see how far the stock will probably fall.

They effectively filter the noise out of the news and just focus on a couple dozen event types that really shake stock prices: hedge fund investor moves, layoffs, shorts, FDA approvals, leadership changes, Amazon new product launches, and a couple dozen other types. Unlike the technical pattern alert systems out there I‚Äôve seen, it focuses on real news, which I like, as I feel pattern trading is often a lot like staring at clouds and making shapes out of them in your mind.

For the big companies everyone watches, they don‚Äôt beat news alerts. But for the bulk of the companies you‚Äôve never heard of or have forgotten about, it flags a lot of opportunities and companies on the rise.

Most of the time I trade with the information. Sometimes I use it to find stocks for longer term plays. Like Zacks, they put out a lot of opportunities so any analysis here is going to be biased by what I‚Äôm choosing to act on. But they publish the success rate and show all past alerts so the past performance is embedded in the platform under each strategy, which is nice.

The winning rates for their strategies range from a high of 90% to a low of 50%, with most in the 70% range. You can alter the outcomes by adjusting the filters for the types of stocks. I don‚Äôt like to buy commodities and microcaps generally, as the prices fluctuate too much on factors beyond the company‚Äôs control, so I filter those out.

Lately, I‚Äôve been trading on their layoffs scenario, which tracks companies firing people. If you filter for just expensive stocks that are firing people to grow earnings, you can get to 80% accuracy in price prediction. I‚Äôve noticed some events cause the share prices to pop right away, so I often wait for the first selloff before entering the trade.

**Here are the alerts I opted to act on and how they turned out**. I‚Äôm noting hold times since it‚Äôs not a buy and hold forever system though I supposed you could for some stocks.

10.21.21 - Qualcomm. Return: stock rose +50% in 1 month. Traded options for +300% gain.  
 11.11.21 - Northern Gas (NOG). Return: +45%. I held for 5 months.  
 12.9.21 - CVS. return: +60% in 1 month (options)  
 11.18.21 - BLDR. Return: +67% in 4 days (options)  
 12.04.21 Signature Bank SBNY. Return: +16% in 1 month. I then traded a couple more times on it as it was doing well until the Crypto crash. It holds a lot of staked Bitcoin.

12.6.21 Silicon Motion (SIMO). +25% in 2 months. Still like this semi and will buy back. They do memory chips and had been killing it. It was hard to find a cheap semi at one point but this one always traded at a reasonable p/e.

12.9.21 Labcorp (LH): +8% in 1 month but I held it too long and exited down -10% due to covid rates dwindling and testing volumes decreasing

12.15.21 - Broadcom (AVGO). Return: 0% Sold off when war started.  
 2.3.22 - Quest (DGX). Return: +50% in 1 month via option trade  
 2.15.22 - Upstart (UPST): Return: +30% on options in 1 week. I had owned this stock already and was trading it off and on for about a year..

2.17.22 Blocked by mod bots from showing: +50% in 2 days  
 2.24.22 - ALSN (Allison Transmission ). Return: +8% in 1 month  
 3.11.22 - Applied Materials (AMAT). Return: +4% in a week.  
 3.17.22 - Lockheed Martin (LMT): Return: +70% in 3 weeks (option trade on news Germany was buying planes)

3.17.22 - CMC Steel. Return: +10% in 1 month

3.31.22 - LGVN. Return: +20% in 1 day.  
 5.9.22 - TWTR. Return +100% on puts in 1 mo. This was the ‚ÄúElon will back out‚Äù trade a big hedge fund was betting on, so I joined them. A short would‚Äôve worked too.

5.24.22 - Digital Ocean (DOCN): Returns TBD. Up 8% on equity but I‚Äôm selling covered calls for an extra 20% annually. I really like this company. It‚Äôs like a mini AWS that is more cost effective for small businesses.

6.15.22 - Space company. +50% in two days

6.24.22 - Digital Turbine (APPS). +31% in 2 months. I think this was mostly luck given the timing of the bear market rally.

6.28.22 - Alibaba (BABA). -30% on options in 3 weeks. Can‚Äôt seem to get a break on BABA.

7.14.22 - Pinterest (PINS). +30% on hedge fund moves

7.27.22 - Mining company. return: -10% on option puts. Still puzzled why the stock is up.

7.28.22 +4% and holding. They are one of the only medicines for monkeypox.  
 8.12.22 - Peloton (PTON). +10% in a day on its layoff news

8.15.22 -3%. It makes solar cells in China and is growing revenues by triple digits.

**3. THE FOOL**

I resisted trying out the Fool for years because they wrote so many articles and ads touting their stock picks that I assumed they had to be full of it. But, when I had enough money in the account, I decided to try it out and see if they maybe could save me some time finding stocks early or if they were the cause of certain pump and dumps I was watching.

**TLDR**:

&amp;#x200B;

* They pick good, overvalued growth stocks but they don‚Äôt try to time the market at all because they want 5 year hold times, which can lead to big drawdowns while you wait
* I would‚Äôve lost a fortune had I taken much of their advice. However, if you have a decade long time horizon and can stomach 75% pullbacks, the stocks they recommend will probably come out ahead
* They repurpose recommendations from different subscription tiers, often using lower tier recs to increase the returns of higher level subscriptions
* They make a lot of recommendations. It‚Äôs time consuming to keep up.
* Big range of prices from $100/yr to $5,000/yr and they upsell a lot

They had a lot of subscription options to choose from that range from a hundred bucks or so a year to $5K per year. I signed up for a few of them, including their stock advisor, IPO one, and cloud innovators and small caps service. I should note that the lists they provide overlap enormously, so they clearly repurpose their recommendations and charge you more to get the same recs again and again.

For the cloud services recommendations, I found they generally picked out solid growth companies (DOCN, DOCU, ESTC,etc) but too late, after the stocks were already richly valued. So I traded them instead of buying them. Below are the email recommendations they sent out I saved.

I kept emails of other recommendations, though I admit this list is not complete since they only sent emails containing the rec half the time. The rest of the time they send you to their website to watch a 30-minute webinar of their picks in the middle of the work day, which was strange to me and defeated my purpose of saving time digging through stock screeners. I tracked from the next day‚Äôs opening price.

**4. INVESTORS PLACE**

**TLDR:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Mostly recommend long-term, long shot stocks
* Best recommendations are free. Most paid recommendations are mediocre at best
* News is wrong sometimes
* They are good at spotting long-term trends in where the new money is flowing to, e.g. thematic investing (online gambling, EVs, rare minerals, etc). I derived value from seeing companies linked to these trends I may not have heard of otherwise.

They make an obscene amount of recommendations across their blog and have many subsidiary newsletter services and promotional picks, so my tracking here is admittedly biased, as I only tracked what I ended up buying. Like Fool, they have a very long investing horizon and may end up being right‚Ä¶years from now. They make recommendations based on thematic trends, e.g. EVs, cybersecurity, etc. However, they also push recommendations based on events or news.

I signed up for Matt McCall‚Äôs Investment Opportunities and followed their website recommendations. The newsletter divided up stock recommendations along long-term thematic investing trends like AI, 5G, EVs, online gambling, precious metals, crypto, data analytics, etc).

Their basic principal is long-term investing along big emerging trends. There were about 50 stocks or so in the portfolio at any given time, but since they do long-term investing, many had been in there for years and they offered no advice on how to enter a trade they had entered 4 years ago. So I never did.

Here are the ones they recommended as buys that I actually bought:

**Pct of Recommendations Up: 27%**

**AVG Return**: Not able to calculate this since I didn‚Äôt take advice to hold long term for most

EV Maker. Return: -100%

I purchased some call options in this EV company (name blocked by mods) because they made an announcement the company was a shoe-in to get an $8B EV supplier contract with the U.S. Postal Service. They claimed there were no other competitors that made EVs and therefore this would be a game changer for the company. I didn‚Äôt do my own due diligence, stupidly. A few weeks later, the award went to Oshkash, a defense contractor most known for making military vehicles. Oshkash[ partnered](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36826291/ford-supplier-usps-postal-truck/) with Ford on the contract to make the EVs. I lost 100% of my call options on this poorly sourced news piece.

7.15.21. Buy SWBI. Smith and Wesson: -40% since then. I sold it when there was a pop for breakeven returns after a shooting, which triggered an increase in price, sadly.

1.4.21 Buy Chinese Pharma. Return: -48%

The return here has not been good as of late but it was up and I‚Äôm holding anyway as this company is the gatekeeper for a lot of large Pharmaceutical companies (Novartis, AstraZeneca, Amgen) to get into the Chinese market. In my view, it was a good recommendation and was largely up until recently.

1.21.21. BUY (Block by mod bots): Return: +100% or 0% Correctly predicted the stock would double. It did, then gave up 100% of its gains. Glad I sold it when it doubled.

1.22.21 Buy ad company (blocked by mods). Return: -76%. My stop loss triggered at -12%.

2.1.21 Blocked by mod bots (rare earth minerals company). Return: +32% This was a good pick. I actually bought on the rec and made about 50% from trading options and selling covered calls. I would not have known about this stock without them. I plan to buy it back at 25. They are one of the few providers of the rare earth minerals in every electronic outside of China.

2.4.21 Buy ACAD - Acadia Pharmaceuticals. Return: -71%. Their report cited 30% revenue growth and a robust pipeline of drugs. Revenue is around 17% growth now. At one point it had doubled in value. I‚Äôm still holding. My lesson learned: trade biotechs, don‚Äôt hold them.

2.5.21 Buy REDACTED BY MODS. Return: -60%

Straight downhill since the recommendation. Touted as a cutting edge AI/Machine learning data analytics company I bought 100 shares. Revenues are up 50% y/y but I sold it in February 2022 for a -20% loss.

2.10.21 Buy rare earth minerals company. Return: +69%

Another good pick in a sector I knew nothing about prior to their recommendation. I have since sold it but was up +60% when I closed out. I will buy it again at some point when commodity prices have cooled.

Feb 2021 Buy ILMN (Illumina - genetics company). Return since: -49% They pushed this stock hard and it tanked after each[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/ilmn-stock-will-be-unstoppable-once-the-grail-acquisition-gets-approved/), which made me believe it was a pump and dump job. I traded options on this one and cut losses -28%.

2.19.21. Buy (blocked by mod bots) Return: -94% Thankfully stop lossed this one at -7%.

Feb 26 2021 Buy FTCH (Farfetch 2nd hand clothing): Return: -85% I traded options on this one, using their[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/02/farfetch-stock-buy-the-dip-in-ftch/) as the pump I dumped and made 20%.

2.5.21. Buy (Blocked by mod bots). Return: -72%. Still holding. They offer sports gambling online and were growing revenues 75% y/ but it‚Äôs slowed to 16% growth.

2.10.21 Buy online gambling co (blocked by mods). Return: -15%. Bought this one as the online gambling is doing well. We shall see.

12.17.21 Buy NIO. Return since: -55%. I traded a few options on it but generally think EVs are overvalued and risky given the huge capital expenditures and exposure to macroeconomic issues. I ended up a few percent as I sold after an initial bump.

**$TGTX Price Action Forecast**

1. 75%\~80% chance of FDA approval by 12/28/22
2. If FDA approves the drug:

If FDA requires black box labeling (the less likely case), the upside might be $12\~$15

If FDA requires NO black box labeling (the more likely case), the upside might be $15\~$20

1. If FDA does NOT approve the drug: $TGTX would drop to $4\~$5/share and become a zombie stock
2. We are expecting $150MM sales in 2023, maybe $300MM sales in 2024

If P/E ratio= 20,

then $23/share is a fair market value in 2H 2023

then $42/share is a fair market value in 2H 2024

**The Risk of Investing TGTX Here**

1. FDA does NOT approve this drug. We only see the data that $TGTX management told us, but not the data they submitted to FDA
2. FDA might haven't inspected $TGTX production facility due to work-from-home situations like we have seen in the $VERU FDA approval case this year, causing the PDUFA date to be delayed
3. Even if TG-1101 is approved, marketing will be difficult.
4. insurance coverage and fees will be the critical part. Plus $TGTX doesn't have enough sales and marketing experience compared to large pharma
5. The first few months of sales will be slow until the insurance J Code assigned
6. Competitors
7. Management: The CEO asked for $40M compensation last year

Buffet cites the recent announcement by Procter &amp; Gamble (PNG) regarding its use of derivatives, which began as interest rate swaps but eventually involved writing puts on large quantities of bonds. Buffet notes that the use of derivatives, which involve borrowing large amounts of money and the potential for either making a lot of money or losing a lot quickly, has historically led to trouble. He also acknowledges that derivatives serve useful purposes, but warns that they have the potential for creating financial risk.

## Outlook For Markets And Volatility

* Until recently, it was thought that a soft landing and upturn in the economic cycle would follow the significant increase in interest rates and global geopolitical uncertainty
* However, this view has been abandoned due to further market and economic weakness potentially occurring as a result of central bank overtightening
* The outlook for the market in 2023 includes two periods: market turmoil and economic decline that will force a pivot, followed by an economic and asset recovery
* The timing and severity of the downturn is uncertain, but financial markets may react sooner and more violently than the economy itself
* The pivot, which will coincide with peak short-term rates, USD, and market volatility, will require central banks (primarily the Fed) to signal cutting rates
* This pivot may be prompted by economic deterioration, an increase in unemployment, market volatility, a decline in risky assets, and a decline in inflation
* The market turmoil and subsequent reversal may happen between now and the end of Q1 2023
* Risks to this view include consumer and corporate resilience pushing the downside market scenario to late 2023, or a sharp near-term decline in inflation prompting a Fed pivot without significant economic damage

## U.S. Market Recap &amp; Outlook

* The VIX has averaged around 26 in 2022, up from an average of around 19.5 in 2021
* Volatility is expected to remain above its long-term average in 2023, with the VIX averaging around 25 in the baseline forecast scenario
* Volatility is expected to be biased higher in the early part of the year, as equity markets are expected to fall through this year's lows
* The full year average will depend on the timing of central banks pivoting to an easing bias and the duration/depth of any equity market drawdown
* High volatility may occur in the near term, but is not expected to persist for the full year due to a shift in positioning to align with a recessionary environment having already occurred, and central banks expected to pivot to an easing bias

## European Market Recap &amp; Outlook

* The outlook for risk is uncertain due to the prospect of a recession in the Euro area, energy and geopolitical uncertainty, sensitivity to the likelihood and timing of a potential US recession, and lack of clarity on China reopening
* The VSTOXX median level in 2022 was 27.6, higher than expectations, and similar levels are expected in 2023
* The Euro area is expected to enter a mild recession this winter, with the ECB expected to implement a mildly restrictive policy shift in response
* Political risk in Europe is expected to remain contained in the coming year, with reform efforts set on autopilot and limited event risk
* Inflation is expected to moderate and hit the central bank's target in 2024

## Asian Market Recap &amp; Outlook

* The VHSCEI traded above 40 on 30 days in 2022, driven by policy and macro surprises including strict COVID policies, rising geopolitical uncertainty, and delinquency concerns in the real estate sector
* The VHSCEI is expected to average 30 in 2023, down from 33 in 2022, as headwinds to China-related assets dissipate
* The main driver of the China macro outlook will be the economic reopening, which is expected to be a prolonged process with transitional pains
* Geopolitical tensions with the US are expected to remain a long-term risk factor, with interim signs of stabilization possible
* China's unique position in the monetary policy cycle is expected to keep the local stock market relatively resilient from a slowdown in DM economies
* Offshore China markets are expected to remain more volatile than onshore peers, with foreign investors potentially adjusting underweight China positions in favor of Hong Kong listed equities
* Japan equity implied volatility rose modestly in 2022, with the VNKY averaging 22.9
* The VNKY is expected to remain elevated in 2023, with a target of 25, as monetary policy tightening and a slowing macro environment sustain market volatility

# Volatility Supply And Demand

## Impact of Rising Rates On the Equity Derivatives Market

* Structured products in the US and Europe saw outperformance due to rising long-dated interest rates, while Asian markets and Japan saw little impact
* The effect of rates on structured products was particularly pronounced in the US and Europe, with little impact in most Asian markets and none in Japan
* The performance of long-dated, fixed-strike forwards in the US and Europe outperformed spot due to rising interest rates
* The changes in dividend and vega risk in the Euro STOXX 50 were relatively small compared to the peak-to-trough risk change in 2020 and the change in the HSCEI in 2021
* An increase in implied volatility makes autocallables more attractive and capital protected products less attractive, while an increase in forwards makes autocallables less attractive and capital protected products more attractive
* The relative attractiveness of each type of structured product depends on the relative changes between forwards and equity volatility
* The moves in rates and volatility in 2021 impacted the relative attractiveness of principal-at-risk and principal-protected structures in different markets, with principal-protected structures becoming more attractive in the US and Europe and less attractive in Asia due to rising implied volatility and unchanged forwards, while the opposite occurred in Japan due to rising forwards and unchanged implied volatility.
* Shift from autocallables to capital protected products should reduce the supply of long-dated skew over time, due to less selling of OTM Puts to replicate the Knock-In Barrier of the autocallables

# Trends in Supply/Demand

## US - Short-Dated Volatility

* Short-dated S&amp;P 500 volatility was driven by supply of ATM/upside volatility and demand for downside volatility for protection in 2022 - though this flow imbalance was weaker than normal due to a variety of notable factors:
   * Low investor positioning throughout much of the year required less hedging demand (as you only need to hedge what you are long/overweight)
   * Increased demand for calls from underweight investors to hedge right tail risks (equity-replacement strategies)
   * Moderately lower supply from yield generation/volatility risk premium strategies given the increasing yields available from FI vehicles
* Dealer gamma positioning and market volatility were strongly correlated in 2022 due to weak liquidity conditions and the reinforcing effects of dealers' hedging flows.
* The decline in skew to multi-year lows was due to weak investor positioning, the popularity of put options with a volatility knock-out, and the atypical volatility environment.
* Skew is likely to become steep again when investors re-lever and the effect of volatility knock-out options on skew declines.
* Activity in volatility risk premia strategies remained subdued in 2022, after collapsing in 2020 as the COVID volatility spike led many funds to close or pare back activity
* Systematic variance sellers have all but disappeared, leaving convexity risk-premium trading well above pre-pandemic levels

## Retail Trading

* Retail traders continued to be active in the US options market in 2022, but with slightly lower volume compared to 2021
* Retail traders tend to be buyers of ATM options in very short-dated maturities, but sellers in most other parts of the volatility surface
* Trading activity in zero day to expiry (0DTE) options has significantly grown and now makes up over 40% of total contracts traded
* Retail investors are not the main participants in the 0DTE options market
* Most 0DTE options trades are unwound before the end of the day/expiry
* Transaction costs in vega terms for 0DTE options are up to three times as high as longer-dated options
* Outright option returns for 0DTE options are highly profitable shortly after trade initiation, but delta-hedged option returns are unprofitable
* End users of 0DTE options are likely to be directional high frequency traders, while market makers are willing to supply liquidity due to wider bid-ask spreads and can systematically profit from delta-hedged positions
* The biggest impact of 0DTE options comes from the delta at inception, with a small gamma impact due to the short holding periods of these options.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

## Long Dated Volatility

* The supply/demand balance in long-dated US volatility space comes from three primary sources: insurance companies, structured products, and vol spread players
* In recent years, the balance between insurance demand and structured product supply has tipped towards the supply side due to decreased insurance demand and increased structured product issuance
* This has led to gradual pressure on long-dated S&amp;P 500 implied volatility and dividend levels
* Vol spread trading activity declined significantly during the pandemic and has not recovered
* Insurance hedging flows have been in decline in recent years due to a number of VA issuers scaling back or closing their businesses, net flows being negative for several years, and new products being issued with less demand for hedges
* Long-term S&amp;P 500 volatility demand from VA hedgers was subdued in 2022 and fell year-on-year, but there was an opportunistic demand surge late in the year as insurers reloaded on long-dated option hedges
* The adoption of LDTI in 2023 could lead to an uptick in insurance hedging demand, but the impact is likely to be more pronounced on the rates side than in equities
* The structural decline in VA hedging demand is expected to continue, with VA sales forecast to be 10% lower in 2022 than in 2021
* The growth in structured product issuance has led to a surplus of long-dated volatility supply
* Vol spread trading activity is expected to remain low in the near term, with only modest growth expected in the long term
* The balance between insurance demand and structured product supply is expected to continue tilting towards the supply side, leading to further pressure on long-dated S&amp;P 500 implied volatility and dividends

# 2023 US Trade Ideas

## Credit/Equity Relative Value

**Buy a 3M ATM SPY Put vs. Selling 1.7x the Notional in 3M ATM LQD Puts for zero net cost**

&gt;*""In the US HG 2023 Outlook, JPM's credit strategists forecast HG bond spreads to tighten to 155bps, in-line with the 10y average and implying nearly a 10% total return for high-quality credit, as spreads will tighten modestly even as the economy remains weak and may slip into a shallow recession. Specifically, higher quality assets with attractive yields will be in favor in 2023 and the team expects reallocations towards IG corporate credit from previously painful allocations to higher risk alternatives. Conversely, in the 2023 Global Equity Strategy Outlook, JPM's equity strategists expect the S&amp;P500 to retest this year's lows in 1H23 as the Fed overtightens into weaker fundamentals. This sell-off combined with disinflation, rising unemployment, and declining corporate sentiment should be enough for the Fed to start signaling a pivot, subsequently driving an asset recovery.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""Fundamentally, we like how LQD represents the potential upside in high-quality US corporate credit, and remain comfortable selling the expensive, relative implied volatility in LQD to buy cheaper option volatility in SPY. While LQD has fallen 15% YTD, shares have rebounded just over 10% since reaching a YTD low of $99.20 in mid-October, a level LQD has not reached since before 2010. LQD shares represent a high-quality USD IG portfolio, with an average BBB+ rating, 3.7% weighted-average coupon, weighted-average duration of 8.6 years, 5.2% YTW, and a weighted-average bond holding price of around $90. LQD holds IG credits in Financials (31%), Consumer, Non-Cyclical (20%), Communications (13%), and Technology (10%). If central bankers do pivot on interest rate policy next year, investors could view LQD as an attractive alternative to play longer-term interest rates, given LQD's average duration is in-line with the current 10y UST, but with a higher YTW compared to the 10y UST's YTW of 3.6%.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""As S&amp;P 500 consensus earnings fell this year, SPY shares have fallen 13% YTD, but did also rebound over 12% off October lows. However, a further decline in earnings expectations for next year, given continuing weakness in US economic conditions, will provide for increased volatility and equity downside. Contrasting LQD's relative historical cheapness, the S&amp;P 500 currently trades at nearly 20x JPM's Strategists' estimated 2023 earnings of $205, a premium to its 10y average of 16x.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""As illustrated in the figure below, the LQD/SPY 3M Implied Volatility ratio is in its 95th percentile over the past 5 years, though only moderately above the realized volatility ratio, illustrating the relative richness of LQD implied volatility vs. SPY. As such, we recommend selling puts in LQD to fund puts on SPY, premium neutral, to position for our 2023 outlook that sees high-grade corporate credit spreads outperforming US equities into next year.*

[Ratio Between LQD And SPX 3-Month At-the-Forward Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/b4a5t4xjca8a1.png?width=472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6438f5de1105187ceb0df903d10ad0e7d605afea)

# Skew/Convexity Trades

## Monetize the Rich Convexity Risk Premium

**Convexity On The S&amp;P 500 Is Still Trading At Distressed Levels; JPM Recommends Monetizing It**

&gt;*""The implied convexity risk premium, for example measured by the spread between variance swaps and ATMF volatility, surged in early 2020 and has continued to trade at around* ***twice*** *its pre-pandemic levels over the past \~2.5 years, and US indices exhibit among the highest convexity levels across major global indices. As discussed in the Volatility Supply/Demand section, the convexity richness is sustained by tail hedging demand and a dearth of Vol Risk-Premium sellers. While we don't see an immediate catalyst to pressure implied convexity levels lower, selling this Risk-Premium makes for an attractive carry trade to play the Implied-to-Realized spread.*

[1-Year Variance Less At-the-Forward Volatility \(Left\); Ratio of Vol vs. Var Swap \(Right\)](https://preview.redd.it/qy2yswlrca8a1.png?width=990&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23782bff2dc1e91561f34289ad1c7b4e5ea8ed57)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*""Therefore, we recommend monetizing the rich convexity, for example, via the following structures:*  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ñ∫ ***Sell 1x Dec'23 Variance Swap vs. Buying 0.85x The Vega Notional In Dec'23 Vol Swaps On SPX***  
&gt;  
&gt;*""The terminal payout (if held to maturity) is linked solely to the SPX's Realized Volatility over the life of the trade, and rich convexity levels allow investors to obtain a wide breakeven range and elevated maximum payout. We ratio the two legs in order to skew the breakeven range lower. The Variance-Vol swap spread is currently indicatively bid at 3.7 points; this structure allows investors to collect a maximum 3.5 times the Vega Notional if the index realizes near 24%, and returns a positive P/L if realized volatility over the next year falls between 10% and 38%. The structure returns &gt;2 Vega profit if realized volatility falls between 15% and 33.5%. Investors can also consider similar structures on the Russell 2000 and Nasdaq 100, where convexity is similarly rich.*  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ñ∫ ***Buy Dec'23 50% Up-Variance vs. Selling Vanilla Variance On The SPX***  
&gt;  
&gt;*""In this structure, an investor indicatively collects 1.75 Vega of annualized carry as long as the SPX trades above 50% of its starting level (i.e., above a spot price of \~2000). If the SPX dips below this barrier, the investor is naked short variance at a strike of 29, only for the period the index trades below this level.*

&amp;#x200B;

## Relative Value in VIX vs. SPX Tail Hedge

&gt;*""We noticed previously a relative value trade opportunity between VIX and SPX 1M Skew. We apply the same analysis for 3M Skew. As of 12/5/2022, the VIX and SPX 3M Skewness, and 3M Implied and Realized Correlation are shown in the images below. We see that the 3M VIX vs. SPX Skewness difference is on the low end (8th Percentile) with a Z-Score of \~1.37. Also, the implied vs. realized correlation plot shows that implied correlation is on the high end (absolute value) and the correlation spread between implied vs. realized is at around peak. Therefore, VIX Skew is rich, while SPX Skew is cheap - historically speaking. The relative value trade with short VIX OTM Call &amp; long SPX OTM Put is recommended in the image below.*

## Machine Learning Based Dispersion Trades

&gt;*""It is our long-held belief that names with extreme factor exposures are likely to experience higher volatility. One reason is that stock volatility is increasingly attributable to factor rotations, which are in-turn driven by macro factors such as bond yields. 2022 has been an eventful year for the equity market due to the hawkish turn in central bank policies globally. Without pontificating on the future direction of bond yields, we believe that factor driven equity volatility is likely to be sustained for the foreseeable future.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""In this section, we propose a new SPX Dispersion Portfolio constructed using our machine learning based methodology.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***SPX Bespoke Dispersion***  
&gt;  
&gt;*""We propose the following SPX dispersion portfolio, selected from an expanded universe of S&amp;P members with the highest option liquidity. Based on the volatility and fundamental factor data of our stock universe, a weighted portfolio of 30 names is constructed. As a reminder, we optimize the stock selection by jointly maximizing the members' volatility carry and factor exposures. The constituents are seen in the table below.*

&amp;#x200B;

## Vanilla Index Hedges

&gt;*""After the significant rally over the past two months, timing for putting on hedges appears good. JPM's Equity Strategists believe that the most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in decades will cause fundamentals to deteriorate next year, driving a significant fall in corporate earnings as the economy enters recession, labor markets contract, and consumers and corporates cut discretionary spending and capital investments. This is likely to cause markets to draw down early next year, before rallying later in the year once central banks pivot to finish the year moderately higher (\~5%).*  
&gt;  
&gt;***S&amp;P 500 OTM Puts***  
&gt;  
&gt;*""S&amp;P 500 Skew has come down sharply this year as low positioning reduced the demand for downside hedges and higher rates/volatility lowered the supply of call overwrites (See the Volatility Supply/Demand Section). Meanwhile, sharply higher short-term rates this year have shifted forwards higher, cheapening the cost of OTM Puts (as options are priced relative to the forward, not the spot level). Thus, despite the high macro risks, pricing of OTM Vanilla Puts is relatively inexpensive thanks to these technical factors - for example, the premium to buy a 3M 95% Put on the S&amp;P 500 is in just its 30th percentile relative to the last 3 years of history. Investors should therefore look to put on hedges given the weak outlook for markets, while taking advantage of the historically flat skew and high forwards by buying OTM Puts, which price well in this environment. Investors can consider for example:*

S&amp;P is supposed to rocket again after Q3 2023 and its a steady stock meaning even if it goes down again I can always expect it to go up eventually so I don't mind permanent holding and in 30 years that hold profit will be crazy anyways 

Now I will pay the 6-7% interest once and pay no tax or interest on gains, I will use this as a source of income + Job income to live and survive I will be joining a trade union making significantly less money as an apprentice

My son was informed today by his grandfather that he will be added into his will. Perhaps receive in the range of $100k usd when the time comes. He is about to graduate from college in a little over a year. Not sure where he‚Äôs gonna end up living or getting a job. I currently manage his investing through Wells Fargo. (~25k from high school/college jobs and birthday gifts throughout his life) (He will receive full access to this when he graduates.) And will probably need to buy a car at this point with those funds. (ignore that).



I personally would put it in a high yield savings until he is ready to buy a house. (FHA loan 3% down?) in a little over a year or so.

I recommended him getting a duplex, living in one side for 2 years, then moving and renting out his unit and put a larger down payment on where he actually wants to stay. (I always wanted to get into real estate so I am more than willing to learn this along with him).

Is there any way to invest it safely instead of using a high yield savings account?

or any other ways he can responsibly manage this amount at his age?

3030,StockMarket,"Last month I discovered this company Green Giant Inc. (GGE). It is a small-cap player with Chinese background in the alternative energy industry. What caught my attention was its main business model ‚Äì of course, as I believe that climate and energy are the most significant investing theme for at least the next ten years. This company has recently appointed a new CEO and illustrated their business model for the alternative energy ambition for the first time. And I must admit it is exciting. According to the CEO, their ambitious plan is cooperating with American companies by providing experts (technical engineers) to ‚Äúdecarbonize‚Äù them, as well as investing in promising companies in this field.

Investing in a Chinese company that mostly operate in China could be scary, but I would argue that investing in a Chinese company that mainly operating abroad, investing in the US, and with an experienced American management team may be not. On the contrary, it might provide an excellent opportunity to capitalize the easing of the Covid restrictions and economic reopening of China. The China-US relationship is not at its best time, especially in tech and geopolitics where the competition is expected to continue. However, the cooperating in fighting climate change is not expected to end, as both countries have¬†made some very solid commitments at various global climate conferences recently.

It is generally difficult to predict with certainty when a stock's price will go up or down. Stock prices are influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic conditions, company performance, and market trends, and it is often difficult to predict how these factors will impact a particular stock's price.

That being said, there are some signs that may indicate that a stock's price is likely to increase in the future:

1. Positive earnings reports: If a company releases strong earnings reports, with revenues and profits exceeding expectations, this may signal that the company is performing well and that its stock price may rise.
2. Improving industry conditions: If the industry in which a company operates is experiencing growth or positive trends, this may indicate that the company's stock price may also increase.
3. Increasing demand for the company's products or services: If a company's products or services are in high demand, this may signal that the company is performing well and that its stock price may rise.
4. Positive news or developments: If a company announces positive news or developments, such as new partnerships or product launches, this may also indicate that its stock price may increase.

It is important to note that these are just a few potential indicators and that there are no guarantees when it comes to the stock market. It is always important to do your own research and carefully consider the risks before investing in any particular stock.",I asked Chat GPT when will stocks price go up,1671837117

# **S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq close higher Friday, but fall for a third straight week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose Friday, but still posted a weekly loss as recession fears continue to batter investor sentiment.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6% to 3,844.82, while the and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% to close at 10,497.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 176.44 points higher, or 0.5%, to 33,203.93.
*****
&gt; The major indexes oscillated earlier in the session after the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred gauge of inflation, came in slightly hotter than economists expected on a year-over-year basis, indicating that inflation is sticking despite the Fed‚Äôs efforts to fight it.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe economic numbers announced today highlight the difficulty for investors today, where weak numbers bring recession fears and strong numbers bring Fed fear,‚Äù said Louis Navellier, founder and chief investment officer of growth investing firm Navellier &amp; Associates.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúYou just can‚Äôt win right now on macro numbers,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThat is why it‚Äôs now much more of a stock-picking market, but with all the index and ETF traders even stocks that are executing their business plan well can get pushed around meaningfully by associated losers.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week down about 0.2% for the week, posting its third straight weekly decline. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, lost 2% for the week, also for the third down week in a row. The Dow was the outperformer, posting a 0.9% gain.
*****
&gt; Recession fears have resurged recently dashing some investors‚Äô hope for a year-end rally and leading to big losses in December. Investors worry that overtightening from central banks worldwide could force the economy into a downturn.
*****
&gt; For December, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 5.8%, while the Dow and Nasdaq have lost more than 4% and 8.5%, respectively. Those are the biggest monthly declines for the major averages since September. Stocks are also on pace for their worst annual performance since 2008.

&gt; # What You Need to Know About the Bank of Japan‚Äôs (Unexpected) Monetary Policy Change

&gt; The Bank of Japan (BOJ) made a surprise decision on Tuesday to widen the allowed trading band for 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) from ~25 to ~50 basis points. This move signals a shift in the BOJ‚Äôs approach to monetary policy and inflation and is likely to be sustained by the incoming governor of the BOJ.

&gt; For context, Japan has implemented a dovish monetary policy stance for years, with the BOJ‚Äôs rates remaining at 0% and large-scale quantitative easing being standard practice. The central bank has targeted a range around zero for the benchmark government bond yield since 2016 and has used this as a tool to keep overall market interest rates low. The policy change could alter the flow of capital from Japan, a major exporter of capital.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/JGB-vs-UST.png))**

&gt; The decision to widen the trading band caused the yen to spike and bond yields to rise. This caught investors off guard, who had expected the BOJ to wait to make changes to its yield curve control until Governor Haruhiko Kuroda steps down in April. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield has spiked to 0.47%, close to the BOJ‚Äôs newly set implicit cap.

&gt; # The Largest Buyers of U.S. Treasuries, But for How Long?
&gt; Japanese investors have historically sought investment opportunities outside of Japan, and as of October 2022, they were the largest holders of US Treasuries. The BOJ‚Äôs decision can significantly alter this flow of capital, causing Japanese investors to reconsider purchasing US Treasuries. The market is currently pricing in higher Japanese yields and a stronger yen. The rise in Japanese government bond (JGB) yield provides an increased incentive for Japanese investors to keep cash at home amid the global economic slowdown. This has the potential to negatively affect foreign risk assets, as well as strengthen the Yen versus the US Dollar.

&gt; # A Preview of Things to Come?
&gt; The Bank of Japan‚Äôs (BOJ) low-interest rate policy and its consistent purchase of bonds to maintain its yield cap have been criticized for distorting the yield curve, reducing market liquidity, and contributing to the yen‚Äôs depreciation, which has increased the cost of importing raw materials. The main question is whether this is a one-time adjustment or if we are getting a preview of what Japan‚Äôs new monetary policy approach will be moving forward.

&gt; This unexpected move by the Bank of Japan has the potential to be a headwind to the US Dollar as the Japanese Yen strengthens. We‚Äôll continue to monitor the implications of the hawkish move by the Bank of Japan and be sure to keep you updated along the way.

&gt; # Russell 1,000 Stocks Down the Most from All-Time Highs

&gt; As we wrap up an awful year for the stock market, below we highlight a list of the current Russell 1,000 stocks that are the farthest below their all-time highs. For the index as a whole, the average stock is down 15.85% YTD on a total return basis, while the average stock's price is about 38% below its all-time high.

&gt; About 30% of stocks in the Russell 1,000 are currently at least 50% below their all-time highs, while about 10% of index members are at least 75% below all-time highs. Below we list the 38 stocks that are all down at least 85% from their all-time highs and it includes Palantir's (PLTR) 85.96% drop to Plug Power's (PLUG) near evaporation of 99.2%. Most of these names have come down from all-time highs that were made at some point in 2021, although some like PLUG, AIG, and Citi (C) made highs a long time ago.

&gt; This list is a who's who of stocks that got caught up in the post-COVID retail investor buying spree. A name like Carvana (CVNA) hit its all-time high of $376.69 relatively recently in August of last year. It's at $4.13/share as of this morning. Upstart (UPST) traded above $400/share last October, and it's at $13 and change now. Roku (ROKU) got up to $490.40 last summer and is at $42 now or more than a full decimal point to the left!

&gt; # The Best and Worst Performing Stocks of 2022 (through 12/22)

&gt; Below are lists of the best and worst performing Russell 1,000 stocks year-to-date on a total return basis. We'll start with the worst first. Five stocks in the index are down more than 90% this year: Carvana (CVNA), Opendoor (OPEN), Novavax (NVAX), Upstart (UPST), and Affirm (AFRM). Another eleven are down more than 80%, which includes names like Coinbase (COIN), Twilio (TWLO), Wayfair (W), Lucid (LCID), and Roku (ROKU).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/riydownytd.png))**

&gt; Seventy-two percent of stocks in the Russell 1,000 are down YTD, but below are the names that have bucked the trend and gained the most. Just three stocks are up more than 100% YTD: Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Signify Health (SGFY), and Texas Pacific (TPL). Of the 38 names shown, 23 are from the Energy sector, with big names like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and ConocoPhillips (COP) included. Exxon's 78.8% YTD gain is easily its biggest annual move higher since at least 1980. Merck (MRK) is the biggest of the non-Energy stocks that made the list with a YTD gain of 49.8%.

&gt; # Day After Christmas NASDAQ &amp; Russell 2000 Up 73.5% Of Time

&gt; Santa Claus Rally starts today. The Santa Claus Rally was discovered and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 and published in our 1973 Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanacas the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year. This short, sweet rally is usually good for about 1.3% on the S&amp;P 500, but the real significance of the SCR is as an indicator.

&gt; It is our first seasonal indicator of the year ahead. Years when there was no Santa Claus Rally tended to precede bear markets or times when stocks hit significantly lower prices later in the year. As Yale‚Äôs famous line states (2023 Almanac page 118): ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù

&gt; NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have logged the greatest frequency and magnitude of gains on the day after Christmas. Since 1988, NASDAQ has advanced 73.5% of the time with an average move of +0.42%. R2K has also advanced 73.5% of the time with an average advance of +0.40%. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have slightly softer records, but bullish, nonetheless.

&gt; Two days after Christmas, the market is less bullish with NASDAQ down more often than up. Three days after Christmas R2K small caps take the lead advancing 64.7% of the time with an average gain of +0.46%.

&gt; Looking further out, from 1950-1985 last 5 trading days of the year S&amp;P 500 up 34 of 36 years, average gain 1.24%. 1986-2021 up 19 of 36, average gain 0.43%.

&gt; # Is it Finally Time for The Santa Claus Rally?

&gt; ‚ÄúIf Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù
‚ÄîYale Hirsh

&gt; One of the little-known facts about the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) is that it isn‚Äôt the entire month of December but is actually only seven days. Discovered in 1972 by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac (carried on now by his son Jeff Hirsch), the real SCR is the final five trading days of the year and first two trading days of the following year, not just December. In other words, the official SCR is set to begin tomorrow, Friday, December 23, 2022.

&gt; Historically, it turns out these seven days indeed have been quite jolly, as no seven-day combo is more likely to be higher (up 79.2% of the time), and only two combos have a better average return for the S&amp;P 500 than the 1.33% average return during the official Santa Claus Rally period.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-188.png))**

&gt; Here‚Äôs a chart we shared recently showing that it is the latter half of December when most of the seasonally strong gains occur.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-255.png))**

&gt; These seven days tend to be in the green, so that is expected. But fun trivia stat, the SCR has been higher the past six years and hasn‚Äôt been higher seven years in a row since the ‚Äò70s. The all-time record was an incredible 10-year winning streak in the ‚Äò50s and ‚Äò60s. Here we show all the SCR periods since the tech bubble and how the S&amp;P 500 does after each.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-356.png))**

&gt; The bottom line is that what really matters to investors is when Santa doesn‚Äôt come, as Mr. Hirsch noted in the quote at the start of this blog.

&gt; Here we show some recent times investors were given coal during these seven days, and the results after aren‚Äôt very good at all. The past five times that the SCR was negative saw January down as well. Then consider when there was no SCR in 2000 and 2008, not the best times for investors, and potentially some major warnings that something wasn‚Äôt right. Lastly, the full year was negative in 1994 and 2015 after no Santa. We like to say in the Carson Investment Research team that hope isn‚Äôt a strategy, but I‚Äôm hoping for some green during the SCR!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-46.png))**

&gt; Finally, the average gains each year for the S&amp;P 500 is 9.3% and is higher 71.8% of the time. But when there is a SCR, those numbers jump to 10.5% and 73.2%, falling to only 5.0% and 66.7% when there is no Santa. Sure, this is only one indicator, and we suggest following many more indicators to base your investment decisions, but this is clearly something we wouldn‚Äôt ignore either.

&gt; # Don‚Äôt Lose Faith Yet

&gt; Stocks have sold off hard after the Fed took a more hawkish-than-expected tone last week, which now has stocks looking at one of their worst December returns ever. The good news is that there is still time, and one of the most bullish times of the year is right around the corner.

&gt; We will discuss in more detail the Santa Claus rally tomorrow, as it officially starts on Friday. But today, I‚Äôll do a quick blog with a table that is always very popular.

&gt; As you can see, this table breaks down how each day of the year does. In my opinion, we are amid some of the strongest days of the year, from late December to early January. With stocks quite oversold and sentiment extremely negative, we expect a rally quite soon.

&gt; # No Worse Year for Sentiment

&gt; The past few weeks had been uneventful when it comes to the AAII's weekly reading on investor sentiment. As we noted last week, the three-week range that bullish sentiment occupied had reached a record low hovering between 24.3% and 24.7%. In the latest release, sentiment finally moved but not in the most promising direction. Bullish sentiment dropped 4 percentage points down to 20.3% this week to make for the lowest reading since the end of September.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; With a decline in neutral sentiment as well, all of the increase went to bears with that reading rising to the highest level and back above 50% for the first time since late October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; As a result of the large inverse moves of the two sentiment readings, the bull-bear spread shows a dramatic tilt towards an even more pessimistic bias with bears outnumbering bulls by 32 percentage points. That is the widest spread since the week of October 20th and lower than most of the past decade's range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; With yet another week of bears outnumbering bulls, the record streak of negative readings in the bull-bear spread has grown to 38 weeks long; a full month longer than the previous record ending in October 2020. Historically, investor sentiment has acted as a contrarian indicator meaning low readings on optimism have typically been followed by stronger returns for the S&amp;P 500. This time around, sentiment and prices have given each other little reason to turn around.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-5.png))**

&gt; In an earlier post, we noted how there has not even been a single week this year in which bullish sentiment has been above the historical average of 37.6%. Taking another look at just how depressed sentiment has been, the average bullish sentiment reading in 2022 has been less than 25%. The only years that had come close to such a low reading were 1988 (27.29%) and 1990 (27.08%). Playing into that low average has been the fact that there have been a record 30 weeks this year with bullish sentiment coming in below 25%. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment has averaged 46.17% this year, slightly above the previous record of 45.2% in 2008. With bearish sentiment tipping back above 50% once again this week, there have now been 17 weeks with such an elevated reading, tying the record from 2008 with one week to go.

&gt; # Malaise Among Individual Investors

&gt; The misery of 2022 has continued when it comes to investor sentiment. In the latest weekly AAII poll, bullish sentiment declined from 24.3% down to 20.3%. That's the lowest reading since the end of September and less than five points above the YTD low of 15.8% from mid-April.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-aaii.png))**

&gt; As shown in the chart above, there hasn't been a single week this year where bullish sentiment has been above its historical average of 37.6%, and the only week where sentiment was even close to its historical average was at the start of the year. With just one week left in the year, barring a historic one-week surge, 2022 will go down as the first year in the history of the AAII survey where there wasn't a single week that bullish sentiment was above average. Talk about malaise.

&gt; # Mega-Caps Down $5 Trillion in Market Cap, AMZN Now Down $1+ Trillion

&gt; As we approach the end of 2022, below is an updated look at the drawdown in market cap that we've seen in the US equity space since major indices peaked on the first trading day of the year. Using the Russell 3,000 as a proxy, the US stock market has seen an $11.7 trillion drawdown from the peak on 1/3/22. The max drawdown was $13.6 trillion at the low on 9/30, so we've seen market cap increase by just under $2 trillion since then. In dollar terms, this drawdown has been more extreme than anything investors have ever experienced. That's pretty deflationary if you ask us!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/drawdownray.png))**

&gt; Of the $11.7 trillion drawdown in US equity market cap, just over $5 trillion of the drop has come from six companies! Below is a look at the six current and former ""trillion dollar market cap"" club members that have now collectively lost about $5.07 trillion in market cap from their peaks. As shown, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) have all lost at least $750 billion in market cap from their highs. And Amazon (AMZN) is the first to lose more than $1 trillion in market cap! Just a few years ago, no company had a market cap of more than a trillion dollars, and now we have a company that has lost more than a trillion dollars in market cap.

&gt; For all six of these companies, their current drawdowns are easily their biggest on record. Apple (AAPL) has lost $880 billion, Alphabet (GOOGL) is down $846 billion, Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA) are both down more than $760 billion, and Microsoft (MSFT) is down $784 billion even though it was down close to a trillion at its lows in November.

3076,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**:  Price ""floated"" on very low volume (50% of average) and remained entirely within yesterday's candle.  With the sideays chop seen this week, an argument could be made that we are 5 or 6 days into a bear flag forming off the latest down move from December 12 - 16.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**: Nearest resistance at 386.58, then 389.63 gap fill with major resistance at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill.  Nearest support at 380.54 to 378.28 -- major support at 365

&amp;#x200B;

**QQQ:** Price again recovered off support at 263.32 -- major resistance remains at 280.72 -- where bullish consolidation broke down. Major support is between 260.85 to 261.21 the COVID-low TL. 

&amp;#x200B;

**IWM:** Most ""bullish"" price action today of any major, but definitely relative.  Nearest resistance is 175.68 -- then major at 180.19 gap-fill. Nearest support is that same 171.18 pivot low, with 167.78 to 167.55 being a major level.

Epic run by the Chinese stocks since late-October.  I kept a small 0.5% position just in the event this continues to run; however, I expect a pullback to $3.25 and will add more there.

I took a 0.5% position because I could see price continue floating up next week given the holiday volume; if it does, I will add another 0.5% at 97.75 and then a full 1% at the $99 double top from April 21st.  First target to cover is $87, followed by the ascending TL between $78 - $80.

*How does this stack up vs history? This ranks in the 19th percentile amongst all buy and sell estimates in absolute dollar value over the past three years and in the 24th percentile going back to Jan 2000.*  
*This ranks in the 72nd percentile amongst all estimates on a net basis (-$70bn to +$150bn scale) over the past three years and in the 70th percentile going back to Jan 2000.*  
*Monthly portfolio performance: US equity underperformed fixed-income by -6.13% in the month of December: S&amp;P total-return -6.24%, 10yr total-return -0.11%*  
*Quarterly portfolio performance: US equity outperformed fixed-income by +5.01% in the Q4: S&amp;P total-return +7.01%, 10yr total-return +2.00%*

On Dec 22, the three major indexes all closed lower by more than 1%. At the close, the Dow dropped 1.04%, the Nasdaq dropped 2.18%, and the S&amp;P 500 was down 1.4%.

&amp;#x200B;

The lower tail for SPY is much long than the upper tail and this could be a bullish reversal signal for the market in the short-term. Yesterday‚Äôs low could be a short-term support in the future. Right now, the SMA20 &amp; SMA200 are both moving downward while the SMA50 is moving upward on the daily chart. It is interesting that yesterday high almost touched the lower band of equilibrium area with only 10 cents distance, and then the price fell and closed at $380.72. This kind of price action normally means that SPY is having trouble fighting against the short-term down-trend.

&amp;#x200B;

QQQ was down 2.45% and formed a hammer on the daily chart that is extended on the downside, though the lower tail needs to be longer for it to be a perfectly tradable hammer. Yesterday low could be important for the next couple days.

&amp;#x200B;

The 10-year US Treasury yield rose 0.491% to 3.682%, compared with a yield spread of -59 bps over the two-year note while VIX was up 9.47%. Brent crude closed down 0.4%. Spot gold closed down 1.21% at $1,792.63.03 an ounce. The dollar index was up 0.14%, closing at 104.39.

&amp;#x200B;

US Q3 final real GDP annualized came at 3.2% vs. 2.90% expected. Analysts said a breakdown of Q3 GDP data shows net exports contributed the most to growth, along with housing investment and inventory. U.S. initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled 216,000 for the week ended Dec. 17, versus 222,000 expected and 211,000 previously reported. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits was little changed and remained near historically low levels, underscoring companies' reluctance to lay off workers in a supply-constrained labor market, which economists said would be a red flag for the labor market.

3150,StockMarket,"Today is the last trading day before Christmas, Core PCE Price Index will release at 8:30 EST which will have an important impact on the market.

What‚Äôs Core PCE Price Index?

Here is what I found: The Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index measures the changes in the price of goods and services purchased by consumers for the purpose of consumption, excluding food and energy. Prices are weighted according to total expenditure per item. 

Potatoes and bread can make me feel less hungry. When the price of bread goes up and the price of potatoes stays the same, with my salary remaining the same, I can only buy less bread. 

At this situation, potatoes are used instead of bread when calculating PCE. The Fed has a preference for PCE data as a broader and more robust measure of inflation.

Core PCE Price Index m/m\*: Forecast:0.2%, previous 0.2%. If result more than 0.2%, it means Inflation is not effectively controlled, the Fed may continue to raise interest rates, stock market will fall further.

3152,StockMarket," 

With 12 years of Futures scalping then Forex chart trading using Price action, what I have realized to be successful are the following:

A- Forget everything you read in books about trading, forget chart patterns, and most importantly, forget trading indicators (I am not talking about trading using manual tools, just the automated indicators). All you have access to is meant to force you to trade just like everybody else, and therefore, it allows big players (banks and major institutions) to take action against your positions because you and the other retail traders bring liquidity to the market the big players seek to make money.

B - If I was to rank the most important aspect to retail traders, it would be

1/ Strategy (Build Scenario)

2 / Risk Management (Make Profits)

2/ Money Management (Protect your Capital)

4 / Mind Management (Psychology)

In reality, live traders out there would probably share the opposite view:

First, Psychology &gt;&gt;&gt; Second, Protect your Capital &gt;&gt;&gt; Third, Add to the Profits &gt;&gt;&gt; At last, Build a Scenario

Most traders out there will probably tell you ""work on your Number One aspect : Psychology! Work on your mindset"". The truth very few understands is: How?

The only way to build a strong conviction muscle is.....TO BE CONVINCED!

How? By having strong rules, rules you have put to the test and make them work. That's right, your least important aspect in trading, Strategy, is suddenly intertwined with the notion of Psychology. If you don't believe in your strategy, you will have a weak mindset, no matter how hard you can sustain getting hit by the market. Losing money is a psychological torture, if the idea of losing small is sustainable, try getting hit 20, 30 or 40 times in a row, your mind won't tolerate it eventually. Losing frequently can destroy any mind, just like torture in the army. So to prevent that, your number 1 aspect in trading is the tandem Strategy - Psychology (same level of importance).

Now regarding the last 2 aspect (Money &amp; Risk Management) what is best? To protect your losses, or to make good money. I have heard it all, even thought one was better than the other, then reverse my mind to think the opposite. To finally agree on one thing:

&lt;&gt;Losing small is good in the short run, but winning big is more important in the long run&lt;&gt;

Because we hate wasting time, you tend to fear missing out on the action. So we destroy the money management (loss of capital) by entering late, making the stop loss wider. And when things go wrong, we get hit hard. So Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is wrong. Keeping losses small should be the solution, right?

Well, not exactly. If you don't book profits and don't add to the profits, you don't build the cushion that allows you to lose small. Losing small is dangerous, because your stop loss is tight, you get to lose more frequently. Watching the trade ride is a waste of time, so it is better to capitalize on your time by adding to profits and book intermediate profits. In order to avoid the FOMO effect.

To conclude, Money &amp; Risk Management are equally important, it is a savant dosage to know how to operate the markets perfectly. With years of development and live trading experience, of draining accounts, of now consistently achieving a % with 4 digits per annum, I can assure you:

I would rank the most important aspect to trading as follows:

First, Psychology + Strategy

Second, Money + Risk Management

Before yesterday, I was expecting for a price correction of SPX to 8&amp;21 EMAs. But now it looks like SPX is doing a time correction. Selling power is strong, I don‚Äôt see any point of a rally incoming, unless somewhat good news come out, that may light up some hopes for the buyer. 

The only good news I could think of might come from the economic indicators.

Spoiler in the title, obviously, but here are some charts to consider.

&amp;#x200B;

Housekeeping notes: For ""the strength of the consumer balance sheet,"" I'm using Federal Reserve data that you can find [here.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/z1/balance_sheet/table/)  Specifically, the column of Total Liabilities as a % of Disposable Personal Income.  For S&amp;P 500 returns, I'm using quarterly close (to match the quarterly data from the Federal Reserve), from Q4 1969 to Q3 2022 (because that's as far back as my brokerage has .SPX data).  The .SPX returns are price-only (no dividends) and not inflation-adjusted.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to correlate the 3, 6, 12, and 24 month .SPX returns with liabilities as a percentage of DPI.  Here are the charts:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1: Quarterly household liabilities as a &amp;#37; of disposable personal income, Q4 1969 to Q3 2022.](https://preview.redd.it/szxwrg8nbk7a1.jpg?width=1254&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8524c36caeb8f9cf0d9af0c0a8062cc15f1ff261)

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 2: Correlation between 3-month .SPX return and household liabilities as a percentage of disposable personal income.](https://preview.redd.it/y22tqy70ck7a1.jpg?width=1258&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa9017053d31905bb6811646a8d3626edd163cde)

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 3: Correlation between 6-month .SPX return and household liabilities as a percentage of disposable personal income.](https://preview.redd.it/coshgjncck7a1.jpg?width=1254&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfd1fdb8ee8b3cf583b55d020c7836c80e47aa41)

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 4: Correlation between 1-year .SPX return and household liabilities as a percentage of disposable personal income.](https://preview.redd.it/w7m54u7nck7a1.jpg?width=1257&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0de848f38067e84d65e1568e58e4e92f5447db24)

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 5: Correlation between 2-year .SPX return and household liabilities as a percentage of disposable personal income.](https://preview.redd.it/n5jitkctck7a1.jpg?width=1263&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7872639d59233f13071a480286ceafaf94df0069)

&amp;#x200B;

Interpretation:  household debt isn't in a great place or a terrible place.  It's a little high historically, but it's fairly well off peak.  Fortunately, that doesn't matter for stock returns!  As you can see from figures 4-5, there is essentially zero correlation between the current level of household debt to disposable personal income over 3, 6, 12, and 24 month timeframes.  No trend at all.  Not even a weak correlation.  Every pattern on every timeframe is nearly perfectly random.

3228,StockMarket,"Citadel expects to return about $7 billion in profits to its clients on the back of what is expected to be its most profitable year ever, said people familiar with the firm, highlighting the banner year some hedge funds have had even as others nurse deep wounds.

Citadel‚Äôs flagship fund gained about 32% for the year through November, benefiting from bets across the firm‚Äôs strategies, the people said. The firm plans to return some profits from all four of its funds in early January but still expects to start 2023 with more than $50 billion in assets under management, one of the people said.

Others up significantly this year, including Two Sigma, Brevan Howard Asset Management and D.E. Shaw, also have told clients in certain funds they plan to return some profits, people familiar with the firms said. Bloomberg News earlier reported D.E. Shaw was returning some profits to clients and raising fees.

The war in Ukraine and the parade of Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes have helped create what investors are calling a regime change in markets, benefiting trading-oriented hedge-fund strategies that thrive on volatility and punishing those that make leveraged bets on fast-growing companies.

While Tiger Global Management and other growth-focused hedge funds have issued mea culpas and had years of huge gains erased practically overnight, funds that bet on global macroeconomic shifts and those built on a multimanager-platform model, like Citadel, have flourished in one of the widest divergences industry veterans can recall.

The gains Citadel and the others have notched are all the more noteworthy in a year in which the S&amp;P 500 was down a total 18.5% through Tuesday and a traditional portfolio made up of 60% global stocks and 40% U.S. bonds, including dividends, has lost about 16%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Some managers are pressing their hot hand to win more advantageous terms from their clients. Macro firm Caxton Associates has told clients it is raising performance fees for some share classes of its Caxton Macro fund to as high as 30% on Jan. 1, according to people familiar with the matter. The fund gained more than 30% this year through mid-December. D.E. Shaw is raising performance fees on its three biggest funds to as high as 40%.

**Executive Summary**

The global energy order is going through a once in a century shift. Energy supply chains and the energy mix powering the globe are being completely remade by governments focused not on economic growth but on emissions.  These changes are creating investment opportunities that can last decades for the companies positioned to take advantage.

Largo Inc. (‚ÄúLargo‚Äù), a company unknown to many investors, sits at the epicenter of it all.  Capital 10x‚Äôs deep dive report on Largo will break down the global energy shifts taking place, the opportunities they will create and why Largo may quickly become one of the highest value ways to invest in these multi-decade growth trends.

&amp;#x200B;

Excerpts from the report below:

&amp;#x200B;

**The Energy Transition Will Make Big Winners Out of Certain Commodities: Vanadium Will Be One of Them.** 

Even though certain developed countries already generate up to half of their energy needs from renewables, the supply chains to fuel the creation of those same energy sources look the same as they did 50 or 100 years ago.

The materials that powered a world running on oil, gas and coal will not be the same ones powering our solar panels and wind turbines. The new world order requires two things above all, energy storage and energy efficiency. Vanadium, and by extension Largo is poised to enable both. 

**The Market Doesn‚Äôt Yet Appreciate Accelerating Vanadium Demand** 

[Vanadium Demand by Sector](https://preview.redd.it/x1088qvrkg7a1.png?width=240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba3d44253c7e4b3c18fab3072deac37e4a5ac62d)

Pricing for Vanadium is expected to remain strong into the future as supply has not been ramping up fast enough to meet increasing demand.

As the word‚Äôs only pure play vanadium miner, Largo offers investors a differentiated way to invest in the developing movement towards lessening global carbon emissions.  Largo sells both standard grade and high purity vanadium pentoxide products around the world.

Standard grade VPURE‚Ñ¢ vanadium pentoxide flakes which can be converted into ferrovanadium for the steel industry.  VPURE+‚Ñ¢ vanadium pentoxide flakes and powder used in the production of master alloys for aerospace applications and chemical/catalyst applications VPURE+‚Ñ¢ vanadium trioxide powder for aerospace and chemical/catalyst applications. 

Vanadium Redox Flow Battery VCHARGE with patented technology and substantial IP portfolio Ideally suited for long duration energy storage applications over 6 hours.  The company recently launched Largo Physical Vanadium (TSX.V:VAND) which acts as an independent financial intermediary and will own the vanadium needed in Largo‚Äôs VRFBs ‚Äì essentially eliminating the cost of vanadium in VRFBs (represents a 40-50% cost reduction).

The company recently expanded into the pigments business and will use existing feedstock from its vanadium operations to enhance margins. The company expects to begin producing ilmenite concentrate in Q3 2023 and expects to begin full production of titanium dioxide beginning in 2025. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Largo is a two pillar business model](https://preview.redd.it/yx4i2ebpog7a1.png?width=497&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00a756d0d235af434b781f1d9801d3f4ba55febe)

**When it Comes to Mining Vanadium, Largo is the 800 Pound Gorilla**

Largo‚Äôs production capacity is \~11,000 - 13,000 tonnes of V2O5 annually, a full 50% of all primary

vanadium mine capacity globally.

 **Largo‚Äôs Two Pillar Business Model**  

Pillar 1 Vanadium for Energy Efficient Manufacturing 

 Vanadium‚Äôs ability to make steel and other materials both lighter and stronger has always made it a key component in the global construction industry. However, with the signing of the Paris Agreement to decrease CO2  emissions, government pressure increased on all industries to step up to the challenge. It‚Äôs hard to overstate how important the construction industry is to global emissions.  

 About 22.5% of global steel production is used in reinforcement bars (rebar) for the construction industry with the UN estimating the energy consumption of buildings account for 30% to 40% of all global energy demand.  

https://preview.redd.it/kt5s30b1rg7a1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59140eed308dfdf7711c27c46cafc9a1a01fc6c2

 Building Codes Could Drive a 7x Increase in Vanadium Demand 

 China is waking up to the benefits of vanadium reinforced steel and demand intensity for both China and other emerging markets will converge with the higher usage of developed markets over time. North American steel has twice the vanadium content of Chinese steel. China, a major source of demand for vanadium, recently toughened steel rebar quality standards increasing the minimum vanadium content requirement to .03-.10%. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Pillar 2 Vanadium for Battery Storage 

 As global experts in the chemical properties of vanadium, Largo has quickly identified promising future uses of Vanadium beyond construction. The most promising near term revenue opportunity for Largo is the Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB). A VRFB is a type of flow battery based on technology with decades of research, testing and development behind it.

 **Largo is Creating Entirely New Demand Markets with the Launch of Largo Physical Vanadium Corp. (LPV)** 

What we like most about the management team at Largo is that they are not content to hope demand and pricing play out like the forecasts. They are aggressively building new sources of demand and new ways for investors to gain exposure to vanadium.

**Enter Largo Physical Vanadium Corp. (LPV).**

Largo Physical Vanadium (TSX.V:VAND) is a publicly traded holding company that exclusively buys and holds physical vanadium.  For the first time, through LPV, an investor can gain direct exposure to vanadium. LPV works very similarly to the wildly popular Sprott Physical Uranium Trust but with a few twists.

LPV is a genius move by the Largo team as it increases demand for vanadium, drives adoption of VRFB

batteries and raises public awareness of the significant environmental benefits of the metal.

The establishment of LPV benefits Largo in a few ways:

1. Reduces cost of VRFBs for Largo‚Äôs potential VRFB customers by removing the cost of vanadium from

the system as LPV is only charging a token fee for use of the vanadium in the battery electrolyte which

offsets management fees for LPV

2. Increase in demand for vanadium should benefit Largo‚Äôs top line in the future.

3. Continues Largo‚Äôs focus on ESG-aligned strategies while using vanadium in batteries 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ogqu7bk4tg7a1.png?width=563&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f19c4c7a16b746cd0dcc6d0810dd49c88ade9d4c

LPV started trading on the TSX-V exchange September 30th under the ticker VAND.V and currently holds 690,000 kilograms of vanadium. 

 **Largo Offers Production Growth and 20 Years of Reserves** 

Not only does Largo produce 7% of the world‚Äôs vanadium supply, it also has room to grow production capacity and sustain it for decades. 

High prices and free cashflow are nothing if the resource under the ground won‚Äôt sustain it.  If the world‚Äôs need for vanadium grows as strongly as forecasts expect over the next decade, investors and customers will be scrambling to lock down high quality and long lasting supplies of vanadium.

Largo is the only pure play vanadium miner with high purity capacity available today, the ability to increase production to meet surging demand and the resources to supply production for decades to come.

 **Largo Trades at a Large Discount to the Value of the Mining Assets with the Other Businesses Essentially for Free** 

 The management team at Largo is expecting strong year after year growth in LOM cashflow as Vanadium‚Äôs role grows more important to companies meeting global emissions targets. In 2021, consultancy GE21 ran an economic analysis showing Largo is expected to produce $4.0 billion of free cash flow over the life of mine at an approximate vanadium price of $8.50/lb. This exceeds Largo‚Äôs entire current market cap of \~C$489 million by 10x. 

GE21 also found that Largo‚Äôs vanadium mine alone has a C$2 billion after tax net present value, 4x higher than the companies current trading value. Not to mention the NPV analysis excludes Largo‚Äôs energy business which has significant potential on its own. According to RBC Capital Markets estimates, Largo‚Äôs cleantech business could be worth $190 million meaning investors are buying the vanadium mining business for only $300 million, or 1.7x 2023 EBITDA estimates.

# [Stock futures are muted after Wall Street‚Äôs rally on Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/21/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were muted in early trading on Thursday, as traders digested a sharp rally from the previous session.
*****
&gt; Stock futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Averages fell 79 points or 0.23%. S&amp;P 500 futures declined 0.25%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.34% lower.
*****
&gt; CarMax shares dropped more than 12% in the premarket after the used car retailer missed profit and revenue expectations. Micron Technology shares slipped 3% in the premarket on disappointing quarterly results. Under Armour shares shifted between gains and losses after the athletics apparel maker selected Marriott executive Stephanie Linnartz as its next CEO.
*****
&gt; The moves followed another positive session for stocks. On Wednesday, the Dow gained 526.74 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite surged 1.49% and 1.54%, respectively.
*****
&gt; All 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished the day with gains, led to the upside by energy. Nike and FedEx shares rose on quarterly results, giving some investors hope that earnings are faring decently despite concerns of a downturn. Strong consumer sentiment data for December also gave markets a lift.
*****
&gt; While better earnings results likely factored into the upbeat market sentiment Wednesday, oversold conditions may have contributed to the rally, according to Liz Ann Sonders, Charles Schwab‚Äôs chief investment strategist.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think there were a couple of earnings reports that came out that were marginally better than expected,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I also think that the market has been in another corrective phase, and, on some technical measures, got a bit oversold. Buyers stepped in. The wiggles on a day-to-day basis are hard to put a direct finger on.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Even with Wednesday‚Äôs gains, stocks are on pace to finish the month with losses. The Dow is down 3.51%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have tumbled 4.94% and 6.62%, respectively. All three major averages are slated to break a 3-year win streak and post their worst yearly performance since 2008.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, investors awaited jobless claims data.

Plan: Long around $140.5, stop loss at $138.3, target to $146, risk-reward ratio is 1:2.

Buy at $141.3, stop loss at $140.6, 1 to 1 kick at $141.5. Hold before market close.

Plan: Long around $145, stop loss at $144, target to $148, risk-reward ratio is 1:3.

From the SPX 15 minutes chart, support level is around 3860, resistance level is around 3910. I think it will be a sideways trend today, and it‚Äôs hard to trade. I would like to wait to trade until tomorrow‚Äôs core PCE Price Index result comes out. The expected Christmas rally may not be too good.

The price is extended from 8&amp;21 EMAs, I am expecting a price correction.

On the 15 mins chart, resistance is found around 13.04. This resistance is definitely not as strong as the trend line resistance, but underneath the line there is a small gap between 12.79 and 13.02, and that will possibly hinder the rebound.

Looking through charts, seems like a rebound on going.

 Ronny Yakov, CEO of OLB, said, ""As we previously announced, our Board of Directors has authorized a stock buyback to buy our common stock from time to time as market conditions warrant to reduce our shares outstanding at historically low valuations. Considering OLB's current market cap is only about $13 million with our Year over Year revenue growth approaching 100% to a revenue projection of over $31 million for 2022, Patrick and I have decided to purchase shares personally when permitted as we believe the trading price does not reflect the value of the shares.""

\-Overall, Weekly timeframe $Spx is still making lower highs and lower lows.  Keeps getting stuck at the weekly 50.  All of this indicates a retest of $3491.58 or lower by setting another minor low.  If you follow indicators closely, MacD is also bearish.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Daily MAcD also Monday just went negative for first time in recent.  TTM squeeze's is firing to the downside. (Chart)

&amp;#x200B;

\-Today mostly stuck in accumulation phase after initial move.  Channeled at $3890-$3870.  Could potentially play the above below those levels . Calls/Puts.

&amp;#x200B;

Isn't it great!!! .. .. .. . No.  Didn't think so.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Isn't that how they do it. lol.  Critical thinking always. If you want to want success then figure out how to get there on your own through the means provided by your surrounding.  It could be as simple as googling something unknown to find the answers.  GURUS and courses are not needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Remember also,  success is not just what is in the bank, it is balance in self mastery that leads to a lifetime of success through what your going through today .

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**: Price pierced into the gap-window, then stalled, and failed to close above Friday's red canble at 386.58 -- if price does not get above this leave, a bear flag may be forming. Next resistance 389.63 gap fill -- with 394.30 and 399.40 gap window/fill as significant resistance. If bears return, 380.54 to 378.28 is immediate support, with more solid support at 374.13 gap-fill and a decade-old TL around 365.

**QQQ:** Price bounced right to its former support TL, then stalled, and failed to close above Monday's red candle at 373.96 -- if price does not get above this level, a bear flag may be forming. If price can ge above that TL it should hit moderate resistance at 280.72 where its previous bullish consolidation broke down -- then 282.25 to 286.51 are gap window/fill.  If bears return, 268.49 to 266.95 is immediate support, with more solid support at 263.32 gap-fill, then it will hit major support between 260.85 to 261.21 the COVID-low TL.

**IWM:** Price pierced the 175.68 gap-fill, pulled back, but did manage to close above Monday's red canble at 175.05 -- the most 'bullish' action of the majors, and as a leaing indicator, suggests there may be more upside in the market.  Next resistance is 178.03 gap-window, with more moderate resistance at 180.19 gap-fill; major resistance remains between 186.40 to 185.95 with converging TLs. If bears return, weak support begins at 174.45 gap-window, with 172.92 offering slightly more support.  More moderate support at 171.18 pivot low, with 167.78 to 167.55 being a major level.

I executed 2x trades today

Trade:  OPEN  
Type:  LONG  
Stock:  TSLA  
Price:  136.00  
Size:  0.5%  
Thesis:  Filled a major gap from November 2020.  I only took a 0.5% position because of how volatile TSLA has been given all that is going on between Elon &amp; TWTR; I will add another 0.5% at 132, the pivot low immediately prior to the aforementioned gap-up.  My first target is $165

Trade:  OPEN  
Type:  SHORT  
Stock:  ACGL  
Price:  63.10  
Size:  0.5%  
Thesis:  Pierce of a major resistance trend line.  I only took a 0.5% position because today is Day #2 of the current move and at least one more up-day is highly likely, especially if the broader markets continue to bounce.  I will add another 0.5% if price hits 65.00 tomorrow, followed by another 1% if price moves directly to $68.  My first target for covering is the $55 gap window.

I'm trying to figure out what the best market to trade the s&amp;p is, to grow a small account, that would allow me to risk as little as possible for the same gain and still make a usable amount of money to compound the account. I was trying to decide between forex (SPX500), futures (MES), or equities (SPY or a cheaper etf). For this example say it's a \~1-2k account.

1. Assuming I was consistent with a chosen strategy, does one market over the other allow you to risk less for the same gain, and have better profit potential with? (easier/faster to scale a small account with). If so, what is the reason? ex. leverage?, just how the buying/selling is designed?

2. Which of the two would be easier to learn between forex and futures? (I'm already familiar with equities)

3. Would the gains even be worth it to trade equities (or fractional shares) for SPY (or a \~$40 priced spy etf) with a 1-2k account?

**SAN DIEGO, Dec. 21, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --** **KULR Technology Group, Inc.** **(NYSE American: KULR) (the ""Company"" or ""KULR""), a leading energy management platform company accelerating the global transition to a sustainable electrification economy, today announced that it has entered into a six-figure annual subscription agreement with an industry leading, American-based commercial helicopter operator (the ‚ÄúClient‚Äù) to provide global track and balance support for its fleet of helicopters via** **KULR VIBE****, which provides a proprietary AI-driven vibration reduction solution. By incorporating KULR VIBE into their maintenance program, the Client can safely service and maintain operations of its diverse helicopter fleet which service customers in the oil and gas and air-medical sectors.**  


**The Client is one of the world's largest civilian helicopter operators with over 250 diverse aircraft spanning 5 continents.**

**Through KULR VIBE, the Company addresses one of the most challenging issues with advanced machinery today, excessive vibrations. Vibrations cause increased maintenance, accelerated component replacements, and downtime. Excessive energy-robbing vibrations are destructive to both the helicopter and in many cases the operator. By integrating KULR VIBE into its existing hardware and software processes, the Client can pinpoint areas where excess vibrations across its fleet of 250+ helicopters may cause system malfunctions, weakened performance, maintenance issues, and loss of available aircraft to perform its mission. With KULR VIBE and the 24/7/365 maintenance support it provides, the Client can keep its fleet of helicopters, that would otherwise be grounded or pose a substantial risk to crew members airborne. KULR‚Äôs Mechanical Fault Diagnostic (""MFD"") software compliments the learning algorithms and AI functions of KULR VIBE to provide a comprehensive solution for the end customer.**

**‚ÄúKULR has a long history of developing products that offer its customers proven solutions built to safely withstand the most severe conditions, from space to extreme heat, while also mitigating the potentially devastating effects of excessive vibration on machinery,‚Äù said KULR‚Äôs President &amp; COO, Keith Cochran. ‚ÄúThrough our KULR VIBE solution we enable this Client to provide high-quality support to their customers and ensure they can safely carry out some of the most challenging assignments in aviation.‚Äù**

**This recent contract comes on the heels of KULR VIBE's platform** **identifying and remedying** **vibration problems on two Bell AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters and one Bell Boeing Osprey V-22 tiltrotor aircraft at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in southern California. The almost $40 million AH-1Z Viper Attack Helicopter was previously diagnosed as inoperable before KULR's team quickly identified, resolved, and facilitated a return of the aircraft to mission capable status.**

**KULR is currently working with a helicopter retrofit company to embed its systems in older aircraft while focusing on a key market of original equipment manufacturers who may wish to install KULR VIBE as factory equipment. The Company‚Äôs immediate focus is two-fold: grow the commercial helicopter business and integrate with the United States Department of Defense to help enable their fleet for flight readiness 24/7/365.**  
**In addition to helicopters, the Company sees applications for KULR VIBE in eVTOL aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems, high-performance automobiles, renewable wind energy turbines and industrial motors.**

**According to Fact.MR, an insights-driven global market intelligence company, the global vibration motor market** **is estimated** **at USD 6.5 Billion in 2022 and is forecast to reach USD 24.1 Billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 14.1% during 2022-2032.**",NYSE: KULR Provides Client‚Äôs Global Fleet of Helicopters with Mission-Critical Maintenance Support,1671638718

# [Dow futures jump more than 300 points, boosted by Nike shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose on Wednesday after earnings reports from two major bellwethers raised hopes that corporate earnings may be better than feared even with a possible recession on the horizon.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 340 points, or 1%. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.6%.
*****
&gt; Nike shares added 12% after the apparel maker beat Wall Street‚Äôs expectations for quarterly earnings and revenue. FedEx gained 4.7% even as it fell short of revenue expectations. The package delivery giant beat consensus earnings per share estimates on per-share.
*****
&gt; With the end of 2022 in close sight, all three major averages are on pace to post their worst yearly performance since 2008 and break a 3-year win streak. As of Tuesday‚Äôs close, the Dow was down 9.6%. For the month, it‚Äôs toppled about 5%. The S&amp;P is down 19.82% for the year and more than 6% for December, while the Nasdaq‚Äôs plummeted 32.58% in 2022 and about 8% this month.
*****
&gt; Wednesday‚Äôs moves followed a day of slight gains for stocks. The major indexes snapped a four-day losing streak, putting a little wind back into hopes for an end-of-year rally.
*****
&gt; The modest gains came even after the Bank of Japan moved to widen its cap on the 10-year Japanese government bond yield, leading to a spike in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield higher that initially rattled traders.
*****
&gt; There are a few more big names left to report earnings before the Christmas holiday, with Micron reporting after the bell.

**This isn't financial advice. Never rush into investments. Always take your time to do your own DD before investing.** 

The last couple of days we got confirmation. Several uranium transactions were made above an uranium price of 60 USD/lb, even Encore Energy announced a small uranium transaction at 70.50 USD/lb yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

**EnCore Energy:**

Indeed, based on the global uranium production cost curve analysis vs the global uranium demand, uranium transactions around 80 USD/lb will eventually occure in the near future. It's just a matter of time.

Today physical uranium can be bought through Sprott Physical Uranium Trust at an uranium price of only \~42.50 USD/lb (= U.UN share price 14.60 CAD/share), while transactions are occurring now above 60USD/lb and even already 70USD/lb

Plan: Long around $128.5, stop loss at $127, target to $133, risk-reward ratio is 1:3.

Buy at $127.5, stop loss at $127, 1 to 1 kick at $128.2. Sell some position at $129.2, and then hold before market close.

It‚Äôs a good choice when open at $127.5, risk is $0.5, but you can reward $2.5.

In a Bloomberg monthly survey of 38 economists, the probability of a recession in 2023 is estimated to be 70%. The median estimate of GDP growth is about 0.3% next year. Economists also estimate an annualized 0.7% DECLINE in the second quarter and flat readings in first and third quarters. 

Payrolls are expected to decline in second and third quarter, unemployment rate expected to peak at an average of 4.9% by the first quarter of 2024. Private investment including spending on equipment and structures are expected to fall 3% in the first three quarters of 2023. Industrial production is estimated a 0.7% decline on average in 2023.

The Senate aims to pass the bill by Thursday, to then have it signed by the President on Friday, giving the public and law makers little to no time to review it. It seems rushed and secretive. 

Based on what I have read the expenditures are as follows:

‚ÅÉ	$45 billion to help support Ukraine
‚ÅÉ	$38 billion in emergency funding to help Americans (natural disasters) 
‚ÅÉ	$2.6 billion for US Attorneys
‚ÅÉ	$11.3 billion to the FBI
‚ÅÉ	$39 billion for the Justice Department 
‚ÅÉ	$119 billion for veterans' medical care
‚ÅÉ	$53 billion to support critical services and housing assistance for veterans and their families.
‚ÅÉ	$5 billion for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund
‚ÅÉ	$8 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant (aids low income family‚Äôs with child care)
‚ÅÉ	$12 billion for the Head Start Program (aids children in low income families prepare for school)
‚ÅÉ	$5 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
‚ÅÉ	$576 million for the Environmental Protection Agency
‚ÅÉ	$132 million for the Capitol Police
‚ÅÉ	$3.6 billion for homeless assistance grants
‚ÅÉ	$6.4 billion to the Community Development Block Grant formula program
‚ÅÉ	$1.5 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program ( will build 10,000 new rental and homebuyer units)
‚ÅÉ	$4 billion to Navy's shipbuilding budget
‚ÅÉ	$8.5 billion to buy F-35 fighter jets and $2.5 billion to buy Boeing's new KC-46 tankers
‚ÅÉ	$1 billion to help developing countries expand their renewable energy efforts
‚ÅÉ	$950 million for Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop drugs to combat pandemics
‚ÅÉ	$965 million to the Strategic National Stockpile, (Nation's medical reserve)
‚ÅÉ	$770 million for federal law enforcement grants issued to local governments
‚ÅÉ	A pledge that the United States will deliver $11.4 billion annually by 2024 to help developing nations tackle climate change

Bill also includes proposals that could greatly affect Medicaid's eligibility and a ban on TikTok from devices used by federal agencies and military branches.

* This number is by no means extreme lately, as the œÉ (1 std deviation) of quarterly equity rebalancing flows over the last 3 years is \~$50bn

Note is brief, but they bring up some points about key assumptions which can impact the estimate. The relevant parts are below.

1. BNPL buy now pay later will explode initially but defaults will continue to rise causing mass defaults into middle of next year setting off a chain reaction already happening in car repossessions, revolving credit debt , and lines of credit. Securitization is larger than market knows and tranches will default as well

2. Buckingham palace will be stormed and the UK will vote to either go back into EU or the economy will suffer its largest contraction recession in decades and mass protests

3. New BOJ head (April) will shift policy and the JBG market will explode to 1% causing major losses to the bank and BOJ will be forced to sell ETF holdings and bonds onto market to defend , selling the equities can take over 100 years hit a big chunk will happen next year. Long YEN all year, short Nikkei

3. Macron will be forced out of office in France and a shift in party will take shape.

4. Italy will become more brazen and cause a lot of headaches for EU in 2023, which PIGS countries will undergo austerity measures or vote to leave EU or simply cause another European debt crisis

5. Mexico will be one of the best performing economies next year with AMLOs nationalization of lotion deposits and oil refineries and more friendly towards cattle agreements to not allow Canadian and Asian countries to plunder resources. Maybe even restructuring nafta agreement 

6. US unemployment will rise to mid 5s next year causing a surprise in data and consumers pairing back significantly in retail and e-commerce spending 



7. Credit Susie will be bought out or restructured causing a banking crisis short term for European banks

8. Gold wll see $3000 price tag per oz


9. Agriculture and farming will be overhauled with continued investment in agri automation and smart farms as farmers are being forced out and gov takes a more central role in our food supply. Also influencers and media will talk up insect protein and bugs eating more and more, beyond meat 3.0 


10. Price controls on commodities will hit in ferrous metals and some agri commodities next year 

11. China will roar back and have a breakout year in 2023 as true reopening and investment is till being underpriced

Some of these are wild and less than 3% Chance of happening but they don‚Äôt fall it tail risk or black swan investing if it wasn‚Äôt

3461,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**: Slight relief today. The fact it came on light volume, and more from a time-perspective than a technical level, suggests only neutral to positive bias for tomorrow's price action.

 

**SPY**: Barely retraced back into yesterday's candle. If upside continues, first resistance is 385.18 and 389.63 gap window/fill -- with 394.30 and 399.40 gap window/fill as significant resistance.  For the bulls to regain control, the failed-breakout descending TL must be broken around 405.  If selling resumes tomorrow, modest support should come at 374.13 gap-fill, followed by a decade-old ascending TL around 365 until hitting major support at the 357.70 COVID-low TL.

https://preview.redd.it/vep4llcva47a1.jpg?width=2301&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29fe828043d1cd56974190571f45946f9ac3711a

**QQQ:** Price failed to close within yesterday's candle, but at least it did not validate the breakdown of its ascending TL. If upside continues, first resistance will be that ascending at TL 273.90 -- followed 280.72 where its previous bullish consolidation broke down -- then 282.25 to 286.51 are gap window/fill.  Similar to SPY, major resistance remains around 295 the pivot high TL.  If selling resumes tomorrow, first support is at 263.32 gap-fill, then it will hit major support between 260.85 to 261.21 the COVID-low TL.

**IWM:** The most solid retrace by any major, but on the least amount of volume.  If upside continues, first resistance will be gap-fills at 175.68 and 180.19 with major resistance between 186.40 to 185.95 at a confluence of descending TLs.  If selling resumes tomorrow, first support is 167.78 pre-COVID pivot high with major support  between 167.55 to 167.75 the COVID-low TL.

My question comes from an example our teacher gave us in class, where he said someone who invests in dental care products and dairy products would have a more diversified portfolio than someone who invests in dental care products and candy, and he said that ""when you make money on one side, you don't on the other"" and I'm extremely confused.

Do you ever wonder why ***every*** stock market message board has someone in there that is posting about short squeezes? This is the only reason anyone ever buys a stock. They all dream that a $10 stock will suddenly jump to $100...and if you own it, that would make you rich quick! And Wall Street gives you this show every now and then just to make you feel bad that you weren't in it. Wall Street will figure out first where retailers are not, and then they will make that stock soar. Yep, they want to make sure you don't get rich on MSFT or DIS or UBER or UAL or anything else you may actually own. They will soar a stock such as GSKEJS or TFGSJ from $0.79 to $8.52. And CNBC will make sure you know about this obscure stock! THIS is what keeps you in the FRAUD market. The hope that one of yours will perform like this nonsense equities nobody's heard of.

Nobody will ever buy stocks if they saw them going down. So Wall Street has no choice but to throw a bone every now and then to keep people interested in the stock market. And there will never be a shortage of the con artists who will post justifications for buying. These people are most likely sellers, but want you to think they are buying. Be careful! You might get hooked and start pumping for them! For free, to boot!

As an investor, I have been highly interested in the precious metals market for the past couple of years. Having followed the history of money - particularly gold - I have been deeply impressed. As such, I recently began researching Aris Mining, a holding in a junior mining ETF. What I have discovered is that Aris Mining is an exceptional company that both operates its own properties and actively looks for new exploration opportunities.

**Exploration Project**

The Juby Project is an advanced exploration-stage gold project located in Ontario, Canada, 100 kilometres south-southeast of the Timmins gold camp. It is situated within the Shining Tree area in the southern part of the Abitibi greenstone belt, and is owned by GoldON Resources Ltd. The Project covers an area of 180.4 square kilometres and is comprised of 13 mining claims and one patented mining claim. The Juby Project has the potential to host multiple gold deposits, and has recently seen the completion of a positive Preliminary Economic Assessment, indicating a financially robust gold mine.

The Juby Project has excellent access to infrastructure including a major highway, a power transmission line that passes through the property, and an abundance of water in the region. The regional geological setting at Juby is similar to that of the Kirkland Lake and Timmins gold camps and is largely underexplored.

**Dividend History**

The most impressive part of Aris' books is its dividend history. As of this moment, the company has a forward dividend yield of 5.26% at $0.18 per share, which is higher than all of its previous dividends of $0.15. This increase in dividend yield is especially remarkable considering the current economic turmoil. This solid dividend performance speaks volumes about the soundness of Aris' financials and its ability to manage risk. This is a testament to the company's commitment to providing long-term value to its shareholders.

**Operating Mines**

***Segovia***

The Segovia Operations are located 180 kilometres northeast of Medell√≠n in the Segovia-Remedios mining district of Antioquia, Colombia. Segovia is a multi-million-ounce high-grade gold operation that has been producing gold for more than 150 years. The area is rich in gold deposits, and Segovia has been able to take advantage of this natural resource to create a successful and long-running business. The company is committed to responsible mining practices, and works to minimise its environmental impact. Segovia is a major contributor to the local economy, and provides employment for many people in the area.

***Marmato***

The Marmato gold district has been mined since pre-Colonial times by the Quimbaya people. The gold resource was so significant that Simon Bolivar, the revolutionary leader who liberated much of South America from Spanish rule, used the gold as collateral with British banks to secure funding for his war efforts. In more recent times, the Marmato gold district has been extensively mined by large-scale commercial operations, and is currently estimated to contain over $20 billion worth of gold reserves.

**Final Thoughts**

To be clear, I don't have any shares in Aris, but that might change in the future the way this company is headed. There are so many good aspects its hard to find any negative ones. They have producer that's creating an insane profit margin that's essentially 50% while spending capital on developing and exploring other sites. I can't wait to see what happens when they get the others online as well.

3515,StockMarket,"I feel this could be a good buy point of KDP. Looking at the chart, KDP is obviously a sideways in medium terms, the price is at the bottom of the sideways channel. Additionally, the price is overextended from 8 and 21 EMA, so a price correction is needed. A rebound happened yesterday, but not enough to complete the price correction. I am expecting a further rebound for today.

  I found a weekly basis support around 35.5, and a daily basis resistance at around 36.21. Last Friday‚Äôs trade just tested the weekly basis support and price got pushed up later, so this support is still effective. On 15 mins chart, KDP went beyond and fell back to the daily basis support, and then the support did its job to hold the price. This to me is a signal that the daily basis support is working, but the power of this support needs more information to justify. With that said, I believe it's still a technically low point to entry in this sideways pattern of KDP.

3542,StockMarket,"Hello All,

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to write this post for a couple reasons and would love to hear input from the Vol and equity crowd. As I am sure you have seen on TWTR countless graphs superimposing 08s SP500 and VIX chart to 2022 there's supposedly going to be an impending spike in VIX and selloff in equities within 2-3 months. Now this may happen but let's see why this is likely not going to happen in the short term (1mth)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Showing the correlation coefficient between 08/22 graphs ) and looking at the charts fintwit loves to redraw their lines to make it seem like the pattern of price action between these two markets (VIX/SP500) is direct and almost 1.0 correlation is laughable. Digging through the data if anyone does basic research can show that right now corCoef is less than .70. Secondly, they can't explain why is it the price action doesn't compute when it was q1/q2 of this year to early 08 doesn't even correlate to less than .50 only that because prices are getting tighter NOW is when it's starting to line up. This is false. 

2. Open interest and new positions on VIX the last couple days. So I saw on Twitter today all these breaking news handles showing big OI positions being opened in the JAN 30 VIX calls - where someone purchased a block position of 27109call contracts ($2.81mm) and think this is a catalyst of someone knows something pending going to happen. This also appeared in the Jul 75calls 10,000 ($820,000) and in other calls ranging out to March over 6mm notational. 

This is RETAIL!!

How do I know, well, as a firm that strictly trades asymetric vol and tail events, retail always does this shit near market ST bottoms. Why? Because they have been seeing their long only portfolios go down and instead of being institutional building a position in smaller chunks to not give away their position and become overly concentrated in one chain, they always buy BLOCKS all at once. Institutional does not do this. The cost to insure on VIX right now is high going out to 50 calls and anything higher than that, is a long shot less than 0.03% of occurannce for payout so Retail always buys these 'protection hedges' without realizing or understanding their greeks. They just think I have several million in a long only potfolio and will purchase what I percive is cheap insurance and not look elsewhere. 

Institutional was buying protection when value and options pricing was cheapest in the last quarter and this was last week of November and in doing it in smaller chunks. And insitutional knew that this was also high so buying protection on SOFR, CDS, calls on JPY or CHF was a better play than outright VIX action. 

So why should we care and what does this all mean. The block orders coming in on VIX right now on egregious call prices is hedging on long only, not understanding their payoffs, and those who are going to be trapped selling back these options at much lower prices in the comping 2-14 days. Now that they have bot all these call options and exposed themselves in a certain chain, guys like us or others who spot this abnormal volume will supress prices and sell more calls to these individuals and will see their options level off or theta kicks in. The market is oversold at these levels, and yes could we have a major correction? Of course. But it wont be this week or even next week. 

&amp;#x200B;

The rant or wisdom however you want to take it is when you see big OI positions take place in stupid prices of VIX way OTM or ATM for less than 60days happen, usually the market is near a bottom at least short term before retesting older resistance levels at higher prices on SP500. If we revisit this post this time this week, the market will be say 4-5% higher, and those options chains will be much lower with forced selling because now they dominate the majority of the OI and they have to sell it back to those not willing to pay a 30% premium to where prices should be given options models. 

&amp;#x200B;

So when you see more posts on TWTR this week talking about the superimposed SP500 and VIX mimicking 08 and a combination of big orders hitting VIX in BLOCKS, This is retail and not insitutional and retail is usually wrong in spots like this.

Dear XXXXX,  


Today, we took an important step toward our goal of returning assets to clients through our chapter 11 cases. It is our belief that clients unambiguously own the digital assets in their BlockFi Wallet Accounts. As such, we filed a motion requesting authority from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to allow clients to withdraw digital assets that are held in their BlockFi Wallet Accounts. We will be seeking similar relief from the Supreme Court of Bermuda with respect to BlockFi Wallet Accounts held at BlockFi International Ltd. This motion does not impact withdrawals or transfers from BlockFi Interest Accounts, which remain paused at this time.  


In order to facilitate withdrawals from BlockFi Wallet Accounts, we also requested permission to update the User Interface to properly reflect transactions as of the platform pause on November 10, 2022 at 8:15 p.m. (prevailing Eastern Time). This is a necessary step towards ensuring all clients are treated fairly and that the User Interface properly reflects the digital assets in Wallet Accounts as of the pause so BlockFi can honor all withdrawal requests from Wallet Accounts properly if authorized by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and, with respect to BlockFi International Ltd., the Supreme Court of Bermuda.  


While filing this motion is an initial step, we will continue to work towards solutions that maximize value for all clients and other stakeholders and will share updates as quickly as practicable.  


We are looking forward to discussing this motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and key parties in our cases, and expeditiously moving towards a path that returns Wallet Accounts assets to clients. We expect that our request will be heard by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court at our hearing currently scheduled for January 9, 2023, at 10:00am ET. We expect that our request for similar relief with respect to BlockFi International Ltd. will be first heard before the Supreme Court of Bermuda at our hearing currently scheduled for January 13, 2023 at 10:30am AST and then scheduled for a full hearing after that on a date to be fixed.  


Additional information regarding our chapter 11 cases, including court documents and claim information, can be found by visiting BlockFi‚Äôs claims agent Kroll at https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/blockfi.Clients with questions about the process may call Kroll at (888) 773-0375 (Toll Free) or (646) 440-4371 (International), or email blockfiinfo@ra.kroll.com

3545,StockMarket,,How the World‚Äôs Central Banks Orchestrated the Coming Recession,1671499365
3546,StockMarket,"Many people might be confused and horrified to see the market falling, falling, falling. The JPow said that the terminal rate would go (slightly) higher than expected previously, and that the Fed would hold interest rates at the terminal rate throughout 2023. Just that catalyst has triggered days of red across the major indexes, with little sign of abating. Why is this happening?

Market participants, primarily institutions, are forward-looking. They're not reacting to what's happening right now, but to what they expect will happen three to six months from now. Essentially, prices are moving down as if the recession and other bad events were already happening *right now*. What we're seeing is insane.

Consider the current prices of three companies and their pandemic lows:

    AMZN: $84.92/share v. $81.33/share. 
    PYPL: $68.95/share v. $82.38/share. 
    VZ: $37.03/share v. $48.97/share.

The bad news is already happening, long before a real recession, *in anticipation* of that recession. I have no idea how low prices will go, or over what period of time. But I can reasonably predict that the nose will pull up *before* macroeconomic conditions start to improve. (This could be years away, though.) 

Going forward, what should we expect?

By the end of H1 2023, the Fed will have done whatever it's going to do, and all of that will finally, *finally*, well and truly have been priced *in*. The problem is that what it will have done will have led to lots of people being fired. Corporate earnings will drop. Guidance will weaken. Share prices will drift downward, on the whole. This ""deep freeze"" is what will bring inflation under control. 

There will, however, be other problems. Our economy runs on credit. We buy lots of things using our credit cards. We buy cars on credit. We take out mortgage loans to buy houses. The Fed is removing credit from the market. Because people don't want to pay a fortune in interest, they'll defer major purchases as much as they can. Being afraid of losing their jobs will also inhibit large purchases. 

Most companies run on credit, even if they have positive cash flow. They're always trying to grow and expand, which they finance through debt (i.e. borrowing money). In these restrictive economic conditions, it will cost them a lot more in interest to secure loans, and the size of the loans will be smaller than they were able to secure before, due to credit risk. 

Taken together, there's no place for share prices to go *but* down over time. I suspect that SPY will drop meaningfully (e.g. at least 10.00%) in 2023, although flatlining for a protracted period of time is also possible. I also expect the CPI to continue to decrease, but the cost for achieving that isn't clear yet. Expect growing personal and corporate bankruptcies and loan defaults, lower corporate earnings, weakening guidance, and lower share prices in 2023. 

When will the market truly bottom?

It could happen in the summer of 2023, or two years later. No one knows because no matter which macroeconomic data you look at, there are too many ambiguities and unpredictable variables to be able to make any conclusion, such as the course of the Ukraine war, whether the EU will find itself in a devastating recession (this is relevant because it's such a huge trading partner of ours), and the price of oil (energy prices are a key input into every economy). We also can't forget about the evolution of the pandemic virus and the ongoing risks and problems that it creates world-wide. 

My own impression is that the market conditions are going to be bad for a long time. Everywhere we turn, we find bad news.

If this is true, what can we do?

I'm doing two things. 

First, when prices become unrealistically cheap (look at PLTR, for instance), I'm shorting a large number of puts at even more unrealistic striking prices. Those who don't trade options can start DCA'ing (slowly). If you're afraid of growth stocks, consider TMUS or VZ, which should prove resilient in a recession because people aren't going to cancel their cell phone plans. Those companies' cash flows are secure, and you can also benefit from dividend payments. 

Second, I'm very carefully making explicit bearish bets, such as a *Long Put Spread* on MDB, which is currently profitable and will hopefully become more so over the coming weeks. It's very dangerous to make bearish bets in a bear market (ironically) because of the risk of a sudden and violent relief rally. But there's also something to be said for not fighting the trend, and the trend has been down, down, down.

I'm a pretty good trader. (I booked $100k in a period of nine days in 2020, for example.) In a bear market, I feel lucky to book $1,000 in a month from trading. It's just too dangerous to scale substantially into plays, no matter which strategy you use, because bear markets are characterized by high volatility, which means that your win rate is going to drop substantially, and because you have to bet a lot of money to make just a little money, even a single loss can cause a large drawdown. 

The only way for us to get through this nightmare is to be very patient, and understand that it's not going to end in 2023, which is going to be a bad year. Eventually, new market leaders will emerge. We don't need the market to regain all-time highs anytime soon. We just need it to be stable to make money. We're a long way away from that point.

Finally‚ÄîI'm sorry for the welter of bad tidings‚Äîconsider SPY, going back fifteen years. Draw a trend line through it. Whether looking at that trend line, or the Buffett Indicator, we can see that the market is overvalued and can reasonably infer that it has to drop. The conditions are unfortunately ripe to cause it to do just that.

Hunker down for the long haul. My long-term guess is that even though things are pretty bad for us, they're much worse for other countries. Everything in the Money Game is relative. Although I don't know when things will stabilize, let alone reverse, I believe that when they *do* reverse, America will lead the world.

And *we* will go on to make a killing!

Hang in there, everyone.

**QQQ:** The potential ascending TL using Friday's low did not hold, suggesting price is headed to the next support level at 263.32 gap-fill. If this level breaks, major support is between 260.70 to 261.21 the COVID-low TL.

3565,StockMarket," [Bureau of Labor Statistics Press Release](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/24/2022-17994/updating-spending-weights-annually-based-on-a-single-calendar-year-of-data) \- *Effective with the February 2023 release of CPI data for January 2023, BLS will update weights annually for the Consumer Price Index based on a single calendar year of data, using consumer expenditure data from 2021. This change impacts the CPI for urban consumers (CPI-U), wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W), initial and interim versions of the Chained CPI-U, and CPI research series. This reflects a change from prior practice of updating weights biennially using two years of expenditure data. This shift will result in changes to some documents available from CPI, including the CPI Relative Importance tables Report and CPI Handbook of Methods.*

**I've been exchanging emails with an economist at the BLS and here is what I've gotten back from him.**

*The overall methodology will be basically the same. The main change will be that weights will be based on more recent data. For example, historically we had two years of data (e.g. 2019-2020) that had to be updated to the December pivot month (e.g. December 2021) by the change from the average index value in 2019-2020 to the index value in December 2021. Now, with the January 2023 update, it will be 2021 data updated to the December 2022 pivot month by the change from the average index value in 2021 to the December 2022 index value. As for how it will impact CPI and core CPI, obviously any differences in weight allocations will translate in differences in the impact of various categories on overall inflation, but we can‚Äôt make any predictions at this point.*

Essentially, the previous method would have used 2019-2020 weight data, updated by price change and now it will be 2021 weight data, updated by price change. He wouldn't discuss how this could possibly change the CPI and Core CPI numbers but I will probably be looking to close out any positions prior to this print as I think there could be a serious rug pull in the same way that healthcare calculations changed in October.

If you look back at my previous posts you'll see that I'm not optimistic about the future performance of the market but my conspiracy brain is telling me there is a greater than zero chance that they'll try to inflict maximum damage over the next 2.5 months, there will be another clear leg down as the 5% terminal rate gets digested by the market and the Q1 2023 earnings disappoint and then when the February CPI prints and it shows a dramatic drop the Fed will back off their current hawkish projections SLIGHTLY as they are still not going to want to dramatically ease financial conditions. At least that's what I'm thinking now and I'll be looking to close as many positions as I can at a profit before this release because it's going to be a major wildcard.",Bull/Bear Warning: February 2023 CPI Print WILL BE A WILDCARD,1671477170

Elon Musk‚Äôs chaotic tenure running Twitter has already drawn scrutiny from an array of international government officials, who have professed concern about his changes to content moderation, including the suspension of several journalists, and new restrictions on promoting rival social networks. (The Musk management style was again on display after his followers voted to give him the boot as the Twitter C.E.O. in a poll he ran overnight; more on the latest head-snapping developments later.)

Now, DealBook is first to report, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, is taking aim at an issue with more serious potential legal consequences: whether Mr. Musk has created a series of conflicts of interest with and misappropriation of resources from Tesla, the electric carmaker he also runs.

*‚ÄúAs you know, it is the legal obligation of Tesla‚Äôs board to ensure that its C.E.O. is meeting all his legal responsibilities and serving as an effective leader,‚Äù Ms. Warren wrote in a letter to Robyn Denholm, Tesla‚Äôs chairwoman, on Sunday night. (Ms. Denholm did not respond to a request for comment.) While the chaos at Twitter isn‚Äôt Tesla‚Äôs concern, Ms. Warren raised the possibility that many of Mr. Musk‚Äôs actions may be shortchanging Tesla.*

Ms. Warren asked whether Mr. Musk‚Äôs diverting of resources from Tesla ‚Äî including software engineers and senior executives ‚Äî is harming the carmaker. In her letter, the senator also questioned whether Mr. Musk‚Äôs assertion that their being seconded to Twitter was purely voluntary, citing an anonymous employee who told CNBC, ‚Äúmost would also feel it was impossible to turn down a direct request from Mr. Musk without later facing poor performance reviews or other consequences.‚Äù

Ms. Warren also suggested the possibility of Mr. Musk **intentionally shortchanging either Twitter or Tesla to benefit the other**, including Twitter potentially overcharging Tesla for ads or tweaking the social network‚Äôs algorithms to benefit the carmaker. She also asked the board whether content appearing on Twitter under Mr. Musk‚Äôs new content moderation, including a rise in misinformation and what the senator said was hate speech, could end up hurting Tesla‚Äôs reputation.

Besides, if he actually quitted his CEO job of Twitter, it‚Äôs probably good news for TSLA as more focuses are shifted to TSLA. Anyway, I am neither holding any TSLA related position, nor a fan of Elon, just want to see how this drama ends.

**KEY POINTS**

* **Louise Abbott, a partner at law firm Keystone Law, told CNBC the exchange‚Äôs demise is ‚Äúdevastating for investors.‚Äù**

&amp;#x200B;

The collapse of FTX, once a $32 billion crypto exchange, has shattered investor confidence in cryptocurrencies. Market players are trying to gauge the extent of damage it has caused ‚Äî and how it will reshape the industry in the years to come.

Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX‚Äôs former boss who stepped down on Nov. 11, was arrested in the Bahamas last week. He has been charged by the U.S. government with wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering.

FTX connected buyers and sellers of digital currencies like bitcoin, as well as derivatives. However, the company did more than that, allegedly dipping into client accounts to make risky trades through its sister firm Alameda Research.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hugely disappointing for investors, or more so devastating for investors,‚Äù said Louise Abbott, a partner at law firm Keystone Law who specializing in crypto-asset recovery and fraud.

It‚Äôs clear the FTX drama could radically reshape crypto in the years to come. Here are three big ways the industry could change.

## 1. Regulation

For one, the disaster will looks certain to stir regulators into action.

Crypto as an industry is still largely unregulated, meaning investors don‚Äôt have the same protections they would have placing their funds with a licensed bank or broker.

That may be about to change. Governments in the U.S., European Union and the U.K. are taking steps to clean up the market.

The EU‚Äôs Markets in Crypto-Assets is the most comprehensive regulatory framework to date. It aims to reduce the risks for consumers buying crypto, making exchanges liable if they lose investors‚Äô assets.

But MICA is not due to start until 12 months from now. Keystone Law‚Äôs Abbott said it‚Äôs important that regulators act quickly.

‚ÄúPeople need to see that there‚Äôs steps being taken to regulate it. And I think If we are able to offer some regulation, we will build confidence,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs no regulation, the investors are left without that protection that they need.‚Äù

The saga has set back adoption of crypto assets by ‚Äúone or two years,‚Äù according to Evgeny Gaevoy, founder and CEO of crypto market maker Wintermute.

‚ÄúEverything that failed this year, if you look at Celsius, Three Arrows, FTX now ‚Äî all those guys were taking the worst of both worlds because they were not completely decentralized, and they were not properly centralized either,‚Äù he said.

For Kevin de Patoul, CEO of crypto market maker Wintermute, the biggest lesson from FTX‚Äôs bankruptcy is that ‚Äúyou cannot have complete centralization and lack of oversight.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are evolving to a world where you are going to have both centralization and decentralization,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen you do have that centralization, you need to have proper oversight and a proper balance of power.‚Äù

## 2. Consolidation

Many new companies and projects emerged in the years that followed the 2018 crypto winter ‚Äî FTX among them. The expectation now is that fewer firms and coins will exist in the years to come.

Contagion from the FTX saga is already playing out.

Crypto lender BlockFi, which earlier sought financial assistance from FTX, has entered bankruptcy. Now, attention is turning to other trading and lending firms, like Gemini and Genesis.

‚ÄúThe challenge for the whole space when you think about contagion is that FTX and Alameda were extremely active investors in this space,‚Äù Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain.com, said in a CNBC-moderated talk at a crypto conference in London.

Near Foundation, which is behind a blockchain network called Near, was among the firms that took investment from FTX. Marieke Flament, Near‚Äôs CEO, said the firm had limited exposure to FTX ‚Äî though the collapse was still ‚Äúa surprise and a shock.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think all the dominoes have fallen out from the contagion,‚Äù Flament said. ‚ÄúThe impact that this will have is that a lot of projects actually are not going to have the funds, and therefore the resources, for them to continue and develop.‚Äù

Fears have risen over the financial health of other major crypto exchanges after FTX‚Äôs failure. Since early 2020, about 900,000 bitcoins have flowed out of exchanges, according to data from CryptoQuant.

Binance, the world‚Äôs largest exchange, is facing questions about the reserves it holds to backstop customer funds. The company saw billions of dollars in outflows in the past week.

Currently, there is no reason to suspect Binance faces any risk of bankruptcy. But exchanges like Binance and Coinbase face a bleak market backdrop ahead amid falling trading volumes and account balances.

Experts believe they‚Äôll continue to play a role ‚Äî though their survival will be determined by how seriously they take risk management, governance and regulation.¬†

‚ÄúThere will be exchanges that are doing things the right way and that will survive,‚Äù said Abbott.

As for tokens ‚Äî bitcoin, being the longest-living digital currency, may be better positioned than its smaller rivals.

‚ÄúMy bet would be that bitcoin and DeFi \[decentralized finance\] are decoupled from the rest of crypto and actually start to have a life of its own,‚Äù Gaevoy from Wintermute told CNBC.

## 3. Innovation

Despite the depressed state of crypto markets, and the toll it‚Äôs taken on investors, the digital asset industry is likely to pull through.

Proponents of ‚ÄúWeb3,‚Äù a hypothetical blockchain-based internet, expect 2022‚Ä≤s crypto winter to pave the way for more innovative uses of blockchain, rather than the speculative uses crypto is associated with today.

‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing a lot is companies having digital innovation arms or metaverse innovation arms,‚Äù Flament said. ‚ÄúThey understand that the technology is here. It‚Äôs not going to go away.‚Äù

NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, could alter users‚Äô relationships with properties in games and events, for example. These are digital assets that track ownership of unique virtual items on the blockchain.

‚ÄúDigital assets will be an increasing part of our lives, whether that is a collectible, a ticket, value, identity,‚Äù Ian Rogers, chief experience officer at crypto wallet firm Ledger, told CNBC. ‚ÄúIdentity could be membership ... \[people\] using NFTs they own to get access to a particular event or something like that.‚Äù

But for many, there‚Äôs still a learning curve to overcome. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard creating wallets and storing keys and going through different platforms,‚Äù Cordel Robbin-Coker, CEO of mobile games firm Carry1st, told CNBC at the Slush startup conference in Helsinki, Finland.

Robbin-Coker compared Web3 today with the internet in the early 90s. ‚ÄúIt was clunky. You had dial-up, it took four minutes to get on, the original web browsers were not very intuitive,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really the early adopters that really engage at that stage. But over time, companies build smoother interfaces. And they cut steps out of it.""",The FTX disaster has set back crypto by ‚Äòyears‚Äô ‚Äî here are 3 ways it could reshape the industry,1671422896

So, as stated for last 6 months keep an eye on the fed watch-tool.  ""[CMEgroup.com](https://CMEgroup.com)"", Keep an eye on March23 and May23.  That 5% peak level is key and secondarily how long we are going to hold that before a cut. Refer to ""CME group Chart"".

Second, price definitively broke down when Friday closed below what had been bullish consolidation within the micro trend.  The sharp move down which started on Tuesday and continued to Friday puts price extended on the shorter time frame. We could see a small bounce at any point between Monday to Wednesday. This bounce could occur off the next support level at 374.13, or 363.54 - 362.17 as  moderate support.  Major support this week is at the ascending TL from the COVID low: 357.43 (Monday) to 358.14 (Friday).  When the bounce comes, upside will be limited. 389.63 and 399.40 are both gap fills from the most recent move.  Major resistance this week is from that aforementioned descending TL: 405.61 (Monday) to 404.35 (Friday).

**QQQ:**   Both macro &amp; micro trends are now bearish; however, there is slightly more bullish sentiment if Friday's low does in fact create an ascending trend line on the micro timeframe. The sharp move down which started on Tuesday and continued to Friday puts price extended on the shorter time frame. We could see a small bounce at any point between Monday to Wednesday. The next moderate support level is 263.32 gap-fill. Major support this week is at the ascending TL from the COVID low: 260.70 (Monday) to 261.21 (Friday). When the bounce comes, upside will be limited: 282.25 and 286.51 are the gap window &amp; fill from the most recent move.

By comparison, there are less technical indicators here as price hit gap-fill at Friday's low. Next moderate support is 167.78 -- former pivot high just prior to COVID. Major support is coming into this same level from the COVID low: 167.31 (Monday) to 167.75 (Friday). When the bounce comes, upside will be limited: there is an immediate gap-fill at 175.68 and another at 180.19 from the most recent move.

1) In a bear market like these days, most stocks just keep dropping for no fundamental reason. It‚Äôs just emotions and market pressure. If you‚Äôre short or have puts, you‚Äôll make money.

2) In a bull market, when some stock jumps say 40% because of a good earning or good news, usually within a few days all that gain is wiped out and if anything it goes below what it was before the news. So at the end, with some patience, again shorts win.

While calls / buying shares can hypothetically be profitable, it is designed for the hedge funds and big investors (billion dollars) and tends to fail if your account is couple thousand or hundred of thousands or even a million.

So in summary, I believe that general public should only short or buy puts at any given time. This is not an investment advice obviously but I hope that general public can make more money to survive this crazy inflation.

3649,StockMarket," Learning about how stocks work here so please bear with me. From what I learned so far, I know that stocks are a way of basically fundraising a lot of capital that they can use to fund business operations to grow and become more profitable. And this is why many companies will opt to go public instead of solely running on private VC backing.

But what about after all the outstanding shares are bought up and the stock begins trading on a secondary market such as the NYSE/NASDAQ exchanges? How does this activity affect the company and its business performance?  
Now I'm specifically asking about how the performance of the stock's price in a secondary market affects the company, if at all, and not the other way around of how the company's performance affects the stock price.  
I know that in terms of how a company affects its stock price, it's mainly driven by supply and demand, and on a deeper level that supply and demand is impacted greatly by large institutional investors and analysts that analyze the fundamentals of a company to determine its intrinsic value vs. it's market value to see if its price is a justified one.

But what about in the cases where a stock's price drastically changes maybe due to market manipulation and hype, which has little to nothing to do with a company's performance? Such as Gamestop? I knew it blew up like crazy due to the hype, but how did that affect the company and its operations? I imagine that it did nothing to the company right? Because after all the stocks of a company gets bought up, that's it, they achieved their fundraising objective and however those shares are resold in a secondary market exchange is the individual investor's business, unless it does something like issue out more stocks, right?  
So I'm assuming that in the case of, Gamestop, that crazy stock performance did nothing for the company in general and their business operations continued as normal, and it merely left the company a hot topic to talk about among the media, investors, and the board of directors.

Sorry if my line of questioning is a bit scattered, it's just how I'm trying to organize my thoughts and confusion while typing this out. But hopefully, my understanding is somewhat correct and my questions make sense haha. Thanks in advance.",How does a stock's performance in a secondary market affect the company??,1671329453

3668,StockMarket,"Green Giant Inc. (NASDAQ: GGE), a provider of green energy solutions, has been relatively flat since December,in a trend of consolidation at a high level. Both the long and short sides seem to be deadlocked and the stock price lacks directions. However, from a technical perspective, GGE released positive signals at the end of November, forming a golden crossing of the moving average.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lp0kzd4iwh6a1.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc834e222ec282a68dd4f0d819a794d8ded63c98

The ""golden crossing"" of the moving average means that the rising short-term moving average crosses the rising long-term moving average from bottom to top. At this time, the pressure line is broken up, indicating that the stock price will continue to rise and the market is optimistic about it.

GGE's cross between the 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average at the end of November is the golden cross of the moving average, which is also one of the positive signals valued by technical analysts. Therefore, from the technical point of view, GGE is in the consolidation trend, but the overall trend is still bullish. I even think that this stock has the potential to soar in the future. Why?

First of all, GGE is a small cap stock with a market value of less than US $150 million and only 22.47 million float shares, and small cap stocks usually have the potential to soar. GGE's surge ability in early October has already shown us. In only three trading days, GGE's share price rose from a low of $0.66 to a high of $2.82, with a return of 327%.

In view of the small cap characteristics of GGE, I believe that once GGE has good news, its share price is expected to rise, bringing amazing returns to shareholders.

The following are several incentives that may drive GGE's price: broad prospects of green energy, favorable policies on green energy in the United States, and GGE's business progress.",GGE releases positive signals technically with soaring potential,1671299764

3673,StockMarket,"We have been saving up some money for about 2 years now since my wife got pregnant with our first child (born last year). We are planning to have another child next year and would like to start investing some of our savings into something that would generate passive income for us when we retire (20 years from now). I have been doing some research on the internet and came across a few sites. I was hoping that someone could help me out with some advice as to which of these platforms would be best for us to invest in early start-ups. My wife and I are both in our 40(s) and have a combined income of around $90,000 per year.

I've done some research on [EquityZen](https://equityzen.com/) and I'm not sure if it's the right place to invest. This platform is very expensive and way beyond my league since I have to be making around $200,000 a year before I can invest here.

I'm looking into [Hedonova](https://www.hedonova.io/investments/startups) because they were able to offer me a lower rate than [Fundrise](https://fundrise.com/). However, I'm not sure if this is the right place to invest our money either.

3687,StockMarket,"As always, this in not financial advice. This is simply a public reflection of my thoughts on the year as it relates to my portfolio. Due your own due diligence and don‚Äôt trust the words of a random stranger on the internet.

This year I will likely end the year with a return -30% to -40%, currently down about 35%. As I have done (not on reddit) for several years now, I like to reflect on the quality of my decisions and the outcomes.

Entering 2022 I had the following holdings: GOOGL, AXP, BRKB, CHE, CHWY, CNSWF, DPZ, HIFS, LMND, MSFT, SPGI, SCI, TMX, TSLA, TOITF, U, YETI

During the year, I made the mistake of moving aggressively into beaten down low-quality tech. Names like U, LMND, PLTR, UPST, DDOG, OKTA, SHOP, TEAM, TOST. In terms of the quality of the decisions I would say that I was that I did not make complete well-rounded decisions. On one hand, I generally applaud myself for buying companies when they are out of favor. These names were down 40 to 60% at the time of purchase. Where I did not do well was look at more than factors other than torrid growth rate and a bright future fed to me on the beautiful pages embedded on their investor presentations (let‚Äôs look at that and avoid the skeletons in the 10-Q I said to myself). These companies were bought with too much sunshine and not enough rain.

I should have reviewed additional factors:

First, how are the financials trending other than growth. Sure, revenue was going up gangbusters, what about margins, or dilution or capital requirements, Revenue/EE, Revenue/Sh etc. As I dug under the hood later in the year most of these companies made no advancement on margins despite torrid revenue growth. I realized not digging this far was very very stupid.

Additionally, I realized throughout time the competitive landscape has changed and I need to update my assessment as well. Take DataDog. My belief about their competitive positioning was ‚Äúdue to the nature of their mission critical software companies are not likely to leave them due to the high switching costs.‚Äù One day I went over my portfolio holding by holding and I realized that I had virtually all software names that had an advantage in my view that stemmed from a switching cost. It kind of hit me this is ridiculous. How can every company have a switching cost advantage? The cloud changed everything. Without the need for servers, it is much easier to simply move from one company to another. Now of course there are still training costs and implementation costs to be sure, but the barriers to create software have never been lower and the number of options has never been higher.

The realization that switching costs in my opinion is not stringent enough of a definition led me to investigate competitive advantages further. As I do often when I feel I have lost my way in investing, I revisit some legendary texts. This time, I revisited Terry Smith‚Äôs Owner‚Äôs Manual ([https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf](https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf)). In there, he has a section where he speaks about the types of companies they like. Here is what it said:

‚ÄúWe seek to invest in businesses whose assets are intangible and difficult to replicate

It may seem counter-intuitive to seek businesses which do not rely upon tangible assets, but bear with us. The businesses we seek to invest in do something very unusual: they break the rule of mean reversion that states returns must revert to the average as new capital is attracted to business activities earning super-normal returns.

They can do this because their most important assets are not physical assets, which can be replicated by anyone with access to capital, but intangible assets, which can be very difficult to replicate, no matter how much capital a competitor is willing to spend. Moreover, it‚Äôs hard for companies to replicate these intangible assets using borrowed funds, as banks tend to favor the (often illusory) comfort of tangible collateral. This means that the business does not suffer from economically irrational (or at least innumerate) competitors when credit is freely available.‚Äù

This section gave me an epiphany! To sum it up, businesses with competitive advantages are built in a way that capital alone is unable to reproduce. In other words, there has to be an intangible factor that capital is unable to recreate. I combined this idea with the other questions I typically ask myself.

¬∑ **Company Soundness**

o Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

¬∑ **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is their evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

o Is their evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

o What is the competitive advantage?

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

¬∑ **Growth**

o Is their a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

¬∑ **Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

Answering these questions brought down a watchlist of \~75 names to 26.

This filter took names like Amazon off my list. In my opinion, Amazon derives most of its advantage from a long recurring investment in capital. Distribution centers for their retail business and data centers for AWS. Over time as firms have invested in DTC, this has marginalized much of Amazon‚Äôs advantage. Additionally, as more cloud players come into the space, the investment in data centers is becoming more common. Ironically, my opinion on Amazon is add odds with Terry Smith given his position in Amazon. As they say, that is what makes a market. Just pull up annual return on assets and you will see one of the reasons why Amazon is plummeting.

Below is my refined list of 26 companies and why I feel capital alone will be able to replicate them sorted alphabetically by name.

Company Ticker Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB Network Effect for Airbnb's. Customers want to shop for Airbnb's where the hosts are. Host want to list where the customers are.

American Express Company AXP Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

Apple Inc. AAPL Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want phones where they can access the services they customarily use. The Duopoly has been attacked by Microsoft and Amazon, yet we still only have two phone systems.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B Reputation. BRK's reputation has a financial powerhouse makes its insurance division one of the few insurers that can be trusted with large and complex risks. Additionally, management unique operating structure allows for very little conglomerate penalty due to the individual management of many businesses.

BlackRock, Inc. BLK Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history with Blackrock and iShares it will be difficult to upset these funds

Blackstone Inc. BX Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history across many alternatives it is difficult to select a smaller player.

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F Decentralized operating culture. Management acquires small niche vertically integrated software providers. Their capital allocation is uniquely pushed down to distant levels fromtop management which allows them to scale acquisitions on a decentralized basis. This extremely unique management approach is not something money can buy.

Costco Wholesale Corporation COST Low-Cost Provider. By selling items virtually at cost along with leveraging negotiating powers to drive lowest prices Costco has cemented a foothold in retail. All this value is captured in their annual membership fee.

CRA International, Inc. CRAI Reputation. Within Business consulting, CRAI has a reputation for solving large complex solutions across many industries. When a consultant work with 78 of the fortune 100, you know that paying high fees for results is worth it.

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD Network Effect. CRWD's cloud-based cybersecurity solutions and massive customer base allows for quick handling of threats. As one threat is dealt with, the solutions are synced through the rest of their cloud-based service. This means helping one client helps all and the more customers the strong the service.

Fair Isaac Corporation FICO Regulatory Entrenchment and track record. The FICO score is synonymous with personal lending. Often it is a key determinant for determining loan eligibility. Given its efficient track record at quantifying risk, newer options will be behind as they don't have the track record.

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS Culture of Discipline. There are many banks in this world, virtually none of them are as efficient as HIFS. Their disciplined culture toward underwriting leads to lower than industry average charge offs annually while their focus on costs leads to above industry profitability. If you could re-create this with capital, banks with more scale would have similar returns.

IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. IDXX Trade Secrets. IDXX offers many proprietary tests for vets. This means that only IDXX labs can process them. Additionally, many vets are trained on their tests meaning switching would result in the need for new training.

Lemonade, Inc. LMND Potential to be low-Cost provider and culture of customer care. By offering insurance DTC, Lemonade can avoid many entrenched costs from agency model. Additionally, by getting Guinness World Records for fastest claim paid and removing the frustrating part of insurance which is using it, they have the potential to earn pricing power over time

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU Network Effect. In Latin America they are the leading provider of a P2P payment system (like Venmo). They have captured sizeable portions of the populations in Brazil, Mexico and Columbia.

RLI Corp. RLI Disciplined Underwriting culture and unique track record. Their underwriting culture had led to a 10 BPs lower combined ratio and lower ratio every year for the last decade. Money can't buy discipline. They insure a broad spectrum of odd risks. These are both not easily replicated but offer great diversification in their operations.

Rollins, Inc. ROL Low-Cost Provider. As the largest player in most of their markets, Rollin's benefits from major scale advantages. More contracts allow for pest control people to have greater route density during a day and therefore greater profits as well as negotiate better terms on inputs. This is something that a competitor is unable to solve by throwing money at it. Additionally with high brand awareness with Orkin man, they have a step up on smaller lesser-known players.

Roper Technologies, Inc. ROP Decentralized operating culture focused on end markets that benefit from efficient scale. Efficient scale is when an end market is logically only served by one player in a small area, like a freelance truck distributor. If you are looking for a delivery truck, it makes sense that one website would be best for that.

S&amp;P Global Inc. SPGI Regulatory Entrenchment and Track Record. S&amp;Ps credit rating are required by many contracts and regulations for many debt deals. If you need money and your bank requires it, you‚Äôre going to pay a hefty fee for their rating. Additionally, they own the IP for the S&amp;P and Dow Jones indexes. These long track records will never be replaced due to their entrenchment and first mover advantage.

Salesforce, Inc. CRM Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Salesforce is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

ServiceNow, Inc. NOW Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. ServiceNow is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

Shopify Inc. SHOP Network effect. For eCommerce players that are looking to compete independently from the likes of Amazon, Shopify is their lifeblood. This means that App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Smaller player and late entries like BigCommerce have struggled to gain traction

Tesla, Inc. TSLA Network effect, Brand, Unique Operating Culture in a tough industry. Network effects stem from outsized number of cars on road all outfitted with self-driving equipment giving Tesla more data to develop self-driving cars giving them a data advantage for developing self-driving cars. Additionally, Tesla is the undisputed electric vehicle king given their first mover advantage. Finally, they operate differently than most of their competitors. They build the important and unique components in house whereas legacy auto tends to outsource all parts and simply assemble them. They sell DTC at retail prices whereas legacy auto sell wholesale to dealers. They have a standard labor force whereas most of legacy auto has unionized labor which is trained on legacy ICE engines. The auto industry is historically difficult to enter as it requires large amounts of capital, high fixed costs with a cyclical product.

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN You can't re-create the limited supply of mountains in the world. There are so many mountains and locations with the proper weather conditions to enable skiing. This gives them pricing power, particularly when you account for how many mountains they own in many regions.

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN Government granted monopoly. All .com and .net domains must be registered with VRSN. Additionally, price increases are regulated. Fortunately, ROCs are not

Visa Inc. V Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

From there I reviewed the 26 companies by valuation and felt 15 of them are compelling investments at this time:

Company Ticker Target

Visa Inc. V 10.00%

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B 10.00%

Blackstone Inc. BX 8.00%

American Express Company AXP 8.00%

Salesforce, Inc. CRM 8.00%

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F 8.00%

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS 6.00%

Tesla, Inc. TSLA 6.00%

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN 6.00%

Lemonade, Inc. LMND 5.00%

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU 5.00%

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB 5.00%

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN 5.00%

Shopify Inc. SHOP 5.00%

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD 5.00%

I feel much more confident in the portfolio after re-reviewing the soundness, ability to be replicated, future growth prospects. They key for future years is to avoid laziness when analyzing names. It is foolhardy and expensive to fall in love with an investor presentation and then go and buy it on hopes and dreams rather than seeing the larger picture.

The ironic thing is I have owned 14 of the 15 at some point in my life. For one reason or another I got shaken out of them and bought into the temptress that goes by the name of high growth. Like most temptresses, more research reveals not much substance.

For next steps, I will work on integrating the above process into my stock review routine and stick to it. I find that the hardest part with investing is simply sticking to a practical approach. Its too easy to waver to something new. Variety is the spice of life, but makes for the taste of cocoa powder in investments.

*****
&gt; Stocks dropped Friday, building on their year-end sell-off, as fears grow over a recession taking place as the Federal Reserve continues raising rates.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 281.76 points, or 0.85%, to 32,920.46. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.11% to 3,852.36. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 0.97% to 10,705.41.
*****
&gt; The indexes notched a second consecutive week of losses. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.08% for the week, and putting its December losses at 5.58%, as hopes for a year-end rally fizzle. The Dow and Nasdaq slid 1.7% and 2.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Trading was especially volatile Friday with a large amount of options expiring. There were $2.6 trillion worth of index options expiring, the highest amount ‚Äúrelative to the size of the equity market in nearly two years,‚Äù according to Goldman Sachs. At session lows, the Dow was down as much as 547.63 points, before paring back some of those losses.
*****
&gt; The sell-off was broad-based, with three stocks falling for every advancer at the New York Stock Exchange. At one point, there were only 10 S&amp;P 500 names in positive territory. The real estate and consumer discretionary sectors were the biggest laggards, down nearly 3% and 1.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Stocks fell this week in the wake of the Fed‚Äôs 50 basis point interest rate hike on Wednesday ‚Äî the highest rate in 15 years. The central bank said it would continue hiking rates through 2023 to 5.1%, a larger figure than previously expected.
*****
&gt; Following the policy update, the Dow dropped 142 points on Wednesday, plunged 764 points Thursday, and declined further on Friday.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúAt the beginning of the week, we had the hope, given the very soft CPI number, that we could expect the Fed, and maybe the other central banks of the world, to be less hawkish,‚Äù Bokeh Capital founder Kim Forrest said.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúBut because they didn‚Äôt, and they had some stern words for investors and consumers alike that they were really focused on getting inflation down quickly, that has taken away a lot of our hope for a soft landing,‚Äù Forrest added.

&gt; # Santa Claus Rally, Mid-December Low &amp; January Indicator Trifecta

&gt; Wall Street, MSM and social are abuzz with Santa Claus Rally chatter and hype this week, but everyone has it all wrong. I can see Yale‚Äôs big grin shining down on us as his famous indicator and catchphrase reverberate on The Street.

&gt; They argue their case for why the ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù will or won‚Äôt come to town this year. But they miss the point. Yale Hirsch invented and named the Santa Claus Rally in 1972, published in the 1973 Almanac. Oh lord, it is still misunderstood. It‚Äôs not a trading strategy, it‚Äôs an indicator!

&gt; SCR is the short, sweet rally that runs from the last 5 trading days of the year to the first two trading days of the New Year. S&amp;P 500 posts an average gain of 1.3%. Failure to rally tends to precede bear markets or times when stocks could be purchased at lower prices later in the year.

&gt; To wit Yale‚Äôs famous line: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come To Broad And Wall.‚Äù (Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac 2023 p 118).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c6285b39d656e4d47a2825774f0ebca7/14d8e7b82ba5eca8-a9/s500x750/c2684ec719407200da72d1e590a56cbc11015917.jpg))**

&gt; The current situation is reminiscent of 1974. Midterm October low, December retest. Lots of dire news and conditions. The Fed is clearly done taking orders from Wall Street and Washington and is bent on halting inflation. Their quarterly dot plot ticked up and it looks like at least one more 50bps hike. It‚Äôs working, inflation is decelerating. Reality is we will have higher inflation and rates for a while.

&gt; But we have already been in a bear and likely a recession. Bear markets bottom before recessions end and bull markets start when The Street least expects and practically everyone is a bear right now. While it sure looks ugly out there, we contend the worst is behind and a nascent bull is trying to emerge.

&gt; Stocks tend to bottom here in mid-December ahead of the seasonally strong last half of the month, especially small caps ‚Äì what used to be the ‚ÄúJanuary Effect.‚Äù

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/abe551038af905961dbe224f3309291b/14d8e7b82ba5eca8-dd/s500x750/bf884d42dce190a9e6386a7bab4025a8131b2f8d.jpg))**

&gt; The results of the Santa Claus Rally along with the other two components of our ‚ÄúJanuary Indicator Trifecta,‚Äù the first five days of January and the full month January Barometer (also created by Yale Hirsch in 1972) will help solidify our outlook for next year.

&gt; When all three are up the S&amp;P 500 has been up 90% of the time, 28 of 31 years, with an average gain of 17.5%. When any of them are down the year‚Äôs results are reduced and when all three are down the S&amp;P was down 3 of 8 years with an average loss of -3.6% with bear markets in 1969 (-11.4%), 2000 (-10.1%) and 2008 (-38.5%), flat years in 1956 (2.6%), 1978 (1.1%) and 2005 (3.0%). Down Trifecta‚Äôs were followed by gains in 1982 (14.8%) and 2016 (9.5%).

&gt; Keep your eye on the SCR for signs of a new bull or continuing bear. Then watch for the rest of our ‚ÄúJanuary Indicator Trifecta‚Äù FFD and JB. When all 3 agree the market generally follows suit.

&gt; We are anticipating a SCR this year. Inflation is easing, the Fed is likely to be done with rate increases in Q1 and we also see supply chain constraints fading now that China is loosening its Covid-19 restrictions. Seasonally speaking, we are also in the middle of the historically strongest period for stocks, the ‚ÄúSweet Spot of the 4-Year Cycle,‚Äù Q4 of midterm years through Q2 of pre-election year.

&gt; # 5 Things To Know About Recessions And Bear Markets

&gt; ‚ÄúI am an optimist because I don‚Äôt see the point in being anything else.‚Äù Abraham Lincoln

&gt; With all the talk about a pending recession and stocks in a bear market, today, I wanted to share some more thoughts and stats on recessions and bear markets.

&gt; First things first, we do not currently anticipate a recession in 2023, which is quite opposite of the general consensus. You can read more about that here and here.

&gt; What exactly is a bear market? For the definition of a bear market, we are using the traditional definition, which is an index down 20% or more from the recent peak. Yes, there isn‚Äôt much difference between 19.8% and 20.0%, so we will also include some near bear markets as well, but when we say bear market, that is what we mean.

&gt; First, do all bear markets take place in a recession? Turns out they don‚Äôt, as stocks, indeed can have a bear market without a recession. The worst ever was the 34% bear during the Crash of 1987, which all took place without a recession.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-197-800x595.png))**

&gt; Second, taking things a step further, here we broke down the performance based on if the bear market took place in a recession or not. Take note; we did include some ‚Äònear bear markets‚Äô this time to get more instances. Plus, a near bear feels like a bear market if you are in it. What still amazes us about the table below is that the average bear market without a recession was 24%, and this recent bear was 25%. Assuming we avoid a recession and October was indeed low, this was right on the bullseye.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-264-800x361.png))**

&gt; Now take another look at the table above. The last few bear markets recovered quite quickly. In fact, the last three bear markets that didn‚Äôt have a recession recovered in four, four, and three months. Something to think about here, as stocks are two months off the October lows.

&gt; Third, this has been making the rounds lately and has been adding to some of the worries. Looking at all the bear markets that took place around a recession, not once did the bear market end before the recession started. In other words, if we are indeed headed for a recession in 2023, this could suggest that new lows may also be quite likely. Incredibly, bears don‚Äôt end for another nine months on average after the recession started, before they find their ultimate low. Again, we don‚Äôt see a recession, so this wouldn‚Äôt be the case now, but the data is quite compelling.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BearMarketEnds-800x332.png))**

&gt; Fourth, the month of October tends to be a bear-market killer. Most bears have met their end during the month of October, more than any other month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/OctoberEnds-800x338.png))**

&gt; Below, we break down those previous 17 bear (or near bear) markets. The bottom line six of them ended in October, and we think there‚Äôs a very good chance number seven just happened.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-632-800x455.png))**

&gt; Fifth and lastly, if October was indeed the bear market low, be open to the idea of higher prices over the coming two years. While not a predictor of future behavior, history shows the markets were up more than 40% a year off of the bear-market lows and up almost 60% two years off of them. During uncertain and volatile situations (like the ones that markets have treated us to in 2022), it can be hard to imagine a positive path forward, and all we see are the obstacles. Stepping back a bit can be a helpful reminder of the resiliency of the markets over the long term.

&gt; Dr. Seuss said, ‚ÄúSometimes the questions are complicated, and the answers are simple.‚Äù To me, bear markets can be confusing and complicated, but the answer has always been that they indeed do eventually end, and historically better times will come when they do.

&gt; # 2022 US Stock Market Snapshot

&gt; With just a couple more weeks left in the year, the S&amp;P is down 18.2% year-to-date, which is tracking for the worst year since the Financial Crisis in 2008. As shown below, we've seen huge monthly volatility throughout the year within an overall downtrend. If December's declines hold, we'll have seen a move of 3% or more in either direction in eleven of twelve months this year. September has (so far) been the worst month with a decline of 9.3%, while July was the best month with a gain of 9.1%. In terms of weekday performance, Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays have averaged declines this year, while Tuesdays and Wednesdays have averaged small gains.

&gt; # Energy Losing Its Grip

&gt; You know those scenes in the movies where a character finds themselves hanging off a bridge, and slowly their sweaty grip starts to loosen as a finger or two starts to slip? That's what the energy sector is going through right now. As oil prices have been under pressure over the last few months, energy stocks had been holding up relatively well as the S&amp;P 500 Energy sector hit a new cycle high exactly a month ago today. Since then, the sector has declined nearly 9% even as the S&amp;P 500 has moved higher. Last week, the sector broke below its 50-DMA for the first time in over two months before stabilizing this week. Since that break below the 50-DMA on 12/6, the sector has made multiple intraday attempts (including today) to get back above it, but each time the sector has sold off and finished off its intraday highs. When looking at a price chart, any time you see a security break below a key moving average and then make several unsuccessful attempts to get back above that level, it's often a sign of a momentum shift.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/121422-XLE.png))**

&gt; On a relative strength basis, the Energy sector is also toeing a key trendline. The chart below compares the relative strength of XLE to the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) over the last year. During that time, Energy's relative strength has been riding a trendline higher with bounces each time it kissed that level. The most recent example occurred this week, but at this point, the bounce has been meager. Energy stocks have been outperforming energy commodities in recent months, so it's only natural to see some mean reversion in the stocks as well, but with the sector already breaking below its 50-DMA, this is a key trendline to watch. If the sector's relative strength weakens further, the technical picture for the sector would weaken materially, which would be a development investors in just about every other sector wouldn't shed a tear for.

&gt; # The Monetary Policy Conversation is Going to Shift in 2023

&gt; First, the good news ‚Äì

&gt; * The Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate by 50 basis points (bps) to the 4.25-4.50% range ‚Äì a step down from the 75 bps rate hike pace they went with at the last four meetings. This was expected, but it‚Äôs always good to see confirmation.
&gt; * They also said that ‚Äúongoing rate increases will be necessary‚Äù and raised their estimate of the peak rate from 4.6% to 5.1% in 2023, which was not a big surprise. What‚Äôs important is that the end of the rate hike cycle is near. The estimate revisions are nowhere as large as what we had seen earlier this year. At the end of 2021, they estimated rates to peak at 2.1% and then continuously shifted those up by 0.6% ‚Äì 1% increments every three months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-2022-12-14-median-fed-funds-rate-expectation-600x800.png))**

&gt; The not-so-good news: They also provided revised estimates for the economy, which wasn‚Äôt great.

&gt; * They revised economic growth lower, from 1.2% to 0.5% (2023)
&gt; * They revised the unemployment rate higher, from 4.4% to 4.6% (about 1% point higher than where it is now)
&gt; * They revised core inflation higher, from 3.1% to 3.5% (2023)

&gt; While Fed Chair Powell was careful to say that they don‚Äôt believe these forecasts qualify as a recession, keep in mind that the U.S. has never experienced a 1% rise in the unemployment rate outside of a recession.

&gt; But if you notice, I said ‚Äúnot so good news‚Äù instead of ‚Äúbad news.‚Äù Powell pointed out that these are members‚Äô best estimates ‚Äúas of today,‚Äù but that could change as new data comes in. And we have plenty of data coming in. Before their March meeting (when they update the projections again), we have three more inflation reports, three employment reports, and an employment cost index report (which is a preferred gauge of wage growth).

&gt; If you look back at the previous chart, we‚Äôve seen significant shifts in rate expectations just over the course of this year. There‚Äôs no reason to think we won‚Äôt see more revisions if the data cooperates.

&gt; # The shift: From how fast and how high to how long
&gt; The conversation in 2022 revolved around inflation, which surged to the highest level since 1981. As a result, we saw the most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in four decades as the Federal Reserve (Fed) looked to get on top of inflation. The Fed‚Äôs singular focus was to ensure they did more than ‚Äúenough‚Äù to lower inflation. Consequently, the over-arching question on investors‚Äô minds across the year was how quickly the Fed would raise rates, and how high they would go.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-2022-12-14-fed-funds-target-rate-601x800.png))**

&gt; I believe that‚Äôs going to shift in 2023. Fed officials will likely start thinking about balance again: the risk of tightening too much vs. the risk of not doing enough. Powell mentioned this in comments he made a couple of weeks ago but didn‚Äôt mention it again in his post-FOMC meeting press conference. The omission was curious, more so because we just got a second consecutive inflation report that surprised us to the downside. All he said was that, while the report was encouraging, they need substantially more evidence to believe that inflation has turned a corner. And so, they‚Äôll keep rates ‚Äúsufficiently restrictive.‚Äù

&gt; I think it was probably more a matter of Fed officials not having enough time to digest the report and not revising estimates accordingly. But as I wrote, the prospects of softer inflation in 2023 look good. There is enough reason to believe that disinflation will kick in as we get into the backend of 2023, especially if energy prices don‚Äôt spike again and core goods prices continue to ease. Official rental inflation starts to reflect market rents (which are falling rapidly). All of which makes it likely that estimate revisions will happen.

&gt; So, the question for investors will also shift‚Äîfrom how fast and how high to how long and how long they will keep interest rates at an overly restrictive level. The conversation will revolve around how many months of soft inflation data they need to see and how soft it must be. This could obviously take some time since inflation is not going to go down in a straight line ‚Äì there may be fits and starts and false alarms, but the trend is clear.

&gt; # The risk of ‚Äútransitory‚Äù deflation
&gt; What will upset the apple cart is that the disinflation we see in goods prices and housing is deemed transitory by the Fed, and they maintain rates at an overly tight level. This is not an insignificant risk. Powell again mentioned core services inflation, excluding housing in his press conference. He tied it to wage growth and a tight labor market. This group includes personal care services, education, childcare costs, wireless services, insurance fees, etc. ‚Äì all captured in the light blue bar in the chart below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-2022-12-15-core-CPI-576x800.png))**

&gt; As you can see, the good news is that the light blue bar just made its lowest contribution to core inflation in four months. The risk is that the Fed looks past all of this. Instead, they use wage growth and other labor market metrics as their guiding light as they think about ‚Äúhow long to stay restrictive.‚Äù

&gt; I think the odds are weighted in favor of them moving lower once inflation starts to fall rapidly, though only by the end of 2023 at the earliest. Which is not as early and not as big cuts as the market currently expects.

&gt; # Is Anyone Bullish?

&gt; ‚ÄúThe future ain‚Äôt what it used to be.‚Äù Yogi Berra

&gt; We‚Äôve noticed a recent trend: nearly no one is looking for stocks to do much in 2023. As Yogi said many years ago, the future ain‚Äôt looking too good.

&gt; The general consensus is that the first half of next year could be very rough, with many banks and investment shops expecting stocks to go back to new lows. Here‚Äôs a tweet I did summarizing some of the recent calls.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-195-800x364.png))**

&gt; Adding to this, for one of the first times ever, Bloomberg data showed that Wall Street Strategists expect negative returns for the S&amp;P 500 next year. That just doesn‚Äôt happen, or it didn‚Äôt happen until now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-275.jpg))**

&gt; We‚Äôve also noticed a considerable spike in put volume over the past week, another way of showing how potentially worried the masses are currently. Then yesterday, I saw this headline, adding to the festive mood.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-361-800x228.png))**

&gt; Here are two more signs of near-historic levels of skepticism. First, the recent Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey showed a record low level of risk appetite. In other words, lower than the financial crisis and COVID.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-410.png))**

&gt; Second, our friends at TDAmeritrade have proprietary data showing retail investors near the lowest level of sentiment since April 2020. This is called the Investor Movement Index (IMX), which measures what investors are actually doing and how they are positioning in markets. Again, not a lot of excitement out there.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-581-800x523.png))**

&gt; There‚Äôs an old Wall Street adage that it is hard to get hurt falling out of a basement window, and we think that could be the case now. Our take is that an incredible amount of negativity is priced into markets currently, and any good news could continue the recent strength off the October lows. Or, as General Patton said, ‚ÄúIf everyone is thinking alike, somebody isn‚Äôt thinking.‚Äù

&gt; What could spark it? It‚Äôll likely be better trends in inflation, which could open the door for the Fed to turn slightly more dovish. Coupled with what we continue to believe is a healthy and robust consumer, the economy may likely avoid the recession that many are expecting. We discussed better trends in inflation here and here.

&gt; It is hard for us not to keep pointing out that it is extremely rare for stocks to fall two years in a row. The S&amp;P 500 was down two years in a row in ‚Äô73 and ‚Äô74 (one of the worst recessions ever), then three years after the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s, that‚Äôs it. Even during the financial crisis, stocks only fell in 2008 before a significant rebound in 2009.

&gt; As the table below shows, it pays not to drive the car looking at the rearview mirror, as what just happened likely won‚Äôt happen again. As every time stocks fell in a midterm year (likely where we land in 2022), they bounced back the following year each time and gained 25% on average. Now, to be clear, we aren‚Äôt saying stocks will gain 25% next year‚Ä¶ But we are saying it isn‚Äôt as crazy as it sounds.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/table-for-joey-800x375.png))**

&gt; Warren Buffett said, ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.‚Äù Things haven‚Äôt been good for investors this year, but there are many opportunities to plant some trees today and benefit from what we predict to be a surprisingly good year for investors in 2023.

&gt; # VIX Death Cross Historically Bullish for S&amp;P 500 over Next 2 Weeks

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/701d12ab931a8e09d896aca1743b79b8/45d979a75554c1bd-aa/s500x750/84cf1e777c0891ca4ee5224dedf9b08cf23f5650.jpg))**

&gt; On Friday December 9, a Death Cross appeared on a chart of CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). A Death Cross occurs when the 50 day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. When this happens to an individual stock or major index like S&amp;P 500 it is normally considered bearish. But since the VIX is designed to measure near-term market volatility the lower it goes the better the S&amp;P 500 usually performs. Thus, a VIX Death Cross can be a bullish indication.

&gt; Going back to 1990, including the most recent cross, there have been 36 VIX Death Crosses. The S&amp;P 500‚Äôs average performance 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the past 35 VIX Death Crosses have been plotted in the following chart. In the 30 trading days prior to the VIX Death Cross, S&amp;P 500 rose an average of 4.1%. This solid advance is what played a large role in the VIX Death Cross as a rising market is normally accompanied by falling volatility and a declining VIX. After the Death Cross, S&amp;P 500 continued to climb another 2.5% over the next 60 trading days.

&gt; Also included on the chart are the 35 VIX Golden Crosses. A Golden Cross is just the opposite of a Death Cross, the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average as VIX is rising. A VIX Golden Cross is not a good event for S&amp;P 500 as it has typically declined an average 2.4% before the VIX Golden Cross and failed to return to breakeven 60 trading days later.

&gt; In following tables, we present the S&amp;P 500 performance after past VIX Death Crosses and VIX Golden Crosses across various timeframes. Based upon average performance the near-term, 1-and 2-week S&amp;P 500 performance following a VIX Death Cross is better than a VIX Golden Cross, but by 1-month later and beyond the results are less clear. This would suggest that the current VIX Death Cross is likely bullish in the near-term, but not a great indication much beyond 2-weeks.

3710,StockMarket,"
I don‚Äôt understand. In the past 10 years of trading, I‚Äôve never come across an easier market. Just buy daily puts and short SPY and APPL or any other stock you like and you end the day green. There is no way the market will go up anytime soon so we can repeat this process every single day for months to come and keep making money. No analysis needed no DD needed.

3714,StockMarket," As always, this is my plan and I share it to get feedback or help others view the market in new ways. It is not meant as trade advice or ideas. *Note that this uses the futures, which are currently trading at a \~30 point premium to the SPX.* 

***Recap***: Unfortunately for US-based traders like myself, the big move below **3920** happened overnight and we missed the clean trend move. In yesterday‚Äôs plan, I said that *‚Äúlosing support at* ***3920*** *could be grounds for a bigger move down. This would represent a move into value from the week of 11/5/22, and would begin a retrace down the November 10th spike up on a well-received CPI number. Targets are* ***3879*** *and* ***3820***\*.‚Äù\*

The first target hit quickly in the extended hours and after a move up at the cash session open, we got a swift move down to **3879** again. In yesterday‚Äôs analysis section, I wrote that ‚Äúmoving below **3880** would mean that this flag structure has also begun to fail.‚Äù I should have brought this point into the Plan section, but forgot. Luckily, I was still ready to trade and went short there for a quick trade down. With a profitable week already locked in and quad witching today, this was my only trade, and I took very little out of it.

***Balance/Trend***: The market has trended down for the last three days and this could be the start of the next leg down in this market. On the weekly time frame, the market has now booked consecutive weeks down, too.

***Analysis***: The most important thing to note is the big rejection on the weekly chart, which shows a move down from resistance in the core trend channel from January. In the process, this also was a rejection of the 200 day moving average. The second most important structure is the technical break from the trend up since October on the daily chart. The market first broke down from the 200 day last week and back tested it this week, unable to close any days above it. Therefore, the core trend remains decidedly down.

The final thing of note is that the market today found support at **3875-80** before failing there. This is not only important for reasons mentioned above, but also because if the market had held above, it would mean that the bull flag I mentioned back in November was still holding.

***Plan***

* Staying below **3920** is broadly bearish, and this remains a pivot area as indicated yesterday
* If the market can recapture **3877-3880**, the I would be interested in going long, targeting **3915-20**
* If the market can show some strong buying above **3920**, I would also be interested in going long to target **3955-65**. Should there move continued buying above this level, I would add to the long side, targeting **3997**.
* If the market remains below **3871-79**, I am interested in shorts. Ideally, as usual, I‚Äôd like a show of force from sellers as indicated by volatility and volume, and delta too. Markets typically will repair these ‚Äúgaps‚Äù I mentioned, which extends to **3826** and next up would be my target of **3820** mentioned in the plan for today. Final target would be 11/5 weekly vPOC at **3816**.  

   * It‚Äôs hard trading with targets that are too big, but this move could extend quite a ways, and my final target could be as low as **3750**

3724,StockMarket,"An overvalued stock is a company whose value has been elevated beyond that of its fundamentals. There are many possible reasons for this to happen, such as investor optimism, speculation, or a lack of accurate information about the company's true financial health.

Several indicators may reveal that a stock is overvalued. For example, the company might be experiencing a decline in sales or profits, or it might have high levels of debt. Additionally, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share, may be significantly higher than the industry average.

Investors who buy overvalued stocks run the risk of having their shares plummet in value when the market realizes their true worth. Investors should do their homework and thoroughly investigate the company's finances and prospects before making any decisions to buy or sell.

It should also be noted that overvalued stocks can sometimes continue to rise in price for a long time because investors are still optimistic or some other factor is at play. However, this does not necessarily mean that the stock is a good investment, since it may eventually come back down to its true value.

In conclusion, overvalued stocks can be risky investments because they may not be accurately priced based on the company's financials. Before you buy or sell a stock, do your research and think things through carefully.

The FIFA World Cup 2022 gave us some great underdog stories; Saudi Arabia defeating Messi‚Äôs Argentina, Japan bringing Germany to its knees, Ronaldo‚Äôs Portugal getting beaten by Tunisia and Morocco, Brazil getting beaten by Croatia‚Ä¶ and that unpredictability is the beauty of this game.

Like the World Cup, the markets have been a roller coaster ride this year with some less favoured stocks showing resilience and outperformance, like Croatia and Morocco.

Most investors pick stocks like football teams favouring Argentina, Brazil, France or Germany‚Äôs of the stock market- well known and popular. However, it is often the lesser-known ones that surprise everyone with their success. Finding those names is tougher, but often more rewarding.

Some InvestorAi picks include:

¬∑ **Sharda Cropchem Ltd**, in the Materials sector delivered a return of over 50% in the month to 11th Feb 2022

¬∑ **DB Corporation Limited**, in the Communication Services sector, delivered over 26% over a 30-day period to 27th Aug 2022

¬∑ **Karur Vysya Bank Ltd**, in the Financials sector, delivered over 40% returns in the month from 7th July 2022

Underdogs carry greater odds than the mainstream picks, but it‚Äôs harder to find the winners, so in the absence of being lucky, how do you identify them?

Fortunately, for markets, technology and massive amounts of data can help. Our [InvestorAi Equity](https://investorai.co.uk/equity/) app uses AI trained to look for breakout patterns to make investment predictions. As a machine, it lacks the human biases that we all have (like betting on your favorite team) and has the discipline to implement them (recognizing that it‚Äôs hard to come back from being two goals down.) It covers over 4500 global stocks and 1500 ETFs in 15 markets and performs over 800 million calculations every day, something that is impossible for a regular person to do. The proof is that it picked all the winners above and many more.

Whilst we will all be glued to our screens this Sunday eagerly to finally see who wins in the Lusail Stadium, we can‚Äôt wait to see who the surprise standouts of 2026 will be and hope that InvestorAi continues to spot the underdogs with great potential.

3736,StockMarket,"There are several reasons to¬†be bullish on the future of renewable energy industry in the United States: government support, market force, increasing demand, etc. But today, I want to highlight a latest news in technology: it is reported that the scientists with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory produced more energy than was consumed in a fusion reaction for the first time. In an experiment on 5 December, the lab‚Äôs National Ignition Facility (NIF) fusion reactor generated a power output of 3.15 megajoules from a laser power output of 2.05 megajoules ‚Äì a gain of around 150 per cent. However, this is far outweighed by the roughly 300 megajoules drawn from the electrical grid to power the lasers in the first place. This is a significant technology breakthrough in renewable energy ‚Äì maybe energy in general, which might have been changed forever because of this milestone. This is why the mere result of experiment, although have not been applied to any industrial usage, has intrigued global discussion and attention. 

What does it tell retail stock investors? If you‚Äôre sensitive enough to understand the importance of this news, then maybe it‚Äôs time to be bullish on renewable/alternative/clean energy stocks. Institution favorite blue chips and industry leaders are too crowded for retails investors, so it is important to find undiscovered small-cap stock, for example, Green Giant Inc. (GGE). This company came to my attention because of it has just entered the game ‚Äì a new executive is just appointed with a board that came from a real-estate background with enough capital and willingness to spend money and do something. I can‚Äôt help but notice the way they claim to operate in this new industry for them: they cooperate with companies that want to decarbonize and help them achieve that goal by sending experienced experts and technicians. At the same time, they will invest in renewable companies by leveraging financial resources.

Now the stock is basically unnoticed with low volume and very few press coverage. Sometimes it‚Äôs a good sigh when it comes to small caps because retail investors can only beat institutions by finding gems first.","A significant technology breakthrough in renewable energy, arousing public attention to renewable/alternative/clean energy stocks",1671205231

* Trump is launching his own NFT collection.
* The collection counts 45,000 NFTs, which are minted on Polygon and available for $99.
* Directly purchasing the trading cards on the website automatically enlists collectors into a sweepstakes game with thousands of prizes.

The former President of the United States announced on Truth Social the launch of his official digital trading card collection. The collection counts 45,000 NFTs, all of which feature Trump himself in a different attire‚Äîsuperman, spaceman, sheriff, stock market broker, golfer, etc. The President stated in his post that he intended for his fans and followers to view each of his cards ‚Äúvery much like a baseball card, but hopefully much more exciting.‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs NFTs are currently only purchasable for $99 each on his official website, though it shouldn‚Äôt take long for them to pop up on secondary markets such as Blur or OpenSea. The website makes it easy for non-crypto natives to buy the digital cards‚Äîfans only need an email address and a credit card, and the platform creates a crypto wallet for them. It‚Äôs also possible to buy the NFTs using MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet, and pay with wETH.¬†

Purchasers of Trump NFTs are automatically entered in a sweepstakes game, in which more than a thousand prizes will be distributed. Rewards include a dinner with Trump, a cocktail with him at Mar-a-Lago, a one-on-one meeting, the possibility of playing golf with him, a zoom call, and hand-signed memorabilia, among other things. Moreover, collectors are guaranteed a ticket at the Gala Dinner with Trump in Florida should they buy 45 cards.¬†

Trump fans also have the possibility of entering the sweepstakes without buying the trading cards. Sweepstakes entries are not tied to the digital cards themselves, meaning that collectors won‚Äôt be eligible for rewards if they buy the cards off of secondary markets. The website states that the money received through trading card sales would not be used to fund Trump‚Äôs political campaign.

Interestingly, the website calls the trading cards both ‚ÄúNFTs‚Äù and ‚Äúdigital collectibles‚Äù interchangeably. This is not the first time that a major brand uses ‚Äúdigital collectible‚Äù to describe the technology, since the word isn‚Äôt perceived quite so negatively by mainstream audiences as ‚ÄúNFTs.‚Äù Nevertheless, the website is careful to highlight that the cards are minted on Polygon, which it describes as eco-friendly and carbon neutral.¬†

I am holding DUK for several days. On Wednesday, it feels like everyone is expecting good news from the Fed, DUK has gone up to test the daily basis resistance. However bad news came out with Powell‚Äôs hawkish speech, the price has fallen to almost the open price. Yesterday, the market still hasn‚Äôt digested the Fed‚Äôs surprise and brought down DUK further. But I believe I am correct on the daily basis support at 101.81, because from 15 mins chart, DUK tried to reach that line and brought back in the afternoon trading hours.

Additionally, there is a trend support which is very close to the daily resistance. I think that‚Äôs a double support at around 101.5. Also, by looking at the economic calendar, I don‚Äôt think there will be any more terrible news coming out recently.

\-Fed is not even close to the bond market.  One will catch u with the other.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Econ Projections by the Fed is not good.  Expect 0.5 in 2023.

\- Also expect more inflation

\-And Fed Fund rate of 5.1%

\-Lastly we got our move from my chart I put out over last few days. Bearish break.  Look for retest then go short.

# PRINCIPAL SOLAR ANNOUNCES JOINT VENTURE WITH EXECUTIVE LOGISTICS &amp; TRANSPORTATION 

&amp;#x200B;

 

*Joint Venture Seeks to Expand ELT‚Äôs Current Reach into New Markets; Expand ELT‚Äôs Existing Vehicle Fleet, Convert Fleet Vehicles Using Principal Partner‚Äôs EV/Hybrid Technologies, and Generate Near-Term Revenue*

DALLAS, TEXAS, Dec. 15, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Principal Solar, Inc. (OTC Pink: PSWW) (‚ÄúPrincipal‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Company‚Äù), a strategic investor in organizations and technologies that support next- generation opportunities in traditional, renewable, and clean energy sectors as well as an investor in and operator of undervalued petroleum-producing properties, today announced that it has entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù) with Executive Logistics &amp; Transportation (‚ÄúELT‚Äù) for the purpose of expanding ELT‚Äôs existing logistics operations into new markets beyond its current activities in Tennessee and the Southeastern United States. Per the agreement, ELT will make an investment into Principal via a strategic restricted stock purchase, the proceeds from which are expected in part to fund the expansion of ELT‚Äôs existing fleet as well as the hybrid conversion of a portion of ELT‚Äôs fleet vehicles.

‚ÄúI believe this joint venture with ELT represents an exciting opportunity that leverages virtually all of Principal‚Äôs core strengths and stands to build positive forward momentum for both ELT and Principal,‚Äù said K. Bryce ‚ÄòRick‚Äô Toussaint, CEO and Chairman of Principal Solar. ‚ÄúOur primary goals for this Agreement are to generate near term revenue, expand ELT‚Äôs fleet and operations to take advantage of new market opportunities, and to gain ready access to a fleet of Class 8 trucks with the potential for future EV/Hybrid conversion with systems supplied by E Truck Transportation, one of Principal‚Äôs strategic investments. Along with our current minority investment in Double H Services LLC, we expect our venture with ELT to further expand our footprint into another region in the United States.‚Äù

Per the Agreement, Principal and ELT plan to launch business development initiatives intended to procure new logistics customers and contracts as well as to expand logistics services into new market sectors, with significant focus on the petroleum and concrete and aggregates industries.¬†ELT currently operates a fleet of approximately 30 Class 8 trucks and trailers, and the new joint venture is expected to facilitate an increase in fleet vehicle count as well as enable future EV and hybrid vehicle conversions.

Financial terms of the Agreement are expected to be disclosed at later date; however, due to its belief in the potential success of the new joint venture, ELT has already provided an initial tranche of working capital to Principal.

**About Executive Logistics &amp; Transportation**  
Executive Logistics &amp; Transportation, LLC (Executive L&amp;T), was established in 2020 with the overarching goal of leaving a long-lasting, positive imprint on the nation‚Äôs transportation industry. In doing so, one of ELT‚Äôs major responsibilities - and one of its core strengths ‚Äì is safely transporting heavy freight nationwide to help sustain our country‚Äôs supply chain.¬†ELT creates jobs and provides opportunities within the communities in which it operates as well as motivates and empowers those who need a second chance by welcoming those persons with prior justice system involvement.¬†ELT believes in doing its part to help break the vicious cycle that has plagued countless families and communities across this nation and has stepped up with real opportunities, thereby making real differences in people‚Äôs lives.",PSWW ready to run any day now with this update,1671128513
3808,StockMarket,"Elon Musk fan Cathie Wood seized a sizable chunk of Tesla stock (TSLA) late Wednesday after the stock extended a recent skid to its lowest level in more than two years.

ARK Invest, Wood‚Äôs investment management firm, snapped up 74,862 shares of the electric-vehicle maker across three of her exchange-traded funds, according to a daily transaction report sent via email. The purchase was valued around $11.7 million, based on Wednesday‚Äôs closing price of $156.80.

The snap-up by ARK also comes after Tesla's own chief executive officer Elon Musk sold approximately 21,995,000 shares of the company, or roughly $3.6 billion worth, during the three-day period ending Dec. 14, a regulatory filing showed after Wednesday's close.

ARK‚Äôs Tesla buy comprised 61,537 shares for the ARK Innovation fund (ARKK), 10,066 for the ARK Autonomous Tech. &amp; Robotics ETF (ARKQ), and 3,259 for the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW). Tesla is the third largest holding among ARK‚Äôs suite of investment products after Zoom Communications (ZM) and Exact Sciences (EXAS).

Wood's dip-buying spree comes during a difficult month amid a difficult year for Tesla as concerns intensify among investors that Musk as CEO diverted his attention away from the company to manage Twitter, the social media platform he recently acquired in a $44 billion take-private deal.

Tesla stock is down more than 19% in December so far and roughly 55% year-to-date. ARK's flagship ARK Innovation fund (ARKK) is down around 13% this month and 64% on the year.

ILAL has already pre-sold 75 of the 1,344 planned residential lots at Oasis Park Resort.*

*The completed Phase I development at Oasis Park Resort includes a two-mile main road from the highway to the Sea of Cortez as well as grading of the beach and marina. Phase II development is expected to commence in January 2023 and will include clubhouse and model home construction to facilitate onsite tours and sales. With home prices starting at $99,000, the Company‚Äôs Oasis Park Resort could ultimately generate over $30 million in gross lot sales and an additional $75 million in gross construction revenue. Home construction on pre-sold lots is expected to begin in Q1 2023.*

*Frank Ingrande, President of ILAL, commented, ‚ÄúAs announced earlier this week, we are seeing sales return to pre-COVID levels at our communities.

# [Stock futures fall a second day on fears the Fed will tip the economy into a recession](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were sharply lower Thursday following the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest policy update, as investors worried the central bank could tip the economy into a recession as it continues its fight against inflation.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 350 points, or 1.05%. S&amp;P 500 futures dropped 1.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1.59%.
*****
&gt; Tesla shares fell more than 2% in the premarket after CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his stake in the company.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields declined following the most recent Fed rate hike, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling below 3.5%.
*****
&gt; Those moves follow a down session Wednesday when the Dow fell 142 points, while the S&amp;P 500 declined 0.61% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.76%.
*****
&gt; Investors digested the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest comments following a boost to its overnight borrowing rate. The central bank said it will continue hiking rates through 2023 and projected a higher-than-expected terminal rate of 5.1%. With Wednesday‚Äôs half a percentage point hike, the targeted range for rates is currently 4.25% to 4.5%, which is the highest in 15 years.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúOverall, we expected to hear Chair Powell emphasize that the ‚Äòhard part‚Äô of returning inflation to 2.0% is just beginning. We largely received that message,‚Äù Bank of America‚Äôs Michael Gapen wrote in a Wednesday note.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe Fed remains willing to risk a recession in the labor market in order to bring inflation down and, if anything, the December projections suggest that risk has risen, not diminished. We agree and continue to look for a recession in 1H 2023 and a sharper rise in the unemployment rate than the median FOMC member projects,‚Äù Gapen added.
*****
&gt; Despite favorable improvements like modest growth, spending and production, Powell indicated he remains concerned job gains are too robust and the unemployment rate is too good for the Fed‚Äôs fight against inflation.
*****
&gt; Investors will get another batch of economic data to digest Thursday. Retail sales, jobless claims and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index are all due out at 8:30 a.m. ET.

3840,StockMarket,"Seen a few posts today that confuse me. Do people not understand why the stock market exists?

The shares you are holding have value to you because they represent a portion of a company's earnings, but after they are sold the company don't really care that you get some of their money. Trust only exists because they might want to sell shares again in the future.

To the company/person selling shares, selling shares means the money in the present and helps them accomplish things. Its something that means to happen and is part of business, and you should start by selling things you deem overvalued. 

Now companies don't just sell shares when they go public, they also sell them when interest rates are high. Now because they need to, but because it's cheaper to sell shares than get a loan.

Debt and selling equity work in similar ways. Both take your future earnings in return for cash now. The difference is the debt you are forced to pay back, but equity can have almost 0 impacts until you issue something like a dividend.

When interest rates are low, borrowing is appealing, because you really want to hold onto equity, but when debt is high, selling equity is cheaper short term and makes more sense. You can always buy them back tax-free after making the money.

Expect a lot more companies to choose option b from now on.",Selling Shares is the Reason Stocks Go Public!,1671097934

* Fed funds rate set to a range of 4.25% - 4.5%, raised 50 bps as expected.
* Revised the projection of median terminal rates from 4.6% to 5.1%, or 5%-5.25% for a rate range at the end of 2023, no pivot will happen until 2024. For now, there is still 75 bps to reach the projected terminal rate.
* February rate hike will be based on incoming data.
* Powell is hawkish on the rate hikes, believing that more rate hikes are appropriate. Said the Fed will not cut the rate until they are confident about the inflation moving down to the target 2% in a sustained way, more evidence needed to stop the rate hike.

CEO‚Äôs sale of Tesla stock has weighed on the company‚Äôs share price, which is down more than 50% in 2022

&amp;#x200B;

By Rebecca Elliott

Updated Dec. 14, 2022 10:44 pm ET

&amp;#x200B;

Elon Musk sold more than $3.5 billion worth of Tesla Inc. stock this week in his second round of sales since buying Twitter Inc.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Musk sold nearly 22 million Tesla shares over a three-day period ending Dec. 14, according to a regulatory disclosure made public Wednesday.

&amp;#x200B;

This week‚Äôs sales mean the Tesla chief executive has sold more than $39 billion in Tesla shares since the company‚Äôs stock peaked in November 2021. Tesla, still the world‚Äôs most valued auto maker by value, has lost more than $700 billion in market capitalization since that all-time high.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn‚Äôt clear what prompted Mr. Musk to sell additional Tesla stock, and the company didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment. On Tuesday, however, Mr. Musk tweeted, ‚ÄúAt risk of stating obvious, beware of debt in turbulent macroeconomic conditions, especially when Fed keeps raising rates.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Musk‚Äôs ownership of Twitter, which the billionaire bought in a deal valued at $44 billion in October, has gotten off to a tumultuous start. Last month, Mr. Musk said Twitter had suffered ‚Äúa massive drop in revenue‚Äù and was losing $4 million a day. He later invoked the specter of bankruptcy.

&amp;#x200B;

As part of the acquisition, Twitter took on around $13 billion in debt. That could leave the social-media company owing annual interest payments of more than $1 billion, analysts have estimated, compared with around $51 million in 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Musk‚Äôs focus on Twitter has irritated some Tesla investors as the company tracks for its worst annual stock-price performance on record.

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla shares closed down 2.58% Wednesday at $156.80, the lowest level in more than two years. The company‚Äôs stock price decline of around 55% in 2022 has eclipsed that of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, which has fallen roughly 29% year-to-date.

&amp;#x200B;

It has also weighed on Mr. Musk‚Äôs personal wealth, which has declined by more than $100 billion this year to around $160 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. On Tuesday, Mr. Musk ceded the unofficial title of world‚Äôs richest person to European mogul Bernard Arnault.

&amp;#x200B;

The Tesla CEO previously sold company stock in April, August and November of this year, linking the latter two batches of sales to Twitter. This month‚Äôs sales leave Mr. Musk owning roughly 13.4% of Tesla, meaning he remains the company‚Äôs largest shareholder by far.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, selling stock could weaken his control over Tesla, which has a single class of shares. Companies including Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. have multiple classes of shares, giving founders supervoting power over common shareholders.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Musk doesn‚Äôt accept a salary from Tesla and instead is compensated with stock awards. He also has used his Tesla holdings as collateral to secure personal debt.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to this year‚Äôs sales, Mr. Musk sold more than $16 billion of Tesla shares in November and December 2021. Much of that was earmarked to cover taxes associated with exercising vested stock options that would have expired this year.",Elon Musk Sold More Than $3.5 Billion Worth of Tesla Shares - Wall Street Journal,1671077704

If you were their lawyer, what strategy would you take to defend them? After reading the case, it seems they were not very sophisticated at all.

In August 2022, Voyager revealed in a court filing that Alameda Research had borrowed $1.6 billion in crypto, representing 61% of Voyager‚Äôs loan book. If these loans were exposed, then it becomes SBF‚Äôs problem, so he wants to cover it up by posing his partial repayment of the loan as a bailout and completing the sale of Voyager and BlockFi with FTX equity.

SBF effectively bankrupted both Voyager and FTX. In the course of his attempt to cover his and his staff‚Äôs losses, SBF adversely affected the deposits of two sets of clients. Maybe, he knew he was in deep shit at that point, so he took out a massive loan using somebody else‚Äôs money (Voyager and its clients) as collateral to try and cover his own positions.¬†

3915,StockMarket,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against eight individuals in a $100 million securities fraud scheme in which they used the social media platforms Twitter and Discord to manipulate exchange-traded stocks.

According to the SEC, since at least January 2020, seven of the defendants promoted themselves as successful traders and cultivated hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter and in stock trading chatrooms on Discord. These seven defendants allegedly purchased certain stocks and then encouraged their substantial social media following to buy those selected stocks by posting price targets or indicating they were buying, holding, or adding to their stock positions. However, as the complaint alleges, when share prices and/or trading volumes rose in the promoted securities, the individuals regularly sold their shares without ever having disclosed their plans to dump the securities while they were promoting them.

""As our complaint states, the defendants used social media to amass a large following of novice investors and then took advantage of their followers by repeatedly feeding them a steady diet of misinformation, which resulted in fraudulent profits of approximately $100 million,"" said Joseph Sansone, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division‚Äôs Market Abuse Unit. ""Today‚Äôs action exposes the true motivation of these alleged fraudsters and serves as another warning that investors should be wary of unsolicited advice they encounter online.""

The following seven individuals were charged with securities fraud:

**Name - State of Residence - Twitter Handle**

1. Perry Matlock - Texas - PJ\_Matlock¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
2. Edward Constantin - Texas - MrZackMorris
3. Thomas Cooperman - California - ohheytommy
4. Gary Deel - California - notoriousalerts
5. Mitchell Hennessey - New Jersey - Hugh\_Henne
6. Stefan Hrvatin - Florida - LadeBackk
7. John Rybarcyzk - Texas - Ultra\_Calls

The complaint further charges Daniel Knight (Twitter Handle: DipDeity), of Texas, with aiding and abetting the alleged scheme by, among other things, co-hosting a podcast in which he promoted many of the other individuals as expert traders and provided them with a forum for their manipulative statements. Knight also traded in concert with the other defendants and regularly generated profits from the manipulation.

3917,StockMarket,"Beta is a value that measures a security's volatility relative to the market as a whole. A stock with a beta value less than 1.00 is less volatile than the market. This can be appealing to investors who want to avoid the ups and downs or who are looking for more stable investments.

Low beta stocks can be a good choice for investors who are risk-averse or who have a conservative investment strategy. Because they are less likely to be affected by market movements, low beta stocks can provide a level of safety and predictability that may not be found in higher beta stocks.

Additionally, low beta stocks provide benefits of diversification to a portfolio. Because they have a lower correlation with the market, they can help to balance out the risks of other, more volatile investments in the portfolio.

Examples of stocks with low beta include utilities, consumer staples, and other companies that provide essential products. These companies typically have steady, predictable earnings and are less impacted by market fluctuations.

Investing in low beta stocks can be a wise way to provide stability to your portfolio. However, it's important to remember that all investments come with some risk and past performance is not a guarantee of future results. As with all investments, it's important to do your own research before making any decisions.

P.S: You can use our screeners to find low BETA stocks.

3919,StockMarket,"Binance Holdings Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao warned his colleagues to expect tough months ahead and said the firm will overcome current challenges, as the crypto billionaire tries to assuage concerns about the company‚Äôs financial health.

In a memo sent to staff, CZ, as the founder of the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange is known, said the industry for digital assets is going through ‚Äúa historic moment‚Äù and that Binance is in a strong financial position and ‚Äúwill survive any crypto winter.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhile we expect the next several months to be bumpy, we will get past this challenging period ‚Äì and we‚Äôll be stronger for having been through it,‚Äù he wrote in the memo seen by Bloomberg. He added that FTX‚Äôs recent collapse has brought with it ‚Äúa lot of extra scrutiny and tough questions‚Äù on his firm, referring to reports this week on customer withdrawals.

FTX‚Äôs shock collapse has rocked investor sentiment and prompted some traders to take control of their tokens, causing outflows at other exchanges. Binance was one of the exchanges hit by large outflows on Tuesday, which have since started to show signs of easing.

The memo and rebuttals on Twitter came on the back of a record number of net daily Bitcoin and Ether token outflows from Binance on Tuesday.

‚ÄúRest assured, this organization was built to last,‚Äù Zhao wrote in the memo.

*****

# [Stock futures are muted as investors await the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Wednesday as investors awaited the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest interest rate hike decision in its effort to crush inflation.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 2 points, or less than 0.1%. Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were also roughly flat.
*****
&gt; The Fed will conclude its December meeting and is expected to deliver a 50 basis-point rate hike. That‚Äôs a smaller bump after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes. A basis point is equal to one hundredth of one percent.
*****
&gt; Chair Jerome Powell will also speak Wednesday, giving further clues about what‚Äôs coming from the Fed in 2023. In previous meetings this year, traders have been sensitive to Powell‚Äôs language, interpreting his tone as hawkish or dovish.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWhile we expect the Fed to slow the pace of rate rises at its Wednesday meeting, policymakers are likely to stress that the job of curbing inflation is not yet over,‚Äù UBS‚Äô Mark Haefele wrote in a Wednesday note. ‚ÄúA slowing of job creation and wage growth will be needed before the Fed can stop hiking.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Stocks rose for a second day Tuesday, fueled by a cooler-than-anticipated inflation report. The November consumer price index was 7.1% on the year, less than the 7.3% gain expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The 0.1% increase from the previous month was also less than forecast.
*****
&gt; The signal that inflation may have peaked was positive for stocks as it means the Fed may be one step closer to halting interest rate hikes or switching to cuts, which would fuel equities.

If you‚Äôre looking to improve your trading performance, you may be tempted to add more indicators to your analysis. However, too many indicators can lead to clutter and confusion, and can actually have a negative impact on your trading performance. In this blog post, we‚Äôll look at how reducing the number of indicators you use can actually enhance your trading performance.

Understanding the Limitations of Indicators  
When it comes to trading, indicators are often not 100% reliable, as they may be based on past market data, and may not anticipate future trends or events. To identify false signals caused by a laggy trading tool, it is important to pay attention to discrepancies between expected outcomes and actual results. If the results of a trade are delayed or incorrect despite having followed signals that were generated via the trading tool, then this could be an indication that the tool is lagging. Other signs such as sudden changes in market trends, or false buy and sell signals may also indicate that a trading tool is lagging. It is important to monitor these indicators closely and make sure that the trading tool is working correctly before making any investment decisions.

Indicators can also suffer from lag, meaning they may not be useful in providing timely alerts when the market is volatile. This can manifest itself in false signals in the form of false positive trades or false negative trades. False positive trades happen when an indicator generates a signal to buy or sell, but the market acts contrary to what the indicator was predicting. False negative trades are when an indicator does not generate any signal despite a change in market conditions. A lagging indicator also has the potential to influence trader behavior and give false confidence if it is used without considering other factors. When trading with lagging indicators, it is important to consider multiple factors such as price action, volume and other technical indicators.  
üì∑  
Finally, traders should understand that indicators are meant to be used as a supplement to their own analysis and trading decisions and should not be relied on solely for making trading decisions Besides indicators being a helpful supplement, traders should be aware that indicators can also be lagging and cause traders to make decisions too late. If a trader fails to identify the indicators' lack of accuracy, they may unknowingly rely on indicators as the main decision-making tool, which can lead to costly trading mistakes. Therefore, indicators should be used in tandem with other forms of analysis and not as a stand-alone trading decision tool.

Why it can be Beneficial to Use Fewer Indicators  
Fewer indicators can help keep your trading decisions simpler and easier to understand. Markets can be unpredictable and having too many indicators can lead to laggy trading tools. As markets continuously evolve, it is important to select only the indicators that are reliable and reflect true market sentiment. Additionally, some indicators require a longer amount of time to show results while others provide instantaneous responses. When choosing indicators for markets, it is important to ensure that they are capable of providing meaningful information in a timely manner in order for your trading tool to perform optimally.

You will have more time to focus on analyzing the price action of the markets, instead of trying to decipher complicated trade signals when you use a high-performance trading tool. When markets become laggy or slow, there are various indicators that can alert you that your trading tool is not working optimally. Examples of these indicators include delays in the execution of orders, disconnection from the server, and frequent freezing. Fortunately, by using a reliable trading tool and keeping an eye out for such signals, you can maximize your chances of successful trades.

You will also be able to eliminate unnecessary noise from your charts, which can help you spot important trend reversals more quickly In conclusion, the laggy trading tool is a helpful tool for investors, helping to identify false signals and eliminate unnecessary noise from charts. This can help you ensure that you detect important trend reversals more quickly and accurately, which can help you make sound decisions about your trades.

Determining which Strategies Are the Most Effective  
Analyzing which strategies have the best returns over a certain period of time can help you determine which strategies are the most effective, especially when lagging is taken into account. If a trading tool appears to be lagging, it could be an indicator that the tool is not providing the most efficient steps for success. Comparing lagging activity with other strategies can give insight into why lagging is occurring and what steps can be taken to improve performance. By understanding lagging indicators and how it affects trading, investors can make informed decisions that ultimately result in more profitable investments.

Keeping track of the average profit or loss per trade is also important, as it can help you identify any potential losses or inefficiencies in your trading system. If your lagging trading tool consistently has lower profits than expected, it could indicate that the lagging indicator is not providing accurate results. It is important to monitor the lagging indicator to ensure that you are accurately interpreting market conditions and taking advantage of profitable trades. Additionally, if you find your lagging trading tool is lagging more than usual, this could be a sign that the parameters of your lagging indicator are no longer optimal and need to be adjusted. By monitoring your lagging indicators regularly, you can ensure that you are making profitable trades and avoiding losses due to lagging trading tools.

Utilizing a range of statistical indicators such as volatility, correlation, and moving averages can also be useful in determining which strategies are the most effective Meanwhile, utilizing a range of statistical indicators like volatility, correlation, and moving averages can be a helpful tool in determining which strategies are the most effective when dealing with lagging trading tools. By understanding the patterns and trends associated with these indicators, traders can gain a better understanding of lagging trading tools and how to use them to their advantage.

Developing Your Own Trading System  
Developing your own trading system requires a deep understanding of the markets and the ability to identify meaningful patterns. One of the most common tools used by traders to identify meaningful patterns are oscillators. Oscillators are mathematical calculations that oscillate between overbought and oversold levels to indicate when a market may be due for a reversal or a continuation. Oscillators can provide insight into the demand and supply which often provides an indication of where the price may go. Additionally, oscillators are often used in tandem with other technical analysis indicators, such as trend lines and support and resistance, to gain more confidence in trading decisions.

Backtesting is an important part of any trading system; it allows you to assess the performance of your strategy in the past and make tweaks for future success. One of the common indicators used for backtesting is oscillators, which are mathematical calculations that oscillate around a center line. Oscillators are used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in a market and signal potential trading opportunities. They can also be used to identify divergences, which indicate when momentum is slowing down or reversing its direction. By using oscillators during backtesting, traders can identify profitable trading opportunities and adjust their strategies accordingly.  
üì∑  
You should also use indicators to measure volatility and risk, so that you can react quickly to changes in market conditions Meanwhile, indicators can be used to measure volatility and risk which is important in order to adapt quickly to changing market conditions. Making sure you have an indicators tool is essential in making sure your trading tool isn't laggy and that it responds quickly. Indicators can help you make the best decisions in order to help your trading tool remain responsive and successful.

Setting Clear Trading Goals and Objectives  
Setting clear trading goals and objectives is essential to help traders stay focused when trading with a laggy tool. A lagging trading tool can be indicative of a low refresh rate, causing the trader to miss out on potential opportunities. Furthermore, lagging tools often fail to provide the most up-dated and accurate trading data. To identify lagging tools, traders should be aware of any lags in order entries, speeds of market data updates, lags between verifying orders and lags between order routes. Additionally, lags in latency or response times can also cause lagging tools. To combat this issue, traders should look out for tools that have high refresh rates and low latency periods in order to ensure they are able to make well-informed decisions with the most accurate information available.

A trader should always have realistic goals and know exactly what they are trying to achieve with each trade. Traders should be aware of the lagging indicators that their trading tools might possess. These lagging tools can come in the form of lagging algorithms, lagging data points, lagged market information, or lagged signals. All of these lagging indicators can lead to unexpected losses or gains that can be difficult to counteract. As such, it is important for traders to have a clear understanding of their trading environment and the lagging indicators that might be present. By being aware of these lagging indicators, a trader can adjust their strategy accordingly and improve their chances of successful trading.

It is also important to set stop-loss and take-profit levels to ensure that losses are minimized and profits are maximized similarly, false signals from the trading tool can indicate a laggy platform and it is crucial to set stop-loss and take-profit levels in order to limit your losses and maximize your profits. Although false signals should be taken seriously, they can also be a result of market conditions that are outside of your control. It's important to understand all the risks involved in trading before making any decisions.  
üì∑

Monitoring Performance for Continuous Improvement  
Monitoring the performance of trading tools is essential to ensure they are running smoothly and efficiently. Common indicators of a laggy trading tool include slow response times when placing orders, freezing screens, and error messages. Additionally, if the tool is taking longer than expected to receive data from the market, it could be an indicator that there are performance issues. It is important to address these issues quickly so trading strategies are not impacted.

Regularly testing the latency and speed of the trading tool can identify any issues that need to be addressed before they become a problem. If the trading tool is not as fast as it should be, it could indicate a laggy response time. As most traders rely on quick execution of trades and decisions, any lags can be a hindrance to success. Signs of laggy performance include slower order execution, delayed price feeds, and a slow response time from the platform. If any of these indicators are present, it may be time to investigate further and consider if additional resources or changes are needed to improve the speed of the trading tool.

By carefully tracking performance metrics, it is possible to continuously improve the accuracy and reliability of the trading tool over time Additionally, it is important to keep a close eye on the performance metrics of the trading tool, as this can help to identify any areas of lag. Keeping track of key performance indicators such as latency and throughput provide an effective way to measure the accuracy and reliability of the trading tool over time. With careful monitoring, it is possible to reduce any lags and make sure that the user experience is smooth and seamless.

To Conclude  
In conclusion, reducing the number of indicators you use may be one of the best ways to enhance your performance as a trader. Too many indicators can lead to clutter and confusion and can actually have a negative impact on your trading performance. Focus on learning more about the indicators you already have and start to make sense of the data they provide for you.

3997,StockMarket,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially charged disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (aka SBF) with defrauding investors, it revealed on Tuesday morning following his arrest in the Bahamas. The SEC said in a press release that in addition to being charges with fraud regarding equity investors in FTX, he‚Äôs also being investigated regarding other securities law violations ‚Äî and noted that there are ongoing investigations pending against others involved as well.

The SEC isn‚Äôt the only one getting a hand on this ball, however: Both the Southern District of New York‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs office and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also filed charges against SBF in ‚Äúparallel actions.‚Äù

The complaint from the U.S. securities regulator alleges that while Bankman-Fried presented FTX as ‚Äúa safe, responsible crypto asset trading platform,‚Äù in reality the founder sometimes described as ‚Äòcrypto‚Äôs white knight‚Äô was engaged in a ‚Äúyears-long fraud‚Äù designed to hide from FTX investors the fact that their funds were being redirected to SBF‚Äôs Alameda crypto hedge fund, while Alameda enjoyed a kind of favored status that protected it from the usual risk mitigation measures FTX employed. The SEC also takes issue with the degree of exposure FTX had to Alameda‚Äôs very large holdings of ‚Äúilliquid assets such as FTX-affiliated tokens.‚Äù

Also included in the complaint are allegations that FTX customer funds were employed via Alameda for other expenditures including VC investments, ‚Äúlavish real estate purchases,‚Äù and political donations, all of which have been documented in numerous reports and in some cases, by SBF‚Äôs own admission during his many interviews following the collapse of his businesses.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler reiterated his oft-repeated position that in fact, crypto trading platforms need to comply with existing securities laws in a quote in the release announcing the charges. This stands to be likely the most impactful and significant test of that position to date, since SBF‚Äôs specific charges in this action are allegations of violation of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. One consequence if SBF is convicted could be that he‚Äôs banned from future securities trading beyond as an individual, and prevented from acting as a corporate officer or board member, in addition to monetary penalties.

* The withdrawals came as crypto exchange FTX, a Silvergate customer, collapsed in scandal, raising questions about the stability of the digital asset industry.
* At the end of December, $150 million of the bank‚Äôs deposits were held by customers who had filed bankruptcy, Silvergate said.

Shares of Silvergate Capital sank nearly 40% on Thursday after the crypto-focused bank released preliminary fourth-quarter results that showed massive customer withdrawals.

Total deposits from digital asset customers declined to $3.8 billion from $11.9 billion at the end of the third quarter, a decline of roughly 68%. The withdrawals came as crypto exchange FTX, a Silvergate customer, collapsed in scandal, raising questions about the stability of the digital asset industry. Silvergate said there was a ‚Äúcrisis of confidence across the ecosystem.‚Äù

 At the end of December, $150 million of the bank‚Äôs deposits were held by customers who had filed for bankruptcy protection, Silvergate said.

In order to raise cash during this period, Silvergate sold $5.2 billion of debt securities, creating a loss on sale of $718 million. It reported $4.6 billion in total cash and cash equivalents held at the end of December.

‚ÄúIn response to the rapid changes in the digital asset industry during the fourth quarter, we took commensurate steps to ensure that we were maintaining cash liquidity in order to satisfy potential deposit outflows, and we currently maintain a cash position in excess of our digital asset related deposits,‚Äù CEO Alan Lane said in a statement.

Silvergate also announced that it is laying off 200 employers, or about 40% of its workforce, and exited its mortgage warehouse lending business.

Thursday‚Äôs stock move erased a big rally for Silvergate on Wednesday, when shares gained 27%.

Silvergate, which went public in 2019, saw its stock rise as high as $222 per share in November 2021, the same month as the peak price in Bitcoin. Silvergate share ended 2022 at $17.40, more than 90% off its all-time high.

What is IV? 

Implied volatility, or IV, is a measure of how much the price of a stock or other underlying asset is expected to fluctuate in the future. In options trading, IV is important because it affects the price of options contracts.  The price of an options contract is made up of two parts: the intrinsic value and the extrinsic value.¬†   


IV crush, also known as an ""implied volatility crush,"" is a phenomenon that occurs in the options market when the implied volatility of an options contract suddenly decreases. This can happen for various reasons, such as changing market conditions or expiring options contracts.

Today is going to be a momentum-based day for the markets. Take advantage of the opportunities to trade, but be smart and passive with your allocations to ensure you are practicing risk management. Trade only when given a confirmation of a reversal, and do not attempt to catch any falling knives today. 

Watch out and be careful when attempting to trade high-beta stocks at the moment that you believe are undervalued due to the relatively high price that it was at one point. I would recommend you look into allocating to low-risk, high-reward futuristic plays that provide security and assurance that the organization will do well. This is not a recommendation to get into tech nor pharma but more of a recommendation to get into consumer staples and other organizations that are related to them.

65,StockMarket,"**OVERALL:** Further bearish consolidation across all 3x majors, as price action occured entirely within yesterday's move and also occured on average volume. Daily MAs are now at-or-below technical resistance levels, which will only make the bulls have to work that much harder to overcome. While price may still rise on the days-week timeframe (e.g. micro trend), such a move would very much be part of natural, bearish consolidation on the weeks-month timeframe (e.g. macro trend).

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**: 12x days into this bear flag &amp; trading occurred entirly within yesterday's move and on average volume. If price continues higher, then the nearest resistance is 387.41 top of the flag which is now also being bolstered by the crossage of 3x MAs: 20, 50, and 100. Additionally, the major resistance at 389.63 gap fill remains just above this level. A secondary major resistance level is at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill; of note, gap fill is now also where the 200 DMA has fallen down into. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel. If price pivots lower, nearest support remains the bottom of the flag at 374.77 -- with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low. 

https://preview.redd.it/mg0jmtito4aa1.jpg?width=2315&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2db7b6af963466e556623e425ecea4b8e140c55

**QQQ:** Price remained entirely within yesterday's move here as well, and may still be the 7th day of a bear flag pattern. If price continues higher, then the nearest resistance is 271.50 the ascending TL which got tagged yesterday.  If price can get through that level, there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st (also where the 20 DMA crossed below today). Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.  If price pivots lower, nearest support remains 259.08 the previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.

https://preview.redd.it/3xpgh127o4aa1.jpg?width=2311&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2fd69f256e24fbc43a45bc257cd0167a4b2cb3c

**IWM:** 12x days into this bear flag; trading occurred on average volume &amp; entirely within yesterday's movement, again.  Both the 20 DMA and ceiling of the bear flag were tested again today, and held again.  This obviously weakens the level from a resistance standpoint, but it remains the nearest resistance point at 176.80 if price continues higher.  Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th, which is now also where the 50 and 100 DMAs have crossed/converged. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL.  If price heads lower, 170.67 the flag's bottom is still the nearest support level, followed by 169.11 the pre-COVID high. Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows.

**Position Size**:  0.75%  
**Remaining Size**:  0.75%  
**Thesis**:  I entered this trade over a few tranches as price fell into several major support levels dating back to late 2020. Today's move brought price to 4.13 gap-window and the 20 DMA, at which point I exited half the position.  Ultimately, the move today filled the ap at 4.34 before pulling back slightly towards the end of the day.  I will look to exit the 2nd half tomorrow depending on how price reacts through the overnight.

**Position Size**:  0.5%  
**Thesis**: I entered this trade as price hit its 16th day of forming a bear flag and as it reached the highest point of the consolidation zone which formed the flag.  I entered with only a 0.5% position thinking I would add another 0.5% to 1% if price returned to $98 -- but it never this that secondary/add level.  I chose to exit this position as price hit 87.45 the 200 DMA.  Had the position size been larger, I would've exited half the position to let the other half run, but given it was just the entry-size, I closed the trade entirely. 

https://preview.redd.it/ltalkgygh5aa1.jpg?width=2311&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c0ae17945885216c75a48ecc5c4303505893341

**Return**:  + 6.9%  
**Entry Date**:  12/30/2022  
**Entry Price**:  85.92  
**Exit Price**:  91.65  
**Position Size**:  0.5%  
**Thesis**:  I entered this trade after missing the entry I actually wanted, which occurred two days prior as price fell into 2x major support levels.  However, price lingered close enough around those support levels, which allowed me to get in without ""chasing"" too-too terrible.  I only entered a 0.5% position in the event price continued lower after the New Year, but it did not.  Therefore, I chose not to exit the position yesterday when it hit the 20 DMA because of my small position size -- and likewise, I do not want to wait until price reaches that descending TL at the risk of price reversing beforehand.  In short, the small position size did not give me a much flexibility as I would've liked in this trade, but I would rather have less manueverability getting out of positions if it means preserving capital to maneuver into positions.

**Type**:  Buy to Open  
**Symbol**:  MOS  
**Entry Price**:  42.39  
**Position Size**:  0.5%  
**Thesis**:  I entered this position today as price piereced a double-bottom hitting major support.  The reason I only took a 0.5% position is becuase the choppy grind down to the level, in addition to the consolidation from December 15 - 27, would make it not surprising if we saw more downside in the near term.  My next add level is 39.95 gap-fill from mid-January 2022, which coincides with a bullish consolidation zone whcih occured in late-December 2021.

I'm a 35 year old father of a 1 year old son. Inm a cop, so i work in shifts (mornings, evenings and nights). I'm currently investing about ‚Ç¨750 a month in IWDA on DeGiro and around ‚Ç¨350 a month on crypto (BTC and ETH).

In a recent post i made (resum√© of my finances in 2022), somebody replied that i would be better of stopping my investments in crypto and using that money to study to become a better investor. That seems like a great idea, but i'm not sure where you start. 

I'm not a complete noob, as i've been watching a couple of investing YouTube channels in 2022 and i've read a couple of books concerning fire and money management. I've also veen following some Reddit communities concerning investing, so i have a (small) basic understanding about finance, investing and risk management.

Do you guys have any recomendations on courses or studies i could follow? Taking into account that i work around 26 days a month (i know, it's a lot but it gets me paid) and i cannot go go class on a regular basis. So studying at home is a must.

90,StockMarket,"Federal Reserve officials are committed to fighting inflation and expect higher interest rates to remain in place until more progress is made, according to minutes released Wednesday from the central bank‚Äôs December meeting.

At a meeting where policymakers raised their key interest rate another half a percentage point, they expressed the importance of keeping restrictive policy in place while inflation holds unacceptably high.

‚ÄúParticipants generally observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to 2 percent, which was likely to take some time,‚Äù the meeting summary stated. ‚ÄúIn view of the persistent and unacceptably high level of inflation, several participants commented that historical experience cautioned against prematurely loosening monetary policy.‚Äù

The increase ended a streak of four consecutive three-quarter point rate hikes, while taking the target range for the benchmark fed funds rate to 4.25%-4.5%, its highest level in 15 years.

Officials also said they would focus on data as they move forward and see ‚Äúthe need to retain flexibility and optionality‚Äù regarding policy.

Officials further cautioned that the public shouldn‚Äôt read too much into the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee‚Äôs move to step down the pace of increases.

‚ÄúA number of participants emphasized that it would be important to clearly communicate that a slowing in the pace of rate increases was not an indication of any weakening of the Committee‚Äôs resolve to achieve its price-stability goal or a judgment that inflation was already on a persistent downward path,‚Äù the minutes said.

Following the meeting, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that while there has been some progress made in the battle against inflation, he saw only halting signs and expects rates to hold at higher levels even after the increases cease.

The minutes reflected those sentiments, noting that no FOMC members expect rate cuts in 2023, despite market pricing.

Markets currently are pricing in the likelihood of rate increases totaling 0.5-0.75 percentage point before pausing to evaluate the impact the increases are having on the economy. Traders expect the central bank to approve a quarter-point increase at the next meeting, which concludes Feb. 1, according to CME Group data.

Current pricing also indicates the possibility of a small reduction in rates by the end of the year, with the funds rate landing around a range of 4.5%-4.75%. Fed officials, however, have expressed doubt repeatedly about any loosening of policy in 2023.

The minutes noted that officials are wrestling with two-pronged policy risks: One, that the Fed doesn‚Äôt keep rates high long enough and allows inflation to fester, similar to the experience in the 1970s; and two, that the Fed keeps restrictive policy in place too long and slows the economy too much, ‚Äúpotentially placing the largest burdens on the most vulnerable groups of the population.‚Äù

However, members said they see the risks more weighted to easing too soon and allowing inflation to run rampant.

‚ÄúParticipants generally indicated that upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the outlook for policy,‚Äù the minutes said. ‚ÄúParticipants generally observed that maintaining a restrictive policy stance for a sustained period until inflation is clearly on a path toward 2 percent is appropriate from a risk-management perspective.‚Äù

Along with the rate hikes, the Fed has been reducing the size of its balance sheet by allowing up to $95 billion in proceeds from maturing securities to roll off each month rather than be reinvested. In a program started in early June, the Fed has seen its balance sheet contract by $364 billion to $8.6 trillion.

While some of the recent inflation metrics have shown progress, the labor market, a critical target of the rate increases, has been resilient. Nonfarm payroll growth has exceeded expectations for most of the past year, and data earlier Wednesday showed that there the number of job openings is still nearly twice the pool of available workers.

The Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index less food and energy, was at 4.7% annually in November, down from its 5.4% peak in February 2022 but still well above the Fed‚Äôs 2% target.

Economists, meanwhile, largely expect the U.S. to enter a recession in the coming months, the result of the Fed‚Äôs tightening and an economy dealing with inflation still running near 40-year highs. However, fourth-quarter GDP for 2022 is tracking at a solid 3.9% rate, easily the best of a year that started out with consecutive negative readings, according to the Atlanta Fed.

Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Wednesday, in a post for the district‚Äôs web site, that he sees the funds rate rising to 5.4% and possibly higher if inflation doesn‚Äôt trend down.

**Halberd Corporation** [(OTC PINK:HALB)](https://pr.report/PvQSc98H) The second half of 2022 was a very busy time.

**2022 2nd** **HALF ACHIEVEMENTS**

* Halberd's previous research on development of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) was found to enhance the effectiveness of the leading commercial COVID antibody by 44.4%.
* Halberd formed a Cancer Therapeutics Subsidiary, *Halberd Cancer Therapeutics, LTD*, to allow cancer treatment research to continue in parallel and synergistically with Halberd's work on the development of treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. Halberd's base extracorporeal technology is flexible enough to treat numerous diseases through tailoring of designed antibodies. The subsidiary's mission is to develop treatments for various types of cancer utilizing the combined patented and patent-pending technology of both Halberd Corporation, and Halberd Cancer Therapeutics, LTD.
* Carl Eller, the President of the NFL Retired Player's Association issued an open letter endorsing Halberd's efforts in its research into effective treatments for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), which affects many former and current professional athletes, particularly professional football players.
* Halberd was able to demonstrate precise control of a key Cancer related T-Cell protein, PD-1 (programmed cell death-1). PD-1 can be used by tumor cells to fool the body's immune system into allowing the tumor to grow. Precise control of PD-1 levels can allow the body's immune system to attack and eliminate the tumor.
* Halberd entered a strategic alliance with *AI Longevity, Inc*. and *Stem of Hope* as a wholly owned subsidiary of Halberd Corporation named ""ExtendalifeTM."" The mission of this subsidiary is to develop treatments intended to increase longevity and develop successful Alzheimer's Disease and Cancer treatments using the combined patented and patent-pending technologies of the alliance member companies.
* Halberd's researchers successfully demonstrated the removal of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) from human blood serum during in-vitro laboratory studies. Excess IL-6 is associated with inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, MS, some cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Halberd had earlier demonstrated its ability to precisely control the levels of target antigens present in bodily fluid.
* Halberd created a single designed monoclonal antibody which has demonstrated the ability to eradicate multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria from buffer solution in the laboratory. The antibody, with a strong affinity to E. coli and similar bacteria, was conjoined to a metallic nanoparticle and exposed to laser emissive energy. The exposed bacteria were eliminated in a matter of minutes.
* Halberd's in-vitro laboratory tests successfully demonstrated eradication of five identified cancer disease antigens -- CTLA-4, PD-1, PDL-1, IL-6, and TNF-Alpha -- through the use of laser emissive energy, similar to how antibiotic-resistant bacteria were eliminated.
* Halberd reached an agreement with the Hamden Group, a newly formed corporation which consists of members of the Peter Croden family and Darren Hamans. Peter Croden was the former president of Upjohn Corp, Canada, and Upjohn, Europe. Hamden will have worldwide exclusive rights to sell, market and distribute the Halberd patented low dose Naltrexone medication, and the Halberd proprietary Vita-Shield-MaxTM nutraceutical product.
* Halberd's COVID research led to the publication of a peer reviewed scientific article titled, ""*A Novel Plant-Made Monoclonal Antibody Enhances the Synergetic Potency of an Antibody Cocktail Against The SARS-Cov-2 Omicron Variant.""* The article is available [on-line](https://pr.report/4ETKjrAI).
* Halberd's CEO, William A. Hartman, and CTO, Dr. Mitchell S. Felder, in an October ""The Street Reports"" podcast, discussed Halberd's groundbreaking accomplishments utilizing its extracorporeal technology in treating major diseases which heretofore had been regarded as incurable. In December, Hartman and Felder again participated in a ""The Street Reports"" podcast to discuss Halberd's success in eradicating major Cancer disease antigens.
* Halberd researchers recently requested and received from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) an array of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) for testing Halberd's laser eradication technology which had successfully eradicated numerous Gram-Negative bacteria in prior experimentation.
* Halberd prepared a Form 15 for filing with the SEC to restore Halberd as a compliant, up-to-date, fully reporting company. This action should lead to the near term removal of the YIELD sign from the HALB stock symbol on the OTC Markets site.
* We have engaged with a Congressional Representative from Pennsylvania seeking his support in exposing Halberd's technology for the treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and suicide ideation to various government agencies, such as DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). DARPA has already reviewed preliminary material and has shown interest in receiving additional information. Follow-up will proceed in Q1-2023.

**THE LOOK AHEAD**

* Halberd is finalizing the arrangements with Mississippi State University to develop and conduct an animal testing protocol for Halberd's patent-pending nasal spray to safely counteract the effects of Traumatic Brain Injury.
* Halberd has the option to consider loans to complete the required audits and the QB up-list. However, Halberd's Articles of Incorporation preclude the issuance of any convertible promissory notes, convertible preferred stock or other convertible instruments. Halberd has chosen to remain as ""OTC Markets Pink Sheets"" for the near-term.
* Halberd is about to embark on a huge previously unannounced expansion of its capability to eradicate multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria with a single proprietary antibody. While that will require a major focus by Halberd, it offers the largest potential short-term payback to the company and its stockholders.
* Halberd's goal has always been to either secure a significant government contract or partner with Big Pharma, because it did not have the huge quantity of funds necessary to secure FDA approval for its products or processes.
* Government contracts and Big Pharma are not concerned with a company's stock exchange listing; they are focused on the content of the technology being evaluated. With each accomplishment, Halberd moves closer to finalizing a potential government contract and suitable terms for an agreement with Big Pharma.
* Leadership is about making tough decisions using the facts to obtain optimum results. Halberd believes that its interests are best served for the short-term by investing its available resources to advance our technology through R&amp;D and put Halberd in a better position to secure a potential government contract and/or a relationship with Big Pharma.

**SUMMARY**

Halberd management has guided the company thus far to achieve technological advancements beyond those of Big Pharma. Halberd's success was demonstrated by way of publication of the peer-reviewed journal article and recent press release concerning Halberd's successful development of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against Covid and Halberd's single antibody which has been shown effective against multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We believe that our decision to focus on R&amp;D is right for both the short- and long-term interests of the company and its stockholders.

We believe in our mission to create and develop safe and effective treatments against many previously perceived incurable diseases and continue to make progress towards achieving that goal.

We appreciate the efforts of our expanding team of research scientists, and the support of our stockholders. We will continue to maintain transparency and regular communication with our family of interested parties.

Sincerely,

William A. Hartman

I don‚Äôt quite fully understand the difference between the way it works on the fund‚Äôs side when someone invests via a mutual fund vs an ETF.

This brings the question, when people invest in an ETF rather than a mutual fund (let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs an ETF with the same shares and allocation, only difference being fund vs ETF) does this affect the volume data for each individual share differently?  I mean if someone buys an ETF which results in buying 100 $GOOG shares, or a fund which results in 100 $GOOG shares - does the fact that it was purchased via ETF change the way we see volume data?  For example, do ETFs show on a chart an impact ok volume data whereas the way a fund purchases shares being different, it somehow doesn‚Äôt show as volume on a chart - and therefore kind of hidden?

If there is a difference somehow, I‚Äôm wondering with ETF popularity growth, how might this change the way we view volume data in terms of spotting accumulation / distribution.

Heikin-Ashi candles are a type of technical analysis tool used in trading. They are similar to regular candlestick charts but differ in how they are constructed.¬†

Heikin-Ashi candles are created by taking the average of certain price data from the prior period, such as the open, close, high, and low prices. This average is then used to plot the candles on the chart.

The purpose of using Heikin-Ashi candles is to provide a smoother and more accurate representation of the price action compared to regular candlestick charts. In addition, they are beneficial for identifying trends and potential entry and exit points in the market.

Interpreting the candles

To interpret the trend, you can look at the color of the candle's body. If the body is green, the average price has increased over the period, and the trend is bullish. If the body is red, the average price has decreased over the period, and the trend is bearish.

In addition to the color of the body, you can also look at the candle's wick. If the wick is long, it indicates a significant price movement during the period, and the trend may be losing momentum.

SmallCapVoice.com Inc. (‚ÄúSCV‚Äù) announces the availability of a new interview with Dr. Adi Zuloff-Shani, CEO of Clearmind Medicine Inc. (NASDAQ: CMND) (CSE: CMND) (FWB: CWY), to discuss the biotech company‚Äôs use of non-hallucinogenic psychedelic compounds to treat physical and mental health, including addiction.

Clearmind‚Äôs intellectual portfolio consists of seven patent families. Its lead candidate, CMND-100, is derived from 5-methoxy-2-aminoindane (MEAI), a psychoactive molecule that exerts a euphoric alcohol-like experience and a reduced desire to consume alcohol. CMND-100 is headed for clinical trials in early 2023 as a potential treatment for alcohol-use disorder (AUD), and Clearmind is also exploring the use of its MEAI-based compound to treat cocaine addiction and depression.

Earlier this month, Clearmind was granted a patent from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for the use of its proprietary MEAI as an alcoholic beverage substitute. Speaking with SCV‚Äôs Stuart Smith, Dr. Zuloff-Shani explains the global need for such treatment.

‚ÄúThe number of alcoholics is striking,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about millions around the world. Alcohol consumption contributes to 3 million deaths each year globally. It is the third leading, preventable cause of death in the U.S. and the yearly cost is enormous ‚Äì around $200-$250 billion and that‚Äôs in 2010.‚Äù

Despite the statistics, Dr. Zuloff-Shani says that existing treatment options in this largely underserved market are largely ineffective. ‚ÄúYou would think that a huge problem probably has a lot of treatments to offer,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs just the opposite. Since 1950, only three treatments were approved by the FDA. I cannot say that any of them are very effective or have no adverse events associated with it.‚Äù

In pre-clinical studies, however, MEAI has demonstrated promising efficacy in individuals who struggle with alcohol, helping to break the addiction cycle. Clearmind‚Äôs interest in the component came from the testimonials of people who purchased it to better manage their alcohol consumption.

As Dr. Zuloff-Shani explains in the interview, Clearmind paid attention to those experiences and the company selling the MEAI component online. Convinced of MEIA‚Äôs potential as a safe treatment option, it then acquired certain worldwide patents of MEAI used that information as an entry point for its own compound. Now, Clearmind is working on an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA as it advances toward clinical studies of MEAI next year.

‚ÄúUsually when you develop a compound, you start from the other direction. You have an idea. You develop a compound and then you go to petri dishes and to animals, and finally you walk that you will have the same signal as, as you had in animals and in petri dishes in humans,‚Äù explains Dr. Zuloff-Shani. ‚ÄúHere, we are just doing the reverse process. We understand \[MEAI\] has the potential to be effective and safe ‚Ä¶ we decided that we want to do it in a safe place and take the FDA route.‚Äù

Smith then shifts the conversation toward Clearmind‚Äôs most recent developments and the strength of its management team, staff and scientific advisory board. Dr. Zuloff-Shani describes the structure of Clearmind‚Äôs operations and how it benefits corporate objectives and overhead.

‚ÄúWe have a very impressive staff in the company,‚Äù says Dr. Zuloff-Shani, who is well-versed in navigating regulatory pathways through her more than 20 years of experience in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a lot of people, and this is by choice. We prefer to work in outsourcing because that enables us to manage our expenses better. On the other hand, it allows us to really collaborate in every field that we are dealing with.‚Äù

The interview concludes with what Clearmind expects to achieve in the New Year and how it plans to overcome the challenges associated with advancing toward clinical trials.

‚ÄúThe most important milestone we need to hit on 2023 is this IND application ‚Ä¶ this is really a major event in any company. We expect to have two clinical sites: one in the United States and one in Israel. So, it will be two applications to do different regulatory borders, asking the permission to start clinical trials, and then of course to start a clinical trial,‚Äù says Dr. Zuloff-Shani. ‚ÄúAnd then I hope that you interview me in December next year and I will tell you that we are now at the last stages of the study or reaching completion of the study.‚Äù",(NASDAQ: CMND) Is set to disrupt the mental health and addiction medicine markets with intellectual portfolio consists of seven patent families,1672843853

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street tries to recover from Tuesday‚Äôs rocky session](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures traded higher Wednesday as Wall Street tries to recover its footing after a tough first session of the year.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 55 points, or 0.17%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.23% and 0.44%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Sentiment was boosted in part by encouraging inflation data from Europe, including a greater-than-expected decline in the French consumer price index and a drop in German import prices.
*****
&gt; U.S. stocks started 2023 on a downbeat note Tuesday as rising rate concerns, high inflation and recessionary fears crushed hopes that Wall Street could kick off the new year on a positive note. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4% and 0.8%, respectively, while the Dow closed just below breakeven. The major indexes were also pressured by steep declines in Apple and Tesla shares.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúU.S. stocks were unable to hold onto earlier gains as restrictive policy and recession fears remained front and center for investors,‚Äù wrote Oanda‚Äôs senior market analyst Ed Moya in a note to clients Tuesday. ‚ÄúDiscount buying triggered another bear market rebound that didn‚Äôt last long at all.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Investors will gain more insight into what Fed members are thinking on Wednesday afternoon as minutes from the central bank‚Äôs latest policy meeting are released. Earlier in the day, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, and ISM manufacturing data are due out.
*****
&gt; Friday‚Äôs December jobs report also will be closely watched as it is the last read on the labor market before the Fed meeting in February.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIt is too early to start betting on a Fed pivot this year and that should make this difficult environment for stocks,‚Äù Moya said.

## ‚ô¶Ô∏è 1/Œ©. The contents of The Book of Fraudits were revealed by the prophet Mazars LLP.

In the interest of keeping it real The Oracle Of Tulips would like everyone to know that even she was totally not prepared for the levels of chicanery and pure *chutzpah* contained in the pages of The Book of Fraudits. ‚Äú

*Quis audit auditores* indeed.

#### üìú The Book of Fraudits Ch. 1 üìú 

Crypto.com showed the world three nearly blank pages published by an accounting firm called Mazars LLP and tried to convince the world that these pages constituted a complete and transparent view of Crypto.com‚Äôs finances even though Crypto.com had seen fit to redact all the actual dollar amounts for ‚Äúconfidentiality reasons‚Äù. 

Apparently no one explained to Kris Marszalek and the rest of Crypto.com‚Äôs executive team that confidentiality isn‚Äôt part of the audit process. In fact the word *audit* comes from the the Latin *auditus* which means ""a hearing‚Äù or ‚Äúa listening"". We use this word because undergoing an audit back in ‚Äúthe day‚Äù involved standing up in front of a crowd of old men with really severe eyebrows and the power to order your execution and explaining yourself which is literally the opposite of confidentiality.

In the end it wasn‚Äôt an issue. The world only had a few days to wonder about whether or not the accountants at Mazars LLP were actually geniuses who had invented a groundbreaking new approach to the audit process before the firm suddenly made it known that actually this was totally not an audit and they had been kidding the whole time lol. The whole specacle was kind of amazing but not as amazing as the fact that many of Crypto.com‚Äôs users were [completely convinced](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crypto_com/) by an ‚Äúaudit‚Äù without a single number on it.

168,StockMarket,"**OVERALL:**  Today's price action saw some very cool levels being hit or nearly hit from a technical perspective across all 3x majors.  The gap-up at the opening bell, followed by an immediate sell-off and then consolidation at the lower range of the 10-min chart candles suggests a bear-flag was built at that very micro, intraday time frame.  This is not to say tomorrow will be a continuation of that down move, just that price definitely consolidated from about 11:20 until the closing bell at the lower range of the trading day.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**: 11x days into this bear flag &amp; trading occurred across just-almost the entirty of the bear flag itself.  Price just missed doing the same head fake / fake out as we saw on IWM.  If price continues lower, nearest support remains the bottom of the flag at 374.77 -- with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low.  If price turns around &amp; heads higher, then the nearest resistance is 387.41 top of the flag, followed closely by what could be major resistance at 389.63 gap fill which is also where the 20, 50, and 100 DMAs are converging. A secondary major resistance level is at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel.

**QQQ:** Given today's price action, I will amend my ""bear flag"" measurement from December 13th to December 22nd, which means today's candle could be the 6th day of what is becoming a bear flag pattern.  Today's move to just miss that ascending TL (which had only recently become a resistance level) played out perfectly as price pulled back from the level. If price continues lower, nearest support remains 259.08 the previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.   If price turns back around &amp; heads higher, then the nearest resistance is 270.70 (that same ascending TL), but it could be 'weaker' now. If price can get through that level, there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st (also where the 20 DMA is sitting). Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.

**IWM:** 11x days into this bear flag &amp; trading occurred across just-almost the entirty of the bear flag itself.  Beautiful pierce of the flag &amp; 20 DMA, which I suspect caught many traders off guard, as price pulled back from that level into the flag as a head-fake / fake break out.  If price continues lower, 170.67 the flag's bottom is back to being a support level, followed by 169.11 the pre-COVID high. Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows.  If price turns around &amp; higher, then the nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's high. Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL.

171,StockMarket,"First day of the season and good ol gold is already outperforming everything else.  If you were in JNUG you could have been up 6% already for the year.  Meanwhile what did SPX do?

I know roll your eyes, this is another Gold Bug who's been clamoring for Gold since the 1800s something something about fiat currencies and doomsday stuff and hiding in a bunker .. and my papa was a 49er... ACTUALLY NO!  I only hopped in gold at the end of 2022, because I see commodities (personally gold) and volatility selling strategies as the best performing asset class in 2023 AGAIN.  And because I'm so bullish on gold outperforming other asset classes, that **I'm actually hoping to get some counter arguments from the big brained folks here before I max my credit to buy gold**.

# Ok!

As you all know, while every asset class like stocks, bonds, etc... even gov treasuries crashed this year (believe it or not, your super duper safe haven super safe US treasury ETF $TLT fell 30% this year - so much for safety amirite), gold and many other commodities maintained it's value and even so in a RISING RATE environment üòÆ.  Although 2023 probably won't be as bad as 2022, I still see gold outperforming other asset classes for mostly the same reason it did in 2022.

**Why did gold outperform in 2022**?

1. Gold showed that once again it's a place where you can **really store value**.  Remember all the hype of Cryptos and all the TikTok stars clamoring cryptos are a store of value and inflation hedge and yada yada??  How's that correlation with the overall stock market work out?  How's boys like SBF and the lack of regulation work out in building investor confidence?  You think institutions will still maintain confidence in it and market it to their clients?  How's hypemen like Tom Brady and Matt Damon do for investor confidence as well?  While I believe in block chain tech, let's be honest, we are probably gonna have a winter for a bit because there isn't stimmies flowing out left and right, and let's be honest, a lot of people - the later bandwagoners, probably lost a bunch of money getting into it thinking it's a store of value and valid currency and not as a speculative asset, so probably have a bad taste in their mouths.  Oh! And mining bitcoin is bad for the environment.  You can't live in the West and be pro bitcoin or you are bad heartless person: [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/eu-will-likely-ban-bitcoin-to-no-avail](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/eu-will-likely-ban-bitcoin-to-no-avail) , just like you can't be pro fossil fuels, pro meat consumption, etc... all bad people stuff.  So it's time to get with the times and be anti-cryptos as well or eventually you are a bad person too.  And you don't want to be a bad person otherwise you end up like Putin.  Cryptos soon won't be ""vogue"" anymore when the next gen of kids get brainwashed because cryptos kill polar bears.  The powers that be are already setting this in motion.  Don't be that boomer in the next gen's eyes...
2. Gold maintained it's value in 2022 not only because it's a store of value, but also of **central bank buying**.  [https://www.ft.com/content/e0983ebb-bbe0-4d33-8517-e19fa06e1a77](https://www.ft.com/content/e0983ebb-bbe0-4d33-8517-e19fa06e1a77). I'll get into more why this is the case and why I think it will continue next.

**Why gold should continue to perform well in 2023**?

Too many reasons!

1. **Continued central bank buying**:  When war in Ukraine broke out, the West froze Russia's USD assets. [https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/russian-bank-foreign-reserve-billions-frozen-sanctions-n1292153](https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/russian-bank-foreign-reserve-billions-frozen-sanctions-n1292153)  Any country, that currently aren't simps for the West (China, Russia, India, Middle East, Turkey, South America, etc...) have immediately taken note of this unprecedented action by the west.  If they want to do ANYTHING that may be considered naughty naughty ü§≠ ü§´by the west, they could get their USD assets frozen.  Hence, the frenzy in all of these countries in trying to diversify their reserves away from USD into something else - which one of the new assets they are buying, besides something like the Yuan, is Gold: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-30/russia-to-raise-yuan-share-in-wealth-fund-to-60-gold-to-40?leadSource=uverify%20wall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-30/russia-to-raise-yuan-share-in-wealth-fund-to-60-gold-to-40?leadSource=uverify%20wall)  I see this trend to continue from now until de-globalization reverses, which could be quite a while.  This should prop up gold and other commodity prices.  The US is losing it's grip/influence in a lot of spaces in the world that's not the EU.  Saudi Arabia as an example.
   1. Heck some countries may just want to buy stuff with gold, like Ghana: [https://www.ft.com/content/403e39de-dace-4266-a525-5a36185faa82](https://www.ft.com/content/403e39de-dace-4266-a525-5a36185faa82)
2. **Reaching the terminal rates** :  Often times when rates rise, gold falls.  Yet, rates have risen by so much in 2022 yet gold has maintained it's price.  With the Fed supposedly reaching the end of the rate hikes and inflation supposedly peaking, this catalyst to decrease gold prices will eventually come off the table. [https://fortune.com/2022/12/27/gold-price-rise-2023-outlook-dollar-bitcoin-down/](https://fortune.com/2022/12/27/gold-price-rise-2023-outlook-dollar-bitcoin-down/)
3. **Persistent Inflation**: While inflation is coming down, I truly do believe that the Fed will never hit it's target of 2% inflation, without completely destroying demand and causing the country to enter a deep and tough recession.  I don't see the Fed willing to raise rates so much to do that, partly because of political pressure and partly because that just creates even more issues.  As a reuslt, both demand and supply side dynamics will continue to keep inflation above 2%
   1. **Supply Side Inflation Continues**: Everyone keeps on saying supply side inflation is ""transitory"" is the same dummies that said inflation is ""transitory"".  If the west really wanted to reduce supply side inflation, they would stop fueling the war in Ukraine.  They would stop being anti fossil fuel and anti a lot of things.  That's not ending any time soon, so supply side inflation won't stop.  Additionally, given how the west is so afraid of covid, we could once again see supply side inflation if China unleashes their population to infect the world again, leading to supply chain issues.
   2. **Demand Side Inflation Continues**: Given that the Fed probably won't bring us to a deep and serious recesssion with unemployment spiking over 10% and really crushing the demand side of things, demand will never drop low enough for inflatoin to reach 2%. Additionally, the west likes to fight inflation by handing out more money.  While the Fed can stop printing, like it's been doing, goverments themselves can continue to spend with money they don't have.  California is giving out money to fight inflation: [https://www.kcra.com/article/california-inflation-relief-payments-timeframe-update-1672447464/42371519](https://www.kcra.com/article/california-inflation-relief-payments-timeframe-update-1672447464/42371519).  Same with Spain [https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/spain-announces-106-bln-package-ease-inflation-pain-2023-2022-12-27/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/spain-announces-106-bln-package-ease-inflation-pain-2023-2022-12-27/).  Politicians live for votes, so they will never be aligned with the central bank.  Like any good corporation, they care about lining their pockets now, not necessarily do what's best.  Y**ou and I like free money, so we will never say no when a politician promises us free money for votes.  There's no end to it**.
   3. **TLDR**: Western govs like to induce inflation via their policies such as anti fossile fuel, extending the war in Ukraine, locking stuff down, etc... while handing out stimmies for votes.  The central bank must fight against all that but they can only do so much without causing a real legit recession.
   4. Example: Sellers used to sell 100 widgts and buyers bought 100 widgets.  Now only 50 widgets are availalbe due to supply constraints so the price goes up.  Only 50 widgets are now sold and some people can't afford them so they miss out.  Gov hands out stimmies so now more people can afford the 50 available widgest, so it goes up further in price.
4. **Changing Fed Inflation Target**: If the Fed can't get inflation down to 2%, that will unleash another wave of lack of confidence in the USD and fed, causing real assets to go up again.  And the Fed is already laying the groundwork for this when it realizes in 2-3 years that it can't reach it's 2% goal without causing a real and deep recession.  No one wants to go in depth yet on this stark reality, but the Fed stated in it's most recent meeting that: ""**there may be a longer-run project"" that could take a fresh look at the central bank's inflation goal**. "" [https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2022-12-14/powell-says-fed-will-not-change-2-inflation-goal](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2022-12-14/powell-says-fed-will-not-change-2-inflation-goal).  Some managers are already making this claim - the Fed just has not admit it: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/bill-ackman-says-fed-s-2-inflation-target-no-longer-credible?leadSource=uverify%20wall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/bill-ackman-says-fed-s-2-inflation-target-no-longer-credible?leadSource=uverify%20wall).  Wait for the Fed to admit it and see what happens to commodities...
5. **Debt Ceiling Volatility**: 2023 marks a year where we may have another debt ceiling crisis.  While Reps are not as fiscally conservative as they used to be, they are still 1000% more conservative than Dems these days.  If inflation is still a hot topic, they may be able to rally around being more fiscally conservative, causing a deadlock as they control the House.  Some pundits are saying that this debt ceiling crisis could be as volatilie as the one in 2011 and 1995.  In both of those situations, gold prices popped, i personally have it going up 10% in 1995 and 20% in 2011.  While this is a small move in % terms, with the low implied volatility on gold options, it's a pretty big move within a few months. [https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/economy/debt-ceiling-fight-goldman-sachs/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/economy/debt-ceiling-fight-goldman-sachs/index.html)
6. **Petrogold And Russia**: Similar to how central banks are moving away from the USD, if Russia truly gets desperate in the war in Ukraine, they could do the nuclear option and demand gold for oil/gas.  This scneario is more of a pipe dream that gold bulls like to push and is not covered by main stream media, aka it's more on the conspiracy side of things...but it's not impossible if Putin truly becomes desperate.  [https://www.kitco.com/news/2022-12-07/If-Russia-accepts-gold-for-oil-gold-price-doubles-to-3-600-says-Credit-Suisse-s-Zoltan-Pozsar.html](https://www.kitco.com/news/2022-12-07/If-Russia-accepts-gold-for-oil-gold-price-doubles-to-3-600-says-Credit-Suisse-s-Zoltan-Pozsar.html)
7. **Fed Pivot**: I personally don't see a fed pivot occuring next year given that I don't see inflation going down to 2% and I believe the Fed is going to be cautious so we don't hit a an outright recession.  Most people say fed pivot in 2H 2023, I say 2024-2025.  With that said, the financing market is very tight and MANY of your favorite negative income stocks are going to run out of cash in the next year, likely leading to higher unemployment.  If the Fed were to pivot, and start printing money again, well that'll only lead to an increase in gold prices...again!

&amp;#x200B;

**Why may gold not perform will in 2023**?

* **Demand Side Shock**: Any sort of demand side reduction or crazy drop in inflation, like another covid, could cause a drop in gold prices during the crisis.  However ,the aftermath/money printing and stimulus could cause gold to bounce right back up and higher than it was before.

Maybe the industrial sector can perform decently this year, along with healthcare and consumer staples. All three usually do alright, even when in a recession, which seems to be a matter of when and not an if anymore. The chart setups look alright as well, but I‚Äôll keep that to myself before the ‚ÄúTA is astrology for men‚Äù comments fly in lol.

As far as individual picks go, there are definitely a few companies from the sectors mentioned above that I‚Äôm eyeing to actively trade this year (I trade options mainly), but nothing has caught my attention yet when it comes to starting a swing trade or a long-term investment.

Would love to hear what stocks you‚Äôre eyeing to start building a position with or keep adding when an opportunity presents itself. Of course, if you‚Äôre day trading, I‚Äôll be more than happy to hear what you‚Äôre usually trading and if you‚Äôre adding something new to the list this year.

Bloomberg January 3, 2022

U.S. equities climbed to a record while Treasuries extended losses as traders braced for the start of a potentially volatile year and three expected rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.

The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6%, following stocks in Europe to an all-time high, as trading volume remained light with some markets still closed for holidays. The yield on the U.S. 10-year note rose 13 basis points to 1.64% -- its worst start to a year since 2009 -- and the dollar gained.

‚ÄúBottom line, the outlook is positive for stocks, but the removal of stimulus/accommodation from the global economy is a major theme to watch as we start 2022,‚Äù wrote Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded ‚ÄúThe Sevens Report‚Äù newsletter. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be the first time since 2018 that the Fed is hiking rates, and that change will impact markets throughout the year.‚Äù

Among notable stock moves, Tesla Inc. climbed 14% as the carmaker navigated supply-chain disruptions to report blowout deliveries for the fourth quarter. Apple Inc. gained, giving it a $3 trillion market value. And in Hong Kong, property shares dropped while China Evergrande Group halted trading.

As we flip the calendar over, many of the current market concerns are well known and arguably well priced in at both the index and more prominently at the average stock level,‚Äù wrote Art Hogan, chief markets strategist at National Securities. ‚ÄúWe suggest markets have done an overly efficient job in selling the rumor, and will likely start buying the news.‚Äù",On This Day in History: SP 500 Hits Record High,1672755346

209,StockMarket,"Alleged crypto swindler Sam Bankman-Fried reportedly met with President Biden‚Äôs aides at least four times this year before he was arrested on fraud charges. 

Bankman-Fried took meetings with senior White House advisor Steve Ricchetti on at least three occasions in 2022 and met with the 80-year-old president‚Äôs deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed once in the last year, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. 

The disgraced founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX met with Ricchetti, who serves as a counselor to the president, as recently as Sept. 8, according to Bloomberg. 

Bankman-Fried‚Äôs younger brother Gabriel also reportedly participated in a meeting on May 13.

The report further demonstrates the close political connections Bankman-Fried developed in Washington before.

The Washington Free Beacon reported in November that Bankman-Fried was welcomed to the West Wing for two meetings with Ricchetti on April 22 and May 11.

The former crypto mogul is accused of defrauding investors out of at least $1.8 billion. 

Earlier this month, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to say whether Biden would ask his aides to return 2020 campaign contributions from the accused cryptocurrency con man.

Bankman-Fried, 30, was a major Democratic Party donor before the collapse of FTX, giving $50,000 to the Biden Victory Fund in October 2020 and another $2,800 directly to the Biden campaign that same month, according to Federal Election Commission records.

249,StockMarket,"In this turbulent market environment one stock is standing out very strong to me! It has completed both the technical chart for a Head-and-Shoulders formation (and a head-and-shoulders formation is the most correct chart formations there is. (It completes 85% of its patterns on the positive side). Make sure your looking at the 3 or 5 years chart options. It closed in the spring of 2019 at $62.00 and fell to $63.55 just this past week. That is close enough to complete a pattern... Zoom maybe zooming up these next few months in spite of a bad beat-down coming to many other symbols.

Another reason for my optimism is a fundamental one, or perhaps a geopolitical one. 

The corona-virus is back and is once again quickly blooming! It was headline news for 2 years, but has now been pushed down by the politics of the day...i.e. elections and elections and Trump and civil unrest in the form of theft, as well as many politically motivated crimes.

In spite of these distractions, the hospitals are filling up again (many are already over past extremes). The tens of millions that braved traveling over the holidays are coming home (mostly to the indoors) during this brutal winter siege. It takes two weeks for the infection to disclose itself. During this two week period the Chinese are beginning to come(with the very new variant that has engulfed China these past few months). In spite of these developments, the parade rolls on!

I have a doctors' appointment next week and guess what? It's my first call for ZOOM for over a year.

I live in Florida and the ambulances have started screaming down the boulevards as they haven't done in almost a year. Read the latest news on the Corona-Virus and skip the headline news for a moment.

If you think the hospitals are full now wait until the Chinese masses hit California with the new template many of them will surely have in them. I hope not. The dots, however, are beginning to connect for me as few stocks have in my  past thirty-five years of trading.

Do I think that Zoom will once again elevate itself to a $500+ stock as it was very recently. I doubt that, but I think and feel and smell that this stock, with all that's coming down the pike, can make a stab at the $140--$150 area over the next six months. Only my opinion, though I think the gods will be dancing !!! Best of luck to you.

290,StockMarket,[removed],Indices,1672667847
291,StockMarket,"**Tim Draper: $250,000**

Bitcoin bull Tim Draper had one of the most optimistic calls on bitcoin of 2022, predicting the token would be worth $250,000 by the end of the year.

In November, the billionaire venture capitalist said he‚Äôs extending the timeline for that prediction until mid-2023. Even after the collapse of FTX, he‚Äôs convinced the coin will hit the quarter-of-a-million milestone.

‚ÄúMy assumption is that since women control 80% of retail spending, and only 1 in 7 bitcoin wallets are currently held by women that the dam is about to break,‚Äù Draper told CNBC via email.

Bitcoin would need to rally 1,400% in order for it to trade at that level.

Despite the depressed prices and trading volumes drying up, there could be reason to suspect the market has found a bottom, according to Draper.

‚ÄúI suspect that the halvening in 2024 will have a positive run,‚Äù he said.

The halvening, or halving, is an event that happens every four years in which bitcoin rewards to miners are cut in half. This is viewed by some investors as positive for bitcoin‚Äôs price, as it squeezes supply. The next halving is slated to happen sometime in 2024.

Bitcoin miners, who use power-intensive machines to verify transactions and mint new tokens, are being squeezed by the slump in prices and rising energy costs.

These actors accumulate massive piles of digital currency, making them some of the biggest sellers in the market. With miners offloading their holdings to pay off debts, that should remove most of the remaining selling pressure on bitcoin.

That‚Äôs historically a good sign for bitcoin, said Vijay Ayyar, vice president of corporate development at crypto exchange Luno.

‚ÄúIn prior down markets, miner capitulation has usually indicated major bottoms,‚Äù Ayyar told CNBC. ‚ÄúTheir cost to produce becomes greater than the value of bitcoin, hence you have a number of miners either switching off their machines ‚Ä¶ or they need to sell more bitcoin to keep their business afloat.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf the market reaches a point where it‚Äôs absorbing this miner sell pressure sufficiently, one can assume that we‚Äôre seeing a bottoming period.‚Äù

**Standard Chartered: $5,000**

For some market participants, the worst is yet to come.

In a Dec. 5 research note, Standard Chartered said bitcoin may sink as low as $5,000. The prediction, one of the bank‚Äôs list of ‚Äúsurprises‚Äù that are being ‚Äúunder-priced‚Äù by markets, would represent a 70% plunge from current prices.

‚ÄúYields plunge along with technology shares‚Äù in Standard Chartered‚Äôs nightmare 2023 scenario, ‚Äúand while the Bitcoin sell-off decelerates, the damage has been done,‚Äù said Eric Robertsen, the bank‚Äôs global head of research.

‚ÄúMore and more crypto firms and exchanges find themselves with insufficient liquidity, leading to further bankruptcies and a collapse in investor confidence in digital assets,‚Äù he added.

Robertsen said the scenario has a ‚Äúnon-zero probability of occurring in the year ahead‚Äù and falls ‚Äúmaterially outside of the market consensus or our own baseline views.‚Äù

**Mark Mobius: $10,000**

Veteran investor Mark Mobius had a relatively successful 2022 in terms of his price call. In May, he forecast bitcoin would drop to $20,000 when it was trading above $28,000.

He said bitcoin would fall to $10,000 in 2022. That did not happen. However, Mobius told CNBC that he is sticking for his $10,000 price call in 2023.

The investor, who made his name at Franklin Templeton Investments, told CNBC that his bear case for bitcoin stemmed from rising interest rates and general tighter monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

‚ÄúWith higher interest rates, the attraction of holding or buying Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies becomes less attractive since just holding the coin does not pay interest,‚Äù Mobius said via email.

**Carol Alexander: $50,000**

Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, wasn‚Äôt far off the mark with her prediction that bitcoin would slip to $10,000 in 2022.

Now, she thinks the cryptocurrency could be set for gains ‚Äî but not for reasons you might expect.

The catalyst would be more dominos from the FTX fallout tipping over, Alexander said. If this happens, she expects the price of bitcoin will top $30,000 in the first quarter, and then $50,000 by quarters three or four.

‚ÄúThere will be a managed bull market in 2023, not a bubble ‚Äî so we won‚Äôt see the price overshooting as before,‚Äù she told CNBC.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see a month or two of stable trending prices interspersed with range-bounded periods and probably a couple of short-lived crashes.‚Äù

Alexander‚Äôs reasoning is that, with trading volumes evaporating with traders on edge, large holders known as ‚Äúwhales‚Äù will likely step in to prop up the market. The wealthiest 97 bitcoin wallet addresses account for 14.15% of the total supply, according to fintech firm River Financial.

In many ways I had my most disciplined year as an investor, and I was able to stick to DCA in major indexes with occasional margin leverage and crypto trading mixed in.  But I kept the speculative stuff at a small % of overall portfolio which is better than my past stock-picking and day trading.

Anyway I‚Äôm proud that I stuck with my thesis and asset allocations even when I was seeing red.  I was more patient this year than in the past.

Lastly:  Muck Fusk!  Back when I tried to pick individual stocks rather than DCA indexes, I rode TSLA from 2010-20, then sold it all 100% because of Musks erratic behavior.  So much potential lost because of his ego.  (See FSD)

I still think we should keep an eyes on this things, maybe more stimulus will come on board, however many economist are saying this will still make inflation go up, i dont see much impact of this on the demand side, however the supply side is very less, and yet the spending is still high, so they might be right but i think its not the case, also one of the Bills passed is the AID for Ukraine, at some point we could see the war between Russia and Ukraine stop, due to the constant backings from the US, as we all know this War  between Russia and Ukraine has been part of the reason the market dropped, my major fear now is that the Dollars might keep dropping as we see Russia and China trying to pull out of the $ which is the Global reserve, this was as a result of the freezing of Russia accounts,  if this happens  Dxy will drop hard, and one of the means to send the dollar up is to hike rates, they did this before will they do it again?? we cant tell but watch all these macro indicators, and see what comes in the first quarter of 2023, i somehow think we are likely to get a recession.",Biden administration $1.7trillion bill,1672609857

I have managed my own portfolio for 3 years and 2 months now with a return of 22% on a total of 43 trades. I have recently moved to solely options in the past 11 months. on the 21st will be a full year with the account netting a profit of 43%. I am psychopathic when it comes to money and stocks as I have realized my potential. I have adopted this crazy money driven mindset in the past year where all I think about is money and dedicate about 6 hrs a day to the market. I don't value school as I am a junior and the only class I take that I value is my AP Econ class. I have a 50 year personalized flow chart till I plan to retire at about 65. I caddie at a very prestigious golf club where I interact with very many high profile individuals and have two possible internships lined up this summer because of people I have met and connections I have made (I caddie literally 1-2 times every single day in the summer). It sounds crazy but I have everything planned down to the year. I have very many possibilities in the sector though. I feel I will most likely go to college for Finance, hop around a bit with a firm, until I eventually start my own hedge fund (it will happen). I believe the connections I have made and will continue to make will provide very generous seed funding for my plan and I believe as I have only known trading in the bear market, I will succeed even more in the bull. If anyone out there has a similar mindset, experience, and can give me any advice on what you did or what happened to you I would greatly appreciate it. I will also note that I am the 2022 Huntington stock market champion (out of over 5000 teenagers) and am leading this years competition with a current portfolio value of $155,000 while 2nd place is $120,000 as an appeal to credibility.

The value of a company is the present value of discounted future cash flows, and analyst consensus compiled by FactSet indicates that Tesla is expected to take the lead in cash flow in the automotive industry in 2023. Tesla has been growing their free cash flow at a rapid clip (from $1B in 2019, to $2.8B in 2020, to $5B in 2021), and is expected to continue to grow to $23.6B free cash flow by 2027 with sales of around 3.3 million automobiles (compared $10B free cash flow on 1.3 million units in 2022) as well as car software, car insurance, car service, car charging, and energy products. Meanwhile, the other automakers free cash flow is mostly stagnant, and is expected to decline as they are required to make large investments to catch up on EVs trends while selling EVs at slim and even negative profit margins. Simultaneously, rising EV adoption may cause significant declines in residual values for gasoline powered cars, and imperil the previously very profitable blue chip financing arms of major automakers.

335,StockMarket,"**2023 PREDICTIONS:**

**SPY Best -- 431SPY Mid -- 318SPY Worst -- 273**

**QQQ Best -- 335QQQ Mid -- 211QQQ Worst -- 165**

**IWM Best -- 216IWM Mid -- 152IWM Worst -- 141**

^(Best = Highest level I could see the index hitting if it breaks out early from its bear channel)  
^(Mid = Most likely low before the index goes sideways/consolidates out of its bear channel)  
^(Worst = Lowest level I could see the index hitting if price collapses below its bear channel)

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**:  Price is decidedly in a descending, bearish channel since breaking down from ATHs in late 2021/early 2022.  This channel has been tested 3x thus far in 2022 without any sign of its upper TL weakening; however, the steep descending angle is likely not sustainable for the entirity of 2023.  Therefore, the first support level which could give the pivot/bounce which truly tests this bear channel is likely 339.08 the pre-COVID pivot high.

However, if this level fails to give a sufficient-enough bounce, then a nearby level at 321.28 is a retrace area from the COVID V-shape breakout.  The 318 - 321 level is fascinating, because it not only includes that aforementioned retrce level, but is also near the 61.8% Fib retrace (318.24) from the 2020 COVID low to 2022 ATH -- and urthermore -- this level will coincidentally intersect the upper TL of our bearish channel in mid-to-late 2023 if price cannot challenge (or potentially breakout) beforehand.  And as if that was not enough, also coming together at this mid-to-end of 2023 intersection point is another major support level: the ascending TL which formed off the 2008-2009 financial crisis pivot low, which is a level only pierced during COVID.

If price falls at the fastest rate its current channel predicts, and in doing so cuts right through all of those major support factors before mid-2023, then price will hit another major support level at 305.70 the ascending TL off the 2008-2009 financial crisis.  And if price just utterly collapses in 2023, then the final major support level I could see it reaching in 2023 is at 273.50 where the current descending support TL from the January 2022 pivot ATH will cross the 2007 pre-financial crisis pivot ATH...this TL is also where price retraced in 2019 and 2020.

On the more positive side -- if the bounce which comes off one of those support levels breaks through the bear channel, and on a retest of that channel TL we see even more upside, then the max upside I could see hitting this year is 431.73 where the floor (now ceiling) was put in from September 2021 to June 2022.  Reaching this level would require price to breakout through those multiple pivot highs which previously tested the bear channel's upper TL; therefore, what could be more likely on the ""bull"" side of the market is a choppy year which consolidates at-then-through those now-resistance levels.

https://preview.redd.it/vkwuphwfvf9a1.jpg?width=2296&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad93d7760d3448e39301f3408031feba8c63f89b

**QQQ**:  Compared to the S&amp;P and Russell, the NASDAQ experienced a more parabolic rise -- and as a result -- has fallen at a faster rate.  The NASDAQ already bounced 1x off the 61.8% Fib retrace from the COVID-low to the November 2021 ATHs; therefore, I do not expect this level will provide long term support in 2023, e.g. the momentum needed to breakout of its bear channel.

The nearest level of support which could give this type of bounce may be the confluence between  234.93 the pre-COVID pivot high, and an ascending TL off the 2007-2008 financial crisis pivot highs (which, coincidentally, is currently within the bear channel and cutting through the pre-COVID high level).  Depending on the QQQ's rate of descent, these 2x support levels will intersect with the current upper TL of the bear channel in mid-to-late 2023, much like certain intersections on the SPY chart.  All of that said, I still do not believe this will be the pivot low in 2023; instead, I believe the QQQ needs to retest at least 225.88 the 75% Fib retrace, but more likely 211.71 where price pierced/retraced during the COVID V-shape recovery.  Interestingly, these 2x more practical levels (to me anyway) are scheduled to intersect the bear channel's upper TL in late-2023.

However, when you look at just how much the QQQ has risen compared to IWM or SPY, it does seem conceivable that price could do a full 100% retrace of 164.93 the COVID-lows...

On the more positive side -- if the bounce which comes off one of those support levels breaks through the bear channel, and on a retest of that channel TL we see even more upside, then the max upside I could see hitting this year is 315.59 the 31.8% Fib retrace level up to 334.42 where price pierced that Fib level during the past year's decline.  Reaching this level would require price to breakout through multiple pivot highs which previously tested the bear channel's upper TL; therefore, what could be more likely on the ""bull"" side of the market is a choppy year which consolidates at-then-through those now-resistance levels.

https://preview.redd.it/uwe291phvf9a1.jpg?width=2300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e24b51bec09e568f352e7355adff7425d66a74c4

**IWM**:  Compared to the S&amp;P, the Russell is closer to the same type of major support levels; for example, the SPY is testing its 31.8% Fib retrace vs the IWM testing its 50% Fib retace.  And yet unlike the NASDAQ (which is testing its 61.8% Fib retrace vs the Russell's 50% Fib), the Russell did not experience the same parabolic climb to ATHs; therefore, the NASDAQ should be expected to be seeing a bigger pull back.  As a result, IWM may be a leading indicator during 2023 in terms of when the bottom is put in across all 3x major indices...assuming the bottom comes as part of a more natural market cycle (e.g. grinding lower to a definitive pivot point, then turning higher) than a 'flash event' (e.g. similar to what we see looking back at COVID).

The nearest major support level is 162.76 triple bottom, and while this level is being bolstered by an ascending support TL coming off the 2008-2009 financial crisis pivot low, the macro consolidation which has occurred at/near these levels since mid-2022 is enough to make me question is either level will give the IWM enough momentum to break out of its bear channel.  Instead, I believe a more likely level to challenge the bear channel will come around 152 where price pivoted &amp; retraced during the COVID V-shape recovery, as well as the 61.8% Fib retrace from the 2020 COVID low to November 2021 ATH (as mentioned, QQQ already retraced to its 61.8% Fib level).  If this level cannot at least shift the IWM into sideways chop/consolidation out of the bear channel, then the lowest point from a technical perspective in 2023 could be 141 - 145 where the current resistance descending TL intersects with an ascending TL from the 2008 pre-financial crisis pivot high to a retrace from the 2018 pivot low.

On the more positive side -- if price can breakout of the bear channel &amp; then retest the channel's upper TL, the max upside could be 216 which is where the floor (now ceiling) was put in from January 2021 to January 2022.  However &amp; similar to SPY &amp; IWM, to reach this level would require moves that breakout through 2x major ascending resistance TLs.  Instead, a more likely ""bullish"" case could be sideways chop/consolidation at-and-through these levels.

359,StockMarket," This is my plan and should not be traded by anyone but me. Markets are closed Monday 1/2/23.

***Recap***: Markets provided some New Year‚Äôs fireworks on the final trading day of 2022, with the S&amp;P futures moving up 40 points in the final hour of trading on Friday and into the runoff period. Unsurprisingly, markets were largely in balance over the Christmas holiday and intervening week into the new year. From December 16 through the 30th, markets mostly drifted between **3808** and **3883**, indicating a market that is in balance; both buyers and sellers agree on value.

***Balance/Trend***: Though the market is currently in balance, we have to consider both bigger trends at play: there was a clean down trend for the 2022 bear market and a similarly clean trend up since October.

***Analysis***: Contraction in markets leads to expansion, and the market‚Äôs recent sluggishness during the holidays should lead to more explosive movement soon. The decrease in volatility is shown by the white wedge in the chart, which gives breakout levels to each side of it at **3870** and **3820**. 

The bullish trend is intact as long as **3820** holds, and just below that is the **3808** level where the balance zone low is found. These two supports are confluent with the white triangle support as well, and as usual, support is not an exact price level, but a zone that uses these two levels.

We also need to consider what happened for all of November and a good bit of December: the market was broadly balanced between **3920** and **4040**. After finally breaking down below **3920** on 12/16, the market retested this level on 12/21 and rejected it. 

***Plan***:

* As mentioned, **3820** is an important support in the bull trend and must be held. I like to see the market test below it, perhaps as low as the **3808** level and recapture it for a long targeting **3857** and **3870-77**. 
* If we get a stronger move that breaks out cleanly from the **3870** above the triangle, there‚Äôs a good chance that the market will attempt to break back into **3920**. If the market is able to move inside, we could potentially see some consolidation around **3927**, the 12/10 weekly vPOC, as the market sees if there is acceptance back inside this range. 
* A sustained move into the balance range should test **3951** before buyers will need to break into time value from the week of 12/10. I would try longs on a break through and backtest of the level.
* The market remains in the wedge, coiling further, below **3880**. If the market attempts to break out of the wedge and comes back inside the **3870-3873** range (weekly volume value high), then I would attempt a short targeting **3852-57** and **3820**.
* If the market finds resistance at **3920** on another retest there, this could be a good short for me targeting a backtest of the wedge at **3870-77**. 

If the market moves down next week, then I would look for shorts below **3820**. However, I would cut early if there‚Äôs not a good, clean trend down. I would want to see the market clear **3808** for confirmation, and in a short trade, I would target **3764** and **3752**.

# **Stocks fall to end Wall Street‚Äôs worst year since 2008, S&amp;P 500 finishes 2022 down nearly 20% - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks slipped on Friday to end a brutal 2022 with a whimper, as Wall Street wrapped up its worst year since 2008 on a sour note.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 73.55 points, or 0.22%, to close at 33,147.25. The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.25% to end at 3,839.50. The Nasdaq Composite ticked down 0.11% to 10,466.88.
*****
&gt; Friday marked the final day of trading in what has been a painful year for stocks. All three of the major averages suffered their worst year since 2008 and snapped a three-year win streak. The Dow fared the best of the indexes in 2022, down about 8.8%. The S&amp;P 500 sank 19.4%, and is more than 20% below its record high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 33.1%.
*****
&gt; Sticky inflation and aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve battered growth and technology stocks and weighed on investor sentiment throughout the year. Geopolitical concerns and volatile economic data also kept markets on edge.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had everything from Covid problems in China to the invasion of Ukraine. They‚Äôve all been very serious. But for investors, it is what the Fed is doing,‚Äù said Art Cashin, director of floor operations for UBS, on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Exchange.‚Äù
*****
&gt; As the calendar turns to a new year, some investors think the pain is far from over. They expect the bear market to persist until a recession hits or the Fed pivots. Some also project stocks will hit new lows before rebounding in the second half of 2023.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI would love to tell you that it is going to be like the ‚ÄòWizard of Oz‚Äô and everything is going to be in glorious color in a moment or two. I think we may have a bumpy first quarter, and depending on the Fed it may last a little longer than that,‚Äù Cashin said.
*****
&gt; Despite the yearly losses, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 did break three-quarter losing streaks in the final three months of the year. The Nasdaq, however, dominated by the likes of Apple, Tesla and Microsoft, muddled through its fourth consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2001. All three averages are negative for December, however.
*****
&gt; Communication services was the worst performing sector in the S&amp;P 500 this year, falling more than 40%, followed by consumer discretionary. Energy was the only sector to rise, climbing 59%.

&gt; # One Year's Loss Is Not the Next Year's Gain

&gt; It's finally the last trading day of what has been a tough year for most asset classes, especially equities. As of this writing, the S&amp;P 500 is on pace to finish the year with a 19.83% loss. Over the course of the index's history, there have only been nine other years in which the S&amp;P 500 has fallen at least 15% for the full year. Of course, turning the page of the calendar does not mean all the issues dragging stocks lower magically go away, and a big decline one year does not in and of itself mean we're due for a big gain the next year.

&gt; In the chart below we plot the annual percentage change of the S&amp;P 500 versus its move the following year. Taking a linear regression shows that performance one year is not a good explainer for next-year performance with a miniscule R squared of 0.0003. Looking just at those years where the S&amp;P fell 15%+, five times the index posted gains the next year, while four times the index posted further declines.

&gt; # Let‚Äôs Look at Stocks Down Two Years in A Row

&gt; As bad as 2022 has been for investors, there is a silver lining: back-to-back declines in the S&amp;P 500 are rarer than you may think.

&gt; If you go all the way back to 1950, the only times that stocks fell in back-to-back years were during the vicious recession of 1973/1974 and then three years in a row during the tech bubble implosion of the early 2000s. Fortunately, we don‚Äôt see similar scenarios within the current environment, so I think the odds could favor a snapback in 2023.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-193.png))**

&gt; Taking a closer look into the data, we found:

&gt; * The year after, a negative return saw the S&amp;P 500 up 15% on average and higher 80% of the time.
&gt; *A 10% (or greater) loss showed the following year up only 8.5% on average and higher 63.6% of the time.
&gt; *Out of the 20 negative years, only three times did returns get worse the following year (in 1974, 2001, and 2002).
&gt; *However, the following year, significant losses were rewarded as 20% or more declines saw the next year higher all three times and up 27.1% on average (in 1975, 2003, and 2009).
&gt; *Somewhat surprising to me is the year after a positive year, the returns were only 7.1% on average and higher 68.6% of the time. Take note that the average year since 1950 gained 9.5% and was higher 71.2% of the time.

&gt; # What Happens When Everyone Agrees That Stocks Will Fall?

&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what you look at that matters; it‚Äôs what you see.‚Äù Henry David Thoreau

&gt; I‚Äôve done this for more than two decades, and I have to say, the general consensus remains that the first half of next year will be rough for stocks, while the second half of the year should be better. But let‚Äôs be clear, overall, the general consensus is that next year will be rough for investors (as we explained here).

&gt; The last time I can recall everyone agreeing on something like this was in 2012 and the fiscal cliff drama. Seriously, it is all anyone talked about in the second half of 2012, and the big worry was that it would wreak havoc on stocks and the economy in the first half of 2013 and beyond. Guess what happened? Stocks soared nearly 30% in 2013, and the economy did just fine.

&gt; You see, the stock market is always pricing things in, and if everyone is talking about it, you better believe the stock market is aware. As Lou Holtz once said, ‚ÄúLife is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you respond to it.‚Äù We are in the midst of one of the worst years ever for investors, and the general consensus is that next year will be bad, also. So the question is, how are we supposed to respond to this?

&gt; What amazes me is how bearish everyone is. Yet, we have inflation coming down very quickly, an economy (while notably slowing, for sure) that we believe is not likely to be headed to a recession (in part, thanks to a very strong consumer), and some of the historically best times to invest based on the calendar.

&gt; That‚Äôs right, the first quarter in a pre-election year has been positive an incredible 17 out of 18 times going back to 1950. Oh, it was also up 7.4% on average (the very best quarter out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle). On top of that, the second quarter has also performed quite well, too. So, we potentially have an interesting situation brewing here, and I sure don‚Äôt hear too many people pointing out any of the more optimistic news or perspectives.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/spx-quarterly-returns.png))**

&gt; Now go back to the quote at the very beginning about what you look at versus what you see. To me, I look at all the worries and concerns as everyone else, but what I see is the potential for a surprise rally that not many are expecting.

&gt; # 2022 Solidified as the Worst Year for Sentiment

&gt; As we noted in an earlier post, today's release of the AAII survey gives us the final reading of the year on sentiment, solidifying a number of points as to just how dour the investor outlook has been.

&gt; For starters, the bull-bear spread heavily favors bears, and that has been the case for some time now. As shown below, the spread has been negative (meaning a higher share of respondents are reporting as bearish than bullish) for a record 39 weeks in a row- over a month longer than the previous record which occurred recently in 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-3a.png))**

&gt; Across all weeks in 2022, bullish sentiment averaged a reading of merely 24.73%. Since the survey began in 1987, that is a record low. In fact, the previous lowest readings were a few percentage points higher at 27.29% and 27.08% in 1988 and 1990, respectively. Meanwhile, the average reading on bearish sentiment was historically elevated at a record of 46.2%, surpassing the prior record set in 2008 by one percentage point. Prior to 2008/2009, only 1990 saw a very high average reading for bearish sentiment.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-Year-1.png))**

&gt; As we highlighted in an earlier tweet, given the low readings on bullish sentiment, there was not even a single week this year in which bullish sentiment came in above its historical average of 37.63%. Of course with a low share of survey respondents reporting as bullish, a larger share would be reporting as bearish. To match the impressive reading with no weeks seeing above-average bullish sentiment, nearly every week this year (51) has seen bearish sentiment come in above its historical average of 31%, tying the record high set in 2009.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-Year-3.png))**

&gt; As previously mentioned, bullish sentiment averaged a reading below 25% this year. Given that reading, it should come as no surprise that 2022 also saw a record number of weeks (30) with bulls below 25%. Prior to this year, 1988 (one year after the survey began) was the prior record at 23 weeks. In other words, this year there were nearly two months more in which less than a quarter of investors reported as bullish than the previous record. Additionally, there had been 17 weeks in which over half of the responses were bearish. Similar to the number of weeks in which bearish sentiment was above average, that ties 2008 for the record high.

&gt; # Grinch visits Wall Street on Last Trading Day of Year

&gt; Last-minute tax-loss selling, old sayings such as ‚Äúyear ends make great exits,‚Äù a desire to start with a clean slate, who knows exactly the answer, but the last trading day of the year has turned bearish over the last twenty-two years. Since 2000, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have the worst records. On the last trading day of the year, NASDAQ has been down in sixteen of the last twenty-two years after having been up twenty-nine years in a row from 1971 to 1999. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have also been struggling recently and exhibit a bearish bias over the last twenty-two years. Russell 2000‚Äôs record very closely resembles NASDAQ, gains every year from 1979 to 1999 and only six advances since.

&gt; # Country ETFs in 2022

&gt; Earlier today we published our Global Macro Dashboard which provides an overview of the main economic and market data of 22 major global economies. In the table below, we show the recent performance of the ETFs tracking those same countries.

&gt; With 2022 drawing to a close, there are only two countries that are currently in the green for the year: Brazil (EWZ) and Mexico (EWW). Neither are up much, but up is up, especially in a year like this one.

&gt; In terms of month-to-date change, Hong Kong (EWH) has risen the most with a 5.62% gain, while China (MCHI) is up a modest 0.46%. On the other end of the spectrum, Taiwan (EWT) has fallen sharply with an over 20% decline, but most of that drop is actually due to a $5.18/share long-term capital gain that the fund paid out earlier this month.

&gt; # Pre-Election Year Januarys Stellar - #1 S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, #2 DJIA

&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations has historically propelled stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but sixth on the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA since 1950. January is the last month of the best three-consecutive-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.

&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2022 as both indices suffered losses in thirteen of those twenty-three Januarys with three in a row in: 2008 to 2010, 2014 to 2016 and then again from 2020 to 2022. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1930 respectively. Covid-19 spoiled January in 2020 &amp; 2021 as DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all suffered declines in 2020. In 2021, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 declined. In 2022, surging inflation, reaching multi-decade highs, stoked fears of substantially higher interest rates in January.

&gt; However, in pre-election years, Januarys have been outright stellar ranking #1 for S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 and #2 for DJIA. Average gains range from 3.4% by Russell 1000 to a whopping 6.8% for NASDAQ. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have only declined twice in pre-election Januarys, 2015 and 2003.

&gt; # Falling FAANG+

&gt; Yesterday Amazon (AMZN) became the third of the mega-cap FAANG+ stocks (along with META and NFLX) to close below its closing low made during the COVID Crash in March 2020. Not only have all of AMZN's post-pandemic gains been erased, but it's now trading below its lowest close made during the COVID Crash!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/amznchart.png))**

&gt; NYSE's FAANG+ index is described as an index of ""10 of today's highly-traded tech giants."" Given that most of the FAANG+ stocks account for a massive portion of the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500, they are an impactful group. As shown below, the FAANG+ index peaked in early November last year and has dropped 46% since then. The drop more recently follows a failed breakout above the top of its downtrend channel as the index is now back to within 5% of this past November's low. On a relative basis, the group has been underperforming the broader market for even longer with a high in February of last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122822-FAANG-1.png))**

&gt; Below is a look at the ten FAANG+ stocks. As shown, they came into the year with a combined market cap of $12.3 trillion, and they're ending the year with a combined market cap of just over $7 trillion. While Apple (AAPL) has fallen the least YTD in terms of share price change, it has lost the most in market cap at $844 billion. Amazon (AMZN) has seen its market cap fall the second-most at $843 billion, essentially getting cut in half. Tesla (TSLA), along with AMZN, is one of two names that lost their ""$1 trillion market cap"" club status this year. TSLA is now down 69% on the year, and its market cap has fallen from $1.06 trillion down to just $344 billion. The other FAANG+ stocks that are down 50%+ on the year include Meta (META), NVIDIA (NVDA), Netflix (NFLX), AMD, and Snowflake (SNOW).

&gt; With markets continuing to drop in these final trading days of December, on an absolute basis, 2022 is going to go down as the biggest year of wealth destruction ever for the US equity market. In 2008, the Russell 3,000 saw its market cap fall by $6.7 trillion. As of today, the Russell 3,000's market cap has fallen about $11.2 trillion so far in 2022. $5.2 trillion of that $11.2 trillion decline has come from just the ten FAANG+ stocks shown below.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

**The Strategy**

My strategy is based upon a concentrated value investing approach. I like to perform deep fundamental research to find and buy a stake in companies that I find value in. I like to hold 12 to 15 stocks diversified among various industries to diversify against any black swan events. This strategy offers my portfolio enough downside protection while also leaving enough room for my best ideas to play out. I protect the portfolio from serious losses by performing deep fundamental research and by using a margin of safety, not by avoiding or minimizing volatility. I see stocks as parts of businesses and analyze and value them according to that principle. This includes both buying low and buying the companies with a high discount to their intrinsic value. When you minimize losses and allocate capital when the odds are in your favor, you don‚Äôt lose and when you win, you win big. That is the backbone of a concentrated value approach.

I do not hold restrictions on portfolio management and can allocate a larger part of my portfolio to one or several stocks. I furthermore do not yield any restrictions to potential investments. Such restrictions harm the ability to invest freely and to fully deploy my strategy and can even diminish performance. This includes market caps, industries, ESG restrictions, portfolio sizes, number of stocks and country of origin. I hold 12-15 stocks because I like it that way, it leaves enough room for opportunities while making sure you deeply understand both your investments and your entire portfolio. I allocate capital based upon a risk/reward scenario whereas all positions (and sizes) are constructed according to that principle. If the numbers are simply too good, I may allocate more capital to that opportunity, certainly if the risk is contained or minimized towards the downside. 

**Volatility**

Basic mathematical principles tell us that to maximize our upside returns, firstly we need to minimize the downside as lost dollars are harder to replace (i.e. a 33% drop needs a 50% gain to breakeven). I do not hedge the portfolio with various instruments as hedging is surrendering towards the idea that you are unsure about your portfolio and individual positions. I hold securities and maintain a decent cash position to allocate capital to various opportunities presented by the market without the need to sell off other positions. Trying to avoid losses is done by deeply fundamental research and buying stocks cheaply and not by hedging your uncertain positions by buying various financial instruments. One could argue that buying dollar bills for 50 cents and therefore stocks that are cheaply priced towards their intrinsic value is all the hedging an equity portfolio requires.

I do not think that volatility is related to risk or risk of losses and the portfolio is therefore not constructed to minimize volatility. Each investor should understand that a concentrated value approach yields an above average high level of volatility and should not confuse volatility with risk (as is common in modern day finance). Again, risk is minimized not through building statistical models regarding volatility but rather through respectful and deep business evaluation and research. Traditional risk management considers beta, also known as market risk, as a measure of volatility or systematic risk of an individual stock in comparison to the entire market. According to that idea, risk management would therefore be appropriate to diversify in a lot of stocks to smooth out volatility and still be rewarded with an appropriate return. If you include enough stocks to eventually resemble the index volatility, then your returns will eventually resemble the index that you are so desperately trying to beat and doom yourself to mediocre performance. Deep business evaluation and research is ought to be useless as the efficient market assigns the correct values to all businesses. The entire finance industry operates mainly to the same models and therefore increases the volatility and opportunities presented by the market, so volatility can also be a tool to buy a good stock for a high discount relative to its intrinsic value.

**Warren Buffet:** ""The riskiness of an investment is not measured by beta (a Wall Street term encompassing volatility and often used in measuring risk) but rather by the probability of that investment causing its owner a loss of purchasing power over his contemplated holding period. Assets can fluctuate greatly in price and not be risky as long as they are reasonably certain to deliver increased purchasing power over their holding period."" (2011)

**The Portfolio**

I try to stay away from the most popular stock in the most popular industry. I do not assign any indicative value towards securities other than the value I find in them by performing deep fundamental research. I do not allocate capital towards businesses simply because they are popular, well-known, would make the portfolio look great on paper or are fun to talk about on your nephew‚Äôs birthday party. Peter Lynch prefers to avoid the hottest stock in the hottest industry; stocks that are heralded as the next big something; longshot companies at the cusp of solving the latest national problem; and stocks with the most exciting name. He also dislikes whisper stocks that attract imaginative, complicated, and emotionally appealing stories. Stocks that receive significant positive attention have greater risk of being over-bought and over-priced. High growth businesses in popular industries with low barrier to entry attracts a lot of competition and imitation. I tend to agree with him.

To the contrary, my strategy may well be exactly the opposite: I try to find beaten down unpopular undervalued stocks in disfavored industries. For these stocks the downward risk most of the times already happened, there is high emotion involved and some stories are not fully understood. These turnaround stories also have the highest potential for increases in returns. I focus on companies based upon EV/EBITDA ratio since I believe that to be a better measure of profitability and the value assigned to a company. I furthermore focus on free cash flow as that provides businesses opportunities to deploy their capital and achieve shareholder returns. I like companies that are buying back shares and have management that is shareholder friendly oriented. I furthermore like ''rare bird'' stocks that offer special stories and opportunities such as spinoffs, asset plays, arbitrage opportunities and turnarounds because of the asymmetric risk/reward ratio involved. Some companies are so cheaply priced that there seems almost no further downside risk to that specific scenario. I furthermore like companies with recent catalysts that would make it hard to analyze and value the company correctly such as mergers, scandals or trouble, therefore creating opportunities for the observant investor. I calculate and adjust the financial statements to recent situations to derive at my fair value of the company which most of the time is not in line with the price attached to the company by the market.  

I hold my positions for the long term if the fundamentals of the stock stay the same or improve. I sell when my profit target (value) is reached. Although my potential profit could be higher when I hold on just a little longer, in the entire history of humanity, no one has ever gone broke taking profits. If the company does change fundamentally or they don‚Äôt show good prospects, I close the position and look for new opportunities. Investing requires both ‚Äò‚Äôscience and art‚Äô‚Äô from the individual investor to form his qualified opinion and specific investment actions. The more qualitative ‚Äòart‚Äô of investing is hard to explicitly state on paper and although I love to elaborate further about the portfolio selection criteria, I think those are best explained below by the current holdings in our portfolio.

**2023 Outlook**

The past year saw a moderate decline in stock prices and the market decline has created greater opportunities among undervalued situations with positive long-term outlook for potential returns. I specifically use the word ‚Äòmoderate‚Äô since casual reading of recent media outlets would suggest that the decline is much greater. One could argue to be ‚Äògreedy when others are fearful‚Äô as we saw a lot of fear in the market in the past year. This does not, however, suggest that the market is unable to decline more and create both further investment losses and bargain situations in the stock market. As I do not attempt to forecast stock prices in the short or medium term, I have no idea whether broad market indexes will rise, fall or go sideways for the upcoming year, period or decade. Although past performance is no guarantee for future results, it is a rather useful indicator because the one constant in financial markets is human nature and human nature can be highly emotional, volatile and irrational. If you would compare the 2022 bear market with historical bear markets this would suggest more pain ahead but then again the economic situation and outlook may well be different from those economic situations in the past that accompanied historic market drawdowns.

I do think that the short-term outlook is rather negative across financial markets and that such negative outlooks in the past have been good moments for opportunities in the markets. I furthermore think that our portfolio is well suited for potential long-term returns and potential short-term volatility.  We hold a decent cash allocation in the portfolio to buy a) any of the undervalued opportunities Mr. Market presents to us or b) to increase our positions in our current holdings. 

I do not pretend to be able to predict market movements in the short-term and would feel that any energy used in this endeavor would take energy away from my main tasks. I rather spend my energy looking at the investment opportunities not the condition of the general market itself. That will be our 2023 strategy. Please consider that our concentrated equity portfolio is one of high volatility and act accordingly. I personally have invested a large part of my net worth in the Fund and I hold no other equity securities. My entire professional focus is in this Eurykleia Fund and I therefore believe our goals and returns to be aligned. 

**Our Current Portfolio**

Our portfolio currently consists of 12 marketable securities that are discussed in more detail individually below. I believe all holdings to be undervalued and for that reason have included them in the portfolio. Traditional risk management would suggest that our portfolio contains a high level of risk since it is not diversified into many stocks. In fact, traditional risk management is right in the fact that this portfolio has a high level of market volatility but is wrong in assuming that volatility is in any way related to risk. I do not include company A because I also hold company B and consequently pretend that that addition to the portfolio would in any way decrease the portfolio risk of serious investment losses. To the contrary, adding various random businesses without the deep fundamental research required upfront just for the sake of ‚Äòdiversification‚Äô would only worsen the portfolio outlook and increase the risk of serious losses. 

The portfolio is structured and prepared for a wide variety of potential economic situations in the upcoming year. All of our holdings are cash flow generating businesses that generate a high stream of free cash flow and do not depend upon the interest rates dictated by central banks for their growth and survival. We hold 15% of our portfolio in cash to take advantage of opportunities provided to us by the market. 

We have allocated 25% of our capital to **Brookfield Corporation** and **Brookfield Asset Management** since there is value to be found in both businesses due to their recent spinoff of the asset manager. We hold 16% of our portfolio in two oil and gas producers (**Ovintiv** and **Diamondback Energy**) as the low allocation of capital in the industry and the shareholder friendly attitude of management provides opportunities for the coming period. We have furthermore some exposures to retail businesses that may be impacted by a dooming recession but a) these businesses together make up only 15% of the portfolio and b) these businesses are priced so cheaply that they are priced for a suggested bankruptcy instead of a potential recession.

**Brookfield Corporation (14.86%)**

Brookfield is a Canadian alternative asset manager that currently has over $750 billion assets under management across real estate, infrastructure, renewable power and transition, private equity, and credit. Brookfield furthermore holds equity investments in both their own investment funds and subsidiary businesses of $35 billion as well as a sizeable amount of $125 billion cash that can be deployed in their funds and the markets. They have grown their funds from operations annually by 15%. The recent downturn in the market means that they both must adjust the fair value of their investments to market prices and have more cheaper opportunities to deploy their vast amount of capital. More recently, they have distributed 25% of their asset management businesses towards shareholders in a recent spinoff. The Corporation, post spinoff, will own circa $150 billion of private and listed investments, including a 75% interest in the newly listed Manager. 

Brookfield is known for building high growing businesses from scratch and eventually deploying them on the equity markets. They have done so successfully with their asset manager. Currently they are already building their next high profitable and strongly growing business: Brookfield Insurance Solutions which contributed with increased earnings to the distributable earnings that have grown by 39%. By holding our shares in the corporation, we own a claim on the profits received from all businesses owned by the corporation and we participate in the growth of all underlying businesses as well (such as the insurance solutions).

**Brookfield Asset Management (10.72%)**

Brookfield Asset Management has recently spinoff from Brookfield Corporation and is therefore a rather new company.  The manager earnings are based on the fees they receive on their invested capital as well as their portion fees of the investment profits (carried interest). The manager has grown their fee bearing capital from $141 billion in 2018 towards $407 billion in 2022 and AUM has grown by 19% YoY, or $66 billion. Their fee-related earnings have therefore also grown from $823 million in 2018 towards $2 billion in 2022 and have grown 21% YoY, or $352 million. 83% of their fee-bearing capital is long-dated or perpetual. Currently the manager is expected to pay a quarterly (annual) dividend of $0.32 ($1.28) which amounts to a dividend yield of 4.5%. Management furthermore expects their earnings to double in 2027 and to pay 90% of their earnings as a dividend. This means that in 5 years‚Äô time at the current market price the dividend yield would be 9% as well as their earnings to double. Furthermore, the asset manager is able to buy investments at cheap prices and can demand bargain deals for private equity deals. Please notice that the corporation holds 75% of the shares of the manager and therefore receives a $1.37 billion dividend in 2022 alone, or 2.66% of their market cap of $51 billion (the corporation). We own the asset manager because we want to profit from our stake in a highly growing business that has successfully shown in the past that they are able to even outperform their own estimations.

**Ovintiv (9.40%)**

Ovintiv Inc. is a Canadian energy company that is engaged in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. The company is focused on unconventional oil and natural gas resources, including shale, tight oil, and tight gas. Ovintiv is one of the largest oil and natural gas producers in Canada and is also active in the Permian Basin in the United States. The company certainly looks undervalued with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 3.19, a free cash flow yield of 14.5% and return on equity of 71.25%. The company has focused on paying down debt and returning capital to shareholders. They have decreased their net debt from $4.6 billion to $3.6 billion in 2022 and have the approval to buyback 25 million shares (or 10% of their shares outstanding). Investors might stay away from oil companies because of the fear of a recession and the accompanying drop in oil prices, but even when oil prices drop to crude at $65, the company guides to free cash flow generation of $11B over the next 5 years. In other words, there‚Äôs a good shot the company will return nearly its entire market cap to shareholders over the next 5 years.

**Qurate Retail Group (8.08%)**

Qurate Retail Group is a multinational company that owns and operates several retail brands, including QVC, HSN, Zulily, and Ballard Designs. The company is known for its focus on home shopping and e-commerce and Qurate Retail Group's brands offer a wide range of products, including apparel, home goods, beauty products, and electronics. YTD the stock dropped 78.89% towards a market cap of $652 million with a 10-year average of $1 billion free cash flow. Several negative issues such as a fire in a distribution facility, decreasing revenue, a high annual loss and recession fears have pushed the expectation of future profitability towards new low levels. The company, however, is paying down debt at an increasing rate and could buyback their debt on a discount due to rising interest rates. Furthermore, if the company can even come close to their average of $1 billion free cash flow, they can buyback their stock and retire nearly their entire market cap in one year. Since the stock has decreased significantly, it now offers a high margin of safety and a high upside opportunity. The company is currently valued at bankruptcy levels. If the company is able to only use a $100 million of free cash flow to buy back their own stock, they can retire 15% of their outstanding shares. Qurate Retail could be one of those rare turnaround opportunities that provide limited further downside risk and substantial potential upside returns.

**Geo Group (7.09%)**

The GEO Group, Inc. is an American multinational corporation that provides government-outsourced services, primarily in the field of corrections, detention, and mental health treatment. The company was founded in 1984 and is headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida. The GEO Group operates detention centers, prisons, and mental health facilities in the United States, Australia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. The company contracts with various government agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and state and local governments. Due to the government contracts that have a retention rate of 91%, the revenues and cash flows are highly constant and predictable. The company is furthermore paying of their debt and has a highly growing electronic monitoring business unit that has grown by 74% in the past year. The Geo Group is a real estate owner that records all their PPE at ‚Äòat cost basis‚Äô and therefore highly understates their balance sheet assets which consists for 50% of buildings. The company is growing their revenue and margins and has access to 82.000 correction beds across 102 facilities; The beds are currently valued as if the facilities are idle but the beds have an occupation rate of 85%. The Geo Group seems the perfect value play for the coming year since there is little downside risk of serious losses and there are several positive catalysts coming together.

**Diamondback Energy (6.62%)**

Diamondback Energy, Inc. is a publicly traded American oil and natural gas exploration and production company. It is headquartered in Midland, Texas and is focused on the acquisition, development, and exploration of unconventional oil and natural gas resources in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The company was founded in 2007 and went public in 2012. Diamondback Energy is one of the largest independent oil and natural gas producers in the Permian Basin and is known for its focus on using advanced technology and data analytics to optimize its operations. With a dividend yield of 6.56%, an EV/EBITDA ratio of 4.19 and a free cash flow yield of 13% the company seems highly undervalued. The general investment thesis surrounding oil companies is comparable to that of Ovintiv but Diamondback Energy carries less debt than Ovintiv, adds geographic diversification of revenues and is focused on improving free cash flows by performing strategic acquisitions. The acquisitions can be highly rewardable due to the low values of the industry assets and businesses. As long as oil prices remain elevated, so also the share price of Diamondback Energy.

**Activision Blizzard (5.86%)**

Microsoft has offered to buy Activision Blizzard for $95 per share in a transaction that is expected to complete in June 2023. With the current share price of $76 this amounts to a potential 25% return in 6 months. Although we believe that the deal will go through there is always uncertainty with arbitrage opportunities and we therefore have allocated only 5% of our portfolio towards this arbitrage play. We furthermore believe the downside risk to be minimal which contributes to the investment thesis.

**Warner Bros. Discovery (5.11%)**

Warner Bros. is down from a share price of $31 towards a current share price of $9.40, or a 70% decrease in price YTD. The company is struggling with the recent merger between Warner Bros. and Discovery and incurs high merger costs as well as depreciation and amortization that have been a downward pressure on its profitability. Investors are worried about the seemingly high amount of $47 billion debt. The company, however, has shown strong cash flows and is able to pay off their debt on a discount due to recent rising interest rates. For example, in the past two quarters the company paid off $6 billion of their debt with their cash flows. The CEO has great experience in the media industry and with turning around a media company. Although there are several problems within Warner Bros. Discovery, we believe the pessimism to be overstated and we expect a turnaround when the company can control their merger costs and regain profitability.

**F&amp;G Annuities &amp; Life (4.79%)**

F&amp;G is a nationwide market leader for insurance solutions to retail annuity and life customers and institutional clients. The company has recently spinoff from parent company Fidelity National Financial and currently has a market cap of $380 million and a 4% dividend yield. They have grown their assets under management by 21% YoY towards $42 billion (which were $28.6 billion in 2020). The U.S. retirement and middle markets are growing, and F&amp;G is well-positioned for continued growth in their retail and institutional channels. F&amp;G has diverse product lines and have grown revenue with significant above industry growth numbers (sales grown 15% YoY). Recently, F&amp;G reached an inflection point where they expect to start distributing a portion of their adjusted net earnings to shareholders over time, subject to F&amp;G board of directors‚Äô approval. YTD Q3 their net income was $581 million and their adjusted net earnings were $207 million. For the past 9 quarters, they managed to earn $100 million adjusted net earnings. Given the fact that F&amp;G has grown by double digits in the past years and recently diversified into new revenue streams and has a market cap of only $380 million we highly think that the stock is undervalued.

**Stellantis NV (4.23%)**

Stellantis is the parent company of various auto brands such as Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citro√´n, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia and Maserati. As the stock is not listed in the USA, the company only reports semiannually. The stock has dropped 35% from their high in 2022 due to recession fears and the broader market decline. Although the recession fear may be correct, it seems that Stellantis is punished before it has even committed a crime. With $50 billion in cash holdings and a market cap of $45 billion, the stock holds more cash per share than the current market price. The company has furthermore fully accelerated their EV strategy and has a broad diversified group of global customers. In the short term their earnings may of course deteriorate due to a recession but with an EV/EBITDA of 0.97 and cash flow yield of 48% it looks like the company is currently priced for a potential bankruptcy instead of a recession.

**Hewlett Packard (3.66%)**

Hewlett Packard (HP) is a technology company that offers a range of products and services, including personal computers, printers, software, and hardware. The company was founded in 1939 and has become a global leader in the technology industry. In recent years, the company has faced challenges as the technology industry has evolved and has undergone several major restructuring efforts to adapt to changing market conditions. HP has a strong free cash flow yield of 14% and has returned significant capital to shareholders. The company has returned $4 billion towards shareholders by share buybacks in 2022 and have thereby elevating earnings per share by 33% since 2018. The company furthermore carries a 3.88% dividend yield and has a highly shareholder friendly management that can run the business. HP has furthermore invested into more diverse revenue streams such as their recent acquisition of Poly. Approximately 75% of office workers are investing to improve their home setups. Traditional office spaces are also being reconfigured to support hybrid work and collaboration, with a focus on meeting room solutions. Currently, there are more than 90 million rooms, of which less than 10% have video capability. As a result, the office meeting room solutions segment is expected to triple by 2024 and HP is certain to profit from this transition.

**Paramount Global (2.41%)**

Paramount Global shares have dropped by 45.76% YTD. The company‚Äôs depressed value is due to a highly negative light on the global media outlook and DTC (direct to consumer) businesses. At a PE ratio of 3.85 and a dividend yield of 5.72%, we have time to wait out the storm surrounding media companies. The company is now priced to cheap to ignore any longer. Their streaming service Paramount+,  global revenue grew 95% YoY and they have added 4.6 million subscribers in the past quarter alone. They will launch Paramount+ in France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland in Q4 adding further to their subscriber amount and Paramount+ growing revenue. Total DTC revenue grew 38% YoY. In their theatrical unit: Top Gun: Maverick became the #1 best-selling digital sell-through title in the U.S. in its first week of release. The company continued to execute their differentiated strategy with strong IP assets (some of the studio's most famous iconic films include Titanic, Forrest Gump, The Godfather, Indiana Jones, and Mission: Impossible) which they can all use for generating additional revenue. The company furthermore continues to pay down debt aggressively. In businesses, it can take some time before the growth strategy eventually shows up in the company‚Äôs financials, reaching consumers and building various new revenue streams but this brings opportunities towards early observant investors.

Even with that spike, I will sum up today as a 'pause day' -- both in terms of the majors digesting yesterday's bounce + trading at 50% average volume due to holidays.  Since the action occurred inside yesterday's candles, no sense in posting new charts -- and -- all the same levels from yesterday still apply.

**SPY**: 10x days into this bear flag &amp; trading occurred entirely within yesterday's green candle.  If price continues higher , nearest resistance is 387.41 top of the flag, followed closely by what could be major resistance at 389.63 gap fill which is also where the 20, 50, and 100 DMAs are converging. A secondary major resistance level is at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel. If price turns back around, nearest support remains the bottom of the flag at 374.77 -- with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low. 

&amp;#x200B;

**QQQ:** If you use December 13th to 28th as the pole, then today's candle could make for the 2nd day of what could beome a bear flag pattern.  Price traded almost entirely inside yesterday's candle. If price continues higher, nearest resistance is 270.70 the ascending TL which officially became a resistance level after yesterday's close. If price can get through that level, there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st. Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL. If price turns back around, nearest support remains 259.08 the previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th. 

&amp;#x200B;

**IWM:** 10x days into this bear flag &amp; trading occurred entirely within yesterday's green candle. If price continutes higher, nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's high. Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL. If price turns right back around, 170.67 the flag's bottom is back to being a support level, followed by 169.11 the pre-COVID high. Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows.

&amp;#x200B;

I executed 1x trade today:

**Trade**: ENTER  
**Type**: LONG  
**Stock**: DIS  
**Price**: 85.92  
**Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**: Price is down almost 60% from its March 2021 ATHs, 45% from the start of 2022, and now coming into an area with a lot of technical support: COVID candle lows between 85.84 and 81.09 -- as well as a descending TL from June 2022.  I missed my desired entry 2x days ago because it did not hit $84 even (it hit 84.07...of course).  When I saw yesterday's pop, I thought the bounce was in; today's retrace gave me a chance to enter at a level which is admittedly bordering on 'chasing' (hence the 0.5% position size).  I will bring this to a 1.5% position if price hits 79.07 the COVID-low double bottom.  My first target is $95 which is based on a descending TL (not charted below, sorry) connecting its pivot highs from November 2021 to 2022.

Volume profile is an indicator that shows you volume by price instead of volume by time. Volume by price is more significant because it shows you which price the most people are buying and selling the stock

How do you read it?  
The price of a stock tends to gravitate towards areas of value, which are found by searching for High Value Nodes (HVNs).   Additionally, Low Value Nodes (LVNs) are a sign that if the stock breaks into them, it will move quickly to the next HVN.  

The volume profile is excellent for determining supply and demand zones. Since we know which price levels have the most volume, we can assume that this is where most traders' cost basis is.¬†

However, we do not know whether there are more people short or long at that price level.

#[Stock futures edge lower as Wall Street awaits final trading day of 2022](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures edged lower in premarket trading Friday as investors braced for the final trading day of the worst year for stocks since 2008.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 130 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures traded lower by 0.6% and nearly 0.9%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The overnight moves followed a rally Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 climbing about 2.6% and roughly 1.8%, respectively. The Dow jumped 345 points, or 1.05%.
*****
&gt; For the week, the Dow and S&amp;P are slightly higher, with the Nasdaq on track for a modest loss. All major averages are lower for December and are poised to snap a two-month win streak.
*****
&gt; Friday marks the final day of trading of what‚Äôs been a painful year for stocks. A volatile bear market, sticky inflation, and aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve battered growth and technology stocks. These factors also weighed on investor sentiment.
*****
&gt; All three of the major averages are marching toward their worst year since 2008, slated to snap a three-year win streak. The Dow fared the best of the indexes in 2022, down 8.58%, while the S&amp;P and tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 19.24% and 33.03%, respectively.
*****
&gt; As the calendar year turns the corner, some investors think the pain is far from over, and expect the bear market to persist until a recession hits or the Fed pivots. Some also project stocks will hit new lows.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sort of stuck in neutral right now, because there are more unanswered questions than there are known entities. ... We‚Äôve got a lot riding on this coming earnings season, when we think about the pressures that are going to exist on margins,‚Äù Rebecca Felton, senior market strategist at Riverfront Investment Group, said on ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThere are a lot of questions as we head into the new year, but we certainly will be happy to see 2022 go over,‚Äù Felton added.
*****
&gt; Despite the yearly losses, the Dow is on pace for a 15.65% quarterly gain and is primed to snap a three-quarter losing streak. It‚Äôs also headed for its best quarter since the second quarter of 2020. The S&amp;P is up 7.35% and slated to break three consecutive quarterly losses. The Nasdaq‚Äôs slipped 0.92%, for its fourth consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2001.
*****
&gt; All major S&amp;P sectors finished Thursday with gains, led to the upside by communication services. For the quarter, consumer discretionary and communication services are the only sectors headed for losses. Energy is the only sector on pace for yearly gains after surging nearly 58%.
*****
&gt; Communication services stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are down more than 40% on the year and consumer discretionary has fallen 37.4%, while energy, the large-cap index‚Äôs only positive sector, has soared nearly 58%.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, Chicago PMI data for December is due out Friday. Next week will see a slightly more active slate for economic data, highlighted by the nonfarm payrolls report set for Jan. 6. Financial markets are closed Monday in observance of the New Year‚Äôs Day holiday.

435,StockMarket,"Mullen has had so much incredible news recently, they've hired ex-Tesla staff and have built an infrastructure across the USA to kick start major production of EV's that the average American working family can afford. They've also introduced an affordable micro EV this week - a perfect $15,000 product with warranty and charger for busy mega cities of Europe and are also aiming for US Military contracts with Bollinger Motors - As you can tell, I really like this stock.

**YESTERDAY** **was the biggest news I've seen so far**, the cost to borrow shares to short sell went up from 9% to a whopping 313% (source below). Instantly we saw the stock spiked +20% because of this. But the short-share float of MULN is a giant 49% and this has to be bought back now because funds cannot afford to hold it!!! anything over 20% interest generally won't be held by funds (LET ALONE 313%)

The stock price of Mullen has been manipulated and driven down for so long by short sellers and Hindenburg research, C'mon the stock is 49% shorted... this is what Hedge funds used to collectively do to try and bankrupt companies - just like Toys'r'us.

It would be incredible to see how this plays out and I really believe the 49% short position HAS to be covered and bought back over the next few weeks unless the cost to borrow returns below 20%. I really believe this stock should already be $3+ already. I've bought massive positions around and I'm not selling until at least $3, anything under $0.50 is a bargain in me eyes. I hope everyone can see how incredible this opportunity is and I personally would also love to see a new American founded technology company with dreams as big as Mullen beat the Hedge funds that are trying to bankrupt them and have the short squeeze of a lifetime that I truly believe is coming. take care all, I really wish everyone could succeed from and get the reward we deserve.

**SPY**: 9x days into this bear flag, as today's reversal remained well within the flag.  If price continues higher tomorrow, nearest resistance is 387.41 top of the flag, followed closely by what could be major resistance at 389.63 gap fill which is also where the 20, 50, and 100 DMAs are converging.  A secondary major resistance level is at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel.  If price turns back around, nearest support remains the bottom of the flag at 374.77 -- with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd (the same level where QQQ bounce, of note). Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to October 13th pivot low.

**QQQ:** Perfect technical bounce off the 260 supprt level from the Nov 4th pivot low.  If price continues higher tomorrow, nearest resistance is 270.70 the ascending TL which officially became a resistance level after yesterday's close. If price can get through that level, there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st. Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.  If price turns back around, nearest support remains 259.08 the previous pivot low, followed by major support at 254.26 double bottom from October 13th.

**IWM:** 9x days into this bear flag, but of note, a daily close back inside the flag...which negates the potential 'breakdown' from yesterday's close below &amp; restarts the 'look out.' If price continutes higher, nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's high. Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL.  If price turns right back around, 170.67 the flag's bottom is back to being a support level, followed by 169.11 the pre-COVID high.  Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows.

I sold the entire position for a loss at a price of $5.20

Well, the price started tanking and I was like ""oh man this is so easy,"" and then right after I did it I had a thought. ""how does this affect my taxes?"" Then I realized the rule. I basically tax loss harvested.

Now, I know what went down. I kept increasing my position. I was buying in the $4 range and my purchase price was still around $6+ to account for the wash sale value. I've just been averaging down and now I'm sitting at a basis of $6.20. Technically if I wanted to hold the stock long-term, then I wouldn't mind. However, some new information came out that makes me want to deleverage my position. 

So now, my question is. If I sold, let's say half or even my entire position at this new loss (albeit a lesser one), will I receive a tax loss write-off on my taxes? I need this answered asap because the last day to sell is tomorrow. If the answer is no, I'll ride this into the new year.

478,StockMarket,"2022 has been tough for me as a rookie individual investor: so many uncertainties, fluctuations, and major policy shifts. I tried to adjust my portfolio to catch up, but by the end of the year it is still down about 8%. Nevertheless, I‚Äôve been able to earn significant dividends amid portfolio adjustment to make up for those losses (about 50%=-60% offset) and learned some valuable lessons. I would like to humbly offer my thoughts on investment trends and sectors to watch out for in 2023. 

======

Macro/Policy Trends

\-Fed must slow down rate hikes to rejuvenate the economy, but they will still have to tame inflation both for economic and for political reasons (I don‚Äôt believe in Fed neutrality anyway). Projection: the rate would top in summer-autumn 2023 and it would stay there for a while till Fed officials figure out what to do. A rate slash may not come until winter of 2023 or even early 2024 (coincidentally or not, to pave the political way for the next presidential election). 

\-Russo-Ukraine war has exhausted both the Western powers and Russia, although it may have exhausted Russia more severely. The battlefront has largely been a stalemate since November, and there may not be any profound situational change until early Spring of 2023, when the weather and the terrain become suitable for large-scale actions again. Talks of peaceful resolution are circulating out there, but my projection is that neither side wants to settle quickly until the Spring 2023 actions produce a clearer view of situations. Hence, the geopolitical uncertainties of this war would linger for quite a while.  

\-China‚Äôs U-turn of COVID lockdown policy, having been brewing for a while, still comes as a major surprise at the year‚Äôs end. However, although I do not condone the China-Imminent-Collapse view, I do not expect China to regain momentum soon. All the talks about supply chain relocation and investor cautions aside, the three-year lockdown (and especially the more draconian 18-month lockdown since mid-2021) has severely depleted China‚Äôs foreign reserve, rattled its consumption power and confidence, disrupted its labor force, and exposed its crippling weakness in social welfare provision. Even if China could power through the current wave of infection, it would still need some time to reset, restart, and contemplate what type of economic relations it wants with Western powers. What‚Äôs more, Xi Jinping has literally botched every grand strategic initiative since his second term starting in 2017-18: Belt and Road, hostility towards Western powers, indigenous high-tech development, ambition to bridge the domestic wealth gap, crackdown on tech and real estate sectors, Xinjiang/Uyghurs region, Hong Kong‚Ä¶. you name it. Now, the only major opportunity for him to garner some additional legitimacy for a fourth term and maintain the current surveillance state structure would be a war to invade/‚Äù reunite‚Äù Taiwan. With the COVID lockdown gone, his anxiety might cause him to take increasingly hostile moves against Taiwan, maybe even launch a preemptive (and hasty) strike soon. All in all, I do not expect much good news out of China and would refrain from investing heavily in its reopening/rejuvenation of the economy at least until winter of 2023. 

\-Continuing the geopolitical trend, and finally as a wrap up, the major difficulty for me is to identify a geographical region exhibiting clear momentum of growth in 2023 that could inject new rigor into the world economy. Even amid the pandemic, China‚Äôs lockdown-and-keep-producing strategy allowed it to maintain decent economic growth in 2020; when China began to lose its steam in 2021, USA, Japan, and some major economic powers of South America as well as Europe began to walk out of pandemic lockdown and took over the banner for growth. But for 2023 it seems every major region in the world is grappling with their own economic difficulties and no one is ready to take the helm. Besides, the increasingly inward-looking mentality and security-based concerns might cause a new round of severance/reformulation of global economic connections. My view may be overly grim, but for me 2023 would continue to be a muddy, rough, and restructuring year. 

====== 

Sectors/Investment Options (Both Positive and Negative Views)

\-Energy/Clean Energy: With the Russo-Ukraine war still having no end in sight, global energy security continues to be an issue. Major powers will continue to spend strenuous efforts to secure only oil and gas resources, but also the pipeline carrying them. Talks about clean and alternative energy continue to thrive, but it appears the major concern is safeguarding more traditional options. I would probably maintain a 60-40 mix of traditional/fossil energy and clean/alternative energy. 

\-Healthcare/Pharmaceutical: Another major sector I will be keeping an eye on. With COVID still raging in some parts of the world, vaccination/dedicated medicines still pose some opportunities. One interesting thing I would love to track is whether China would finally give up its ‚Äúnot losing face‚Äù stance and start importing foreign COVID vaccines (they rejected foreign mRNA vaccines but have begun importing medications in small amount). Even with COVID pandemic in rear mirror, global population continues to get older, and needs for combating new viruses/difficult diseases continue to exist. This is a long-term sector I will keep investing in. 

\-Real Estate/Housing: With Fed rate hikes, house buying seem to have seceded from the 2021 frenzy. I plan to shift my focus on housing and housing-related real estates to alternative options such as warehouse and storage, tech data centers, and telecommunication infrastructures. With global travel recovering steadily, I may also look at some opportunities in hospitality real estate. 

\-Tech: the majority of my loss this year comes from trying to identify ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù stocks and catch up with market trends, only to be taught by the market to stop doing something I am just not good at. So, tuitions paid, and lessons learned. I plan to stay way for the first quarter of 2023 and only start investing in tech companies exhibiting good fundamentals later. 

\-Food and Beverage: Like energy, food supplies are also strained due to geopolitical concerns, but contrary to energy, a raw material shortage is no great news for food and beverage businesses. With this amount of ambiguity, I would be extra careful in this sector trying to identify what companies could best weather through the supply shortage. 

\-Precious Metal: Since 2018 I‚Äôve been buying both physical gold and silver and ETFs of gold and silver. They may not be the best performing hedge or alternative investment options in 2022, but they are still some of the most easily accessible for individual investors like myself, and their price hike in the past few years also make up with some of my losses this year. I will keep regularly investing a dedicated amount of cash into precious metal. 

\-Bonds/Debts: I have to say I am not knowledgeable in this sector. I do hold mixed bond ETFs (performing roughly the same as my entire portfolio), and I‚Äôve heard recommendations on investment-grade bonds and municipal bonds (munies), but I did not do much homework on them. Any suggestions are welcome. 

\-High-yield Savings Account: I put whatever emergency and surplus cash in several high-yield savings accounts, and they have been able to generate enough interests to cover at least my grocery spending every week. It‚Äôs always good to earn a few extra bucks on idle cash. Since I do not see a rate slash soon, I will keep saving into these accounts.

482,StockMarket,"It was a brutal year for mega-cap tech stocks across the board. But 2022 was especially rough for Amazon.

Shares of the e-retailer are wrapping up their worst year since the dot-com crash. The stock has tumbled 51% in 2022, marking the biggest decline since 2000, when it plunged 80%. Only Tesla, down 68%, and Meta, off 66%, have had a worse year among the most valuable tech companies.

Amazon‚Äôs market cap has shrunk to about $834 billion from $1.7 trillion to start the year. The company fell out of the trillion-dollar club last month.

Much of Amazon‚Äôs misfortunes are tied to the economy and macro environment. Soaring inflation and rising interest rates have pushed investors away from growth and into companies with high profit margins, consistent cash flow and high dividend yields.

But Amazon investors have had other reasons to exit the stock. The company is contending with slowing sales, as predictions of a sustained post-Covid e-commerce boom didn‚Äôt pan out. At the height of the pandemic, consumers came to depend on online retailers like Amazon for goods ranging from toilet paper and face masks to patio furniture. That drove Amazon‚Äôs stock to record highs as sales soared.

As the economy reopened, consumers gradually returned to shopping in stores and spending on things like travel and restaurants, which caused Amazon‚Äôs impressive revenue growth to fade. The situation only worsened at the start of this year, as the company confronted higher costs tied to inflation, the war in Ukraine and supply chain constraints.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded founder Jeff Bezos at the helm in July 2021, admitted that the company hired too many workers and overbuilt its warehouse network as it raced to keep up with pandemic-era demand. It‚Äôs since paused or abandoned plans to open some new facilities, and its head count shrank in the second quarter.

483,StockMarket,"***Pozsar's Notes Are Always Insightful and Challenging Reads - TLDR up front, and even that is lengthy:***

* A multipolar world order is being created by the heads of state of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa)
* The actions of China's President Xi and Russia's President Putin will have significant impact on the future of the US dollar and liquidity in the US Treasury market
* Bretton Woods III is being formed and China is increasingly encumbering OPEC+'s oil and gas reserves
* During a recent China-GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) Summit, President Xi announced plans to work with GCC countries to establish a new paradigm of all-dimensional energy cooperation, including purchasing large quantities of crude oil and LNG from GCC countries, strengthening cooperation in the upstream sector, and utilizing the Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange platform for RMB settlement in oil and gas trade
* This cooperation will likely result in more commodity encumbrance and higher inflation rates in the West
* Inflation traders should be paranoid and aware that the market has not yet realized that cross-currency bases will be smaller and commodity bases will be greater in the emerging multipolar world order.
* China plans to purchase large quantities of oil and natural gas from GCC countries in the next 3-5 years, and to pay for these purchases in renminbi.
* China is also interested in working with GCC countries on a range of priority areas, including clean energy infrastructure, 5G and 6G projects, and smart manufacturing.
* The People's Bank of China (PBoC) has recently re-started gold purchases, and the renminbi is now convertible to gold on the Shanghai and Hong Kong Gold Exchanges.
* The PBoC, in partnership with the Bank of Thailand, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, is working on the m-CBDC Bridge project, which enables real-time, cross-border transactions using central bank digital currencies without involving the US dollar or Western correspondent banks.
* President Xi mentioned the possibility of currency swap cooperation, whereby China could lend renminbi to GCC countries in exchange for their local currency, to be used to buy goods and services.
* Russia, Iran, and Venezuela have effectively pledged their resources to the BRICS and Belt-and-Road initiatives.
* China is also seeking to court the GCC countries to join these initiatives under a ""new paradigm.""
* The ""new paradigm"" includes the creation of an international reserve currency based on a basket of currencies of BRICS and Belt-and-Road countries, known as the ""BRICS coin.""
* This ""BRICS coin"" project is being led by Sergei Glazyev, who is minister in charge of integration and macroeconomics for the Eurasian Economic Commission.
* The weight of each participating currency in the ""BRICS coin"" will be determined by the amount of natural resources a country reserves for the backing of the new economic system.
* Bilateral swap lines with trading partner countries will provide financing for co-investments and trade financing.
* The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has granted dialogue partner status to Saudi Arabia and Qatar and has started procedures to admit Iran as a member.
* Improved relations among Russia, Iran, China, and Saudi Arabia could lead to increased momentum for the Belt and Road Initiative, BRICS+, and ""BRICS coin.""
* The Belt and Road Initiative and BRICS+ will likely require the Middle East to be a ""garden of civilizations,"" with improved relations and cooperation among the participating countries.

# War and Commodity Encumbrance

War encumbers commodities.

A recurring theme in my dispatches this year has been that in a moment when the world is going from unipolar to multipolar, the actions of heads of state are far more important than the actions of central banks. That is because heads of state lead, their actions affect inflation, and central banks merely follow by hiking rates to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù. Central banks will be behind the curve in this game, and if investors read only the speeches of central bankers but not statesmen, they will be even more behind the curve. The multipolar world order is being built not by G7 heads of state but by the ‚ÄúG7 of the East‚Äù (the BRICS heads of state), which is a G5 really but because of ‚ÄúBRICSpansion‚Äù, I took the liberty to round up.

The special relationship between China and Russia has a financial agenda to it, and what President Xi and President Putin say about the future of money ‚Äì that is, the future they envision ‚Äì matters for the future of the U.S. dollar and liquidity in the U.S. Treasury market. Their actions are forging something new: Bretton Woods III is slowly taking shape, and in light of developments to date, my motto for Bretton Woods III ‚Äì ‚Äúour commodity, your problem‚Äù ‚Äì remains apt.

President Xi‚Äôs visit with Saudi and GCC leaders marks the birth of the petroyuan and a leap in China‚Äôs growing encumbrance of OPEC+‚Äôs oil and gas reserves: with the China-GCC Summit, China can claim to have built a ‚Äúspecial relationship‚Äù not only with the ‚Äú+‚Äù sign in OPEC+ (Russia), but with Iran and all of OPEC+‚Ä¶

President Xi‚Äôs visit was the very first China-Arab States Summit in history, and echoes FDR‚Äôs meeting with King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud on Valentine‚Äôs Day 1945 aboard an American cruiser, the USS Quincy. Fixed income investors should care ‚Äì not just because the invoicing of oil in renminbi will hurt the dollar‚Äôs might, but also because commodity encumbrance means more inflation for the West.

Here are the key parts from President Xi‚Äôs speech at the China-GCC Summit (all emphasis with orange underlines are mine): ‚ÄúIn the next three to five years, China is ready to work with GCC countries in the following priority areas: first, setting up a new paradigm of all-dimensional energy cooperation, where China will continue to import large quantities of crude oil on a long-term basis from GCC countries, and purchase more LNG. We will strengthen our cooperation in the upstream sector, engineering services, as well as \[downstream\] storage, transportation, and refinery. The Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange platform will be fully utilized for RMB settlement in oil and gas trade, \[‚Ä¶\] and we could start currency swap cooperation and advance the m-CBDC Bridge project‚Äù.

Let‚Äôs dissect President Xi‚Äôs comments bit by bit, and color them with other pieces of information as we go along. First, what is the ‚Äúduration‚Äù of this theme?

It‚Äôs pretty short: in the words of President Xi, ‚Äúthe next three to five years‚Äù. In market terms, that means that five-year forward five-year inflation break-evens should be discounting a world in which oil and gas is invoiced not only in dollars but also renminbi, and in which some oil and gas is not available for the West at low prices (and in dollars) because they have been encumbered by the East.

But it does not appear that breakeven expectations reflect anything like that‚Ä¶

My sense is that the market is starting to realize that the world is going from unipolar to multipolar politically, but the market has yet to make the leap that in the emerging multipolar world order, cross-currency bases will be smaller, commodity bases will be greater, and inflation rates in the West will be higher‚Ä¶

Inflation traders should be paranoid, not complacent. As Andy Grove said, ‚Äúonly the paranoid survive‚Äù, but when I asked a small group of inflation traders over dinner in London this summer about how the market (they) comes up with five-year forward five-year breakevens, I did not sense any degree of paranoia in their answer: ‚Äúthere is no top-down or bottom-up work that we do to come up with our estimates; we take central banks‚Äô inflation targets as a given and the rest is liquidity‚Äù. Inflation breakevens do not seem to price any geopolitical risk.

Second, ‚Äúparadigm‚Äù in ‚Äúa new paradigm of all-dimensional energy cooperation‚Äù is a symbolic word. The meeting between FDR and King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud was a new paradigm too: the U.S.‚Äôs security guarantees for the kingdom for access to affordable oil supplies. Over time, the paradigm boiled down to this:

the U.S. imported oil and paid for it with U.S. dollars, which Saudi Arabia spent on Treasuries and arms and recycled the leftovers as deposits in U.S. banks. (In the wake of the OPEC shocks of the 1970s, that recycling of petrodollars led to the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s.) The old paradigm worked‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶until it didn‚Äôt:

the U.S. is now less reliant on oil from the Middle East owing to the shale revolution, while China is the largest importer of oil; security relations are in flux (see here); Saudi holdings of U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits are down as the kingdom went from funding the U.S. government and banks to owning equity in firms; and the Saudi crown prince said recently that the kingdom could reduce its investments in the U.S. (see here). Similar patterns hold in other GCC countries.

&amp;#x200B;

The ‚Äúnew paradigm‚Äù between China, Saudi Arabia, and GCC countries is fundamentally different from the one struck aboard USS Quincy. Naturally so, as China is now dealing with a rich Middle East, whereas FDR was dealing with a Middle East that had just started to develop. With wealth, power and priorities shift:

back then, ‚Äúliquidity and security‚Äù were more important for an emerging region; today, ‚Äúequity and respect‚Äù are more important for what has become an eminent region.

That is what China offered: ‚Äúall-dimensional energy cooperation‚Äù means not just taking oil for cash and arms but investing in the region in the ‚Äúdownstream sector‚Äù and leveraging the regional know-how for cooperation in the ‚Äúupstream sector‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äúupstream‚Äù could potentially mean the joint exploration of oil in the South China Sea.

Furthermore, Xi‚Äôs ‚Äúall-dimensional energy cooperation‚Äù also means working in cooperation on the ‚Äúlocalized production of new energy equipment‚Äù (see here).

Put differently, ‚Äúoil for development‚Äù (plants and jobs) crowded out ‚Äúoil for arms‚Äù ‚Äì the Belt and Road Initiative met Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Vision 2030 in a big win-win‚Ä¶

Third, the ‚Äúnew paradigm‚Äù will not be funded with U.S. dollars:

President Xi noted that ‚Äúthe Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange \[‚Ä¶\] will be fully utilized for RMB settlement in oil and gas trade‚Äù. President Xi‚Äôs comments that ‚ÄúChina will continue to import large quantities of crude oil on a long-term basis from GCC countries, and purchase more LNG‚Äù underscores the gravity of the underlined quote: combined, the two basically say that China, already the largest buyer of oil and gas from GCC countries, will buy even more in the future, and wants to pay for all of it in renminbi over the next three to five years.

Again, think of the timing of this statement in a diplomatic sense: President Xi communicated his message on ‚Äúrenminbi invoicing‚Äù not during the first day of his visit ‚Äì when he met only the Saudi leadership ‚Äì but during the second day of his visit ‚Äì when he met the leadership of all the GCC countries ‚Äì to in part signal‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶GCC oil flowing East + renminbi invoicing = the dawn of the petroyuan.

Good morning!

Given the scope of priority areas in which China plans to work with GCC countries ‚Äì the sale of clean energy infrastructure, big data and cloud computing centers, 5G and 6G projects, and cooperation in smart manufacturing and space exploration as per Xi‚Äôs speech ‚Äì there will be many avenues through which GCC countries will be able to decumulate the renminbi they earn from selling oil and gas to China.

And if, perish the thought, any GCC country were to accumulate some surplus cash in ‚Äúnon-convertible‚Äù renminbi, just as President Xi‚Äôs plane was landing in Riyadh, the PBoC revealed that during 2022, it had re-started gold purchases with gusto.

Why do China‚Äôs gold purchases matter in the context of renminbi settlement?

Because at the 2018 BRICS Summit, China launched a renminbi-denominated oil futures contract on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange, and since 2016 and 2017, the renminbi has been convertible to gold on the Shanghai and Hong Kong Gold Exchanges, respectively. Not a bad deal, this renminbi‚Ä¶

Paraphrasing Forrest Gump, ‚Äúyou can spend it on solar panels, wind turbines, data centers, telecommunications equipment, or space projects to create jobs, or you can just recycle it at some bank or just convert it to good old gold bars. Money is as money does, and convertibility to gold beats convertibility to dollars‚Äù.

President Xi‚Äôs ‚Äúthree- to five-year horizon‚Äù means that by 2025, the GCC may be paid in renminbi for all of the oil and gas that they will be shipping east to China.

Fourth, ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù references in Xi‚Äôs speech add further gravity to the above‚Ä¶

When was the last time you heard a head of state talk about swap lines and central bank digital currencies (CBDC)? And not just any CBDC, but a specific one:

*‚Äúthe m-CBDC Bridge project‚Äù*

The m-CBDC Bridge project, or as the BIS likes to refer to it, Project mBridge, is a masterclass in plumbing: undertaken by the PBoC, the Bank of Thailand, the HKMA, and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, the project enables real-time, peer-to-peer, cross-border, and foreign exchange transactions using CBDCs, and does so without involving the U.S. dollar or the network of Western correspondent banks that the U.S. dollar system runs on. Pretty interesting, no?

In a very Uncle Sam-like fashion (see here), China wants more of the GCC‚Äôs oil, wants to pay for it with renminbi, and wants the GCC to accept e-renminbi on the m-CBDC Bridge platform, so don‚Äôt hesitate ‚Äì join the mBridge fast train‚Ä¶

And finally, President Xi‚Äôs reference to starting ‚Äúcurrency swap cooperation‚Äù, reminded me of using swap lines as analogues of the Lend-Lease agreement whereby the U.S. lent dollars to Britain to buy arms to fight Germany during WWII:

now we fight climate change and if you don‚Äôt earn renminbi to build NEOM, no problem at all, we can swap your local currency for my local currency whereby I lend you some renminbi and then you can buy the stuff you need, and when you will start selling me oil for renminbi, you can pay off the swap lines. All I care about is that you don‚Äôt pay for imports from me in U.S. dollars, because I have enough U.S. dollars already and I don‚Äôt want to add to my sanctions risk.

The ‚Äúm-CBDC Bridge project‚Äù offers further leads down the monetary rabbit hole: I didn‚Äôt understand ‚Äúwhy‚Äù when I first read about Russia requesting oil payments from India in United Arab Emirates dirhams, but now I do: dirhams ‚Äúappeal‚Äù to Russia because the Central Bank of the UAE is a member of m-CBDC Bridge, and so dirhams can be sold for renminbi using central bank digital currencies and thus away from the Western banking system. This does not necessarily have to go through the m-CBDC Bridge project per se, but the existence of it implies that some CBDCs are already interlinked to facilitate interstate payments ‚Äúoff the Western system‚Äù. Then, perhaps inspired by Russia‚Äôs payment request, on December 6th, Bloomberg ran a story about India and the UAE working on a rupee-dirham payment mechanism to bypass the U.S. dollar in bilateral trade, a mechanism that will include payments for oil and gas purchases from the UAE.

Do take a step back and consider‚Ä¶ that since the beginning of this year, 2022, Russia has been selling oil to China for renminbi, and to India for UAE dirhams; India and the UAE are working on settling oil and gas trades in dirhams by 2023; and China is asking the GCC to ‚Äúfully‚Äù utilize Shanghai‚Äôs exchanges to settle all oil and gas sales to China in renminbi by 2025. That‚Äôs dusk for the petrodollar‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and dawn for the petroyuan. Now on to the topic of commodity encumbrance.

In money and banking, the word ‚Äúencumbrance‚Äù is typically used in the context of transactions involving collateral: if collateral is pledged to a specific trade, it‚Äôs referred to as ‚Äúencumbered‚Äù, which means it can‚Äôt be used to do other trades. If encumbrance becomes extreme, collateral gets scarce, which typically shows up as interest rates on scarce pieces of collateral trading deeply below OIS rates‚Ä¶

Under Bretton Woods III, a system in which commodities are collateral, encumbrance means that commodities can get scarce in certain parts of the world ‚Äì and that scarcity shows up as inflation ‚Äúprinting‚Äù far above inflation targets‚Ä¶

To see what encumbrance means in the context of the oil and gas markets today, let‚Äôs start with the geographic scope of OPEC+, that is, OPEC plus Russia: the original founding members of OPEC were the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Venezuela in 1960, which were later joined by Qatar (1961), Indonesia (1962), Libya (1962), the United Arab Emirates (1967), Algeria (1969), Nigeria (1971), Ecuador (1973), Gabon (1975), Angola (2007), Equatorial Guinea (2017), and Congo (2018). Russia joined OPEC in 2016 ‚Äì a union that forged OPEC+. Think of OPEC+ as follows: Russia, Iran, the GCC, Latin American producers, North African producers, West African producers, and Indonesia. I left out Iraq, where ISIS is complicating the overall picture, but the rest of the groupings show how China is starting to dominate OPEC+:

First, Russia and China have their famous special relationship, and since the outbreak of hostilities in Ukraine, China has been paying for Russian oil in renminbi at a steep discount. As President Putin remarked, ‚ÄúChina drives a hard bargain‚Äù.

Second, Iran and China have also had a special relationship since March 27, 2021 ‚Äì the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership ‚Äì a 25-year ‚Äúdeal‚Äù under which China committed to invest $400 billion into Iran‚Äôs economy in exchange for a steady supply of Iranian oil at a steep discount. The deal included $280 billion toward developing downstream petrochemical sectors (refining and plastics) and $120 billion toward Iran‚Äôs transportation and manufacturing infrastructure. Specifically, under the agreement, ‚ÄúChina will be able to buy any and all Iranian oil, gas, and petrochemical products at a minimum guaranteed discount of 12 percent to the six-month rolling mean price of comparable benchmark products, plus another 6 to 8 percent on top for risk-adjusted compensation‚Äù (see here). This means that Iran is selling its oil to China at about the same price as Russia, or maybe in reverse, as the Iran deal predates the post-Ukraine prices for Russia!

Third, Venezuela has been accepting payments for oil in renminbi since 2019 (see here) and has also been selling oil to China at steep discounts (see here).

Fourth, Xi‚Äôs GCC ‚Äúpitch‚Äù was similar to the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Iran ‚Äì investments in downstream petrochemical projects, manufacturing, and infrastructure ‚Äì plus some higher value-added projects for Saudi Arabia to aid Riyadh‚Äôs Silicon Valley aspirations. Because the GCC aren‚Äôt sanctioned, China didn‚Äôt ask for any steep discounts, but it did ask for renminbi settlement.

Let‚Äôs stop here for a moment. Russia, Iran, and Venezuela account for about 40 percent of the world‚Äôs proven oil reserves, and each of them are currently selling oil to China for renminbi at a steep discount. The GCC countries account for 40 percent of proven oil reserves as well ‚Äì Saudi Arabia has a half of that, and the other GCC countries the other half ‚Äì and are being courted by China to accept renminbi for their oil in exchange for transformative investments ‚Äì the ‚Äúnew paradigm‚Äù we discussed above. To underscore, the U.S. has sanctioned half of OPEC with 40 percent of the world‚Äôs oil reserves and lost them to China, while China is courting the other half of OPEC with an offer that‚Äôs hard to refuse‚Ä¶

The remaining 20 percent of proven oil reserves are in North and West Africa and Indonesia. Geopolitically, North Africa is dominated by Russia at present (see here), West Africa by China, and Indonesia has its own agenda (see below).

Commodity encumbrance here means that over the next ‚Äúthree to five years‚Äù, China will not only pay for more oil in renminbi (crowding out the U.S. dollar), but new investments in downstream petrochemical industries in Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the GCC more broadly mean that in the future, much more value-added will be captured locally at the expense of industries in the West. Think of this as a ‚Äúfarm-to-table‚Äù model: I used to sell my chicken and vegetables to you, and you sold soup for a markup in your five-star restaurant, but from now on, I‚Äôll make the soup myself and you‚Äôll get to import it in a can ‚Äì my oil, my jobs, your spend, ‚Äúour commodity, your problem. ‚ÄúOur commodity, our emancipation‚Äù.

Commodity encumbrance has had its first major casualty in Europe already: BASF‚Äôs decision to permanently downsize its operations at its main plant in Ludwigshafen and instead shift its chemical operations to China was motivated by the fact that China is securing energy at discounts, not markups like Europe.

Collateral encumbrance means encumbrance from the perspective of someone pledging collateral to a dealer. Dealers in turn rehypothecate pledged collateral.

Commodity rehypothecation will work the same way: heavily discounted oil and locally produced chemicals invoiced in renminbi mean encumbrance by the East, and the marginal re-export of oil and chemicals also for renminbi to the West means commodity rehypothecation for a profit, i.e., an ‚ÄúEast-to-West‚Äù spread‚Ä¶

We are starting to see examples of commodity rehypothecation already:

China became a big exporter of Russian LNG to Europe, and India a big exporter of Russian oil and refined products such as diesel to Europe.

We should expect more ""rehypothecation"" in the future across more products and invoiced not just in euros and dollars, but also renminbi, dirhams, and rupees.

But commodity encumbrance has a darker, ""institutional"" aspect to it too...

What I described above is a *de facto* state of affairs, in which Russia, Iran, and Venezuela have effectively pledged their resources to the BRICS and Belt-and-Road ""cause"", and China is courting the GCC to do the same under a ""*new paradigm*"".

But there is also a de jure version of the commodity encumbrance theme, and here is where a recent speech by President Putin comes in. On June 22, 2022, at the BRICS Business Forum ‚Äì a WEF-like meeting of the ‚ÄúG7 of the East‚Äù ‚Äì President Putin noted that ‚Äúthe creation of an international reserve currency based on a basket of currencies of our countries is being worked on‚Äù (see here).

This ‚Äúreserve currency project‚Äù took off after China failed to reform the SDR, and its antecedents were chronicled in a recent book by Zoe Liu and Mihaela Papa: Can the BRICS De-Dollarize the Global Financial System (see here). The book was funded by the Rising Power Alliances Project at the Fletcher School of Tufts University, which in turn was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense.

It would seem to me that if the DoD has a keen interest in the topic of de-dollarization, market participants should have one as well, and should also add commodity encumbrance to the list. Now back to Putin‚Äôs ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù idea‚Ä¶

When a G7 rates strategist or trader starts looking at the ‚ÄúG7 of the East‚Äù, he or she will realize that institutions and people are different, but they do exist.

Regarding the development of an ‚Äúinternational reserve currency‚Äù √† la the SDR, Sergei Glazyev has been in charge. Since 2019, Glazyev has been serving as minister in charge of integration and macroeconomics of the EEC, that is, the Eurasian Economic Commission. He strikes me as someone similar to Liu He, who President Xi introduced to a former U.S. national security advisor saying: ‚ÄúThis is Liu He. He is very important to me‚Äù. Given his recent progress report on ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù, Sergei Glazyev seems to be very important to President Putin.

Regarding ‚Äúinstitutionalized commodity encumbrance‚Äù, the comments I could find about the ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù project from Glazyev revolve around the methodology to determine the weight of each participating currency in the ‚Äúcoin‚Äù. Specifically:

‚Äúshould \[a nation\] reserve a portion of \[its\] natural resources for the backing of the new economic system, \[its\] respective weight in the currency basket of the new monetary unit would increase accordingly, providing that nation with larger currency reserves and credit capacity. In addition, bilateral swap lines with trading partner countries would provide them with adequate financing for co-investments and trade financing‚Äù (see here). Hm. Swap lines again to facilitate trade and investments, and a de jure vision for commodity encumbrance in exchange for boosting a country‚Äôs ‚Äúcredit line‚Äù in an alternative economic system.

It seems to me that ‚Äúnew paradigms‚Äù come in pairs‚Ä¶

Attention needs to be paid to the goings-on of the global East and South, especially given that this year Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran have all started their application to the BRICS (see here). Furthermore, following this year‚Äôs Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit in Samarkand, the SCO ‚Äì ‚Äúthe NATO of the East‚Äù ‚Äì granted dialogue partner status to ‚Äúhalf the GCC‚Äù ‚Äì Saudi Arabia and Qatar ‚Äì and started procedures to admit Iran as a member‚Ä¶

In Riyadh, President Xi referred to ‚Äúa garden of civilizations‚Äù in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative (see here). Unless they involve Adam, Eve, and a snake, gardens typically refer to a happy and peaceful place. Now consider that if Russia and Iran get along, China and Iran get along, Russia and Saudi Arabia get along, and China and Saudi Arabia get along, then the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia and Iran engaging in what the FT called ‚Äúfriendly talks‚Äù last week (see here) means more momentum for Belt and Road, BRICS+, and ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù.

Indeed, for the Belt and Road Initiative to work, the region has to be a peaceful ‚Äúgarden of civilizations‚Äù, and for ‚Äúthe enemy of my enemy is my friend‚Äù to work, a Great Power needs to befriend the enemy of a rival Great Power. But that strategy is increasingly hard to implement in the Middle Eastern ‚Äúregion‚Äù of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI): the great powers of the Eurasian landmass ‚Äì China and Russia ‚Äì are bound by a ‚Äúspecial relationship‚Äù, and each of them have good a relationship with each of the great powers of the Middle East, and all of them have much to gain from building a new economic and monetary system.

The China-GCC Summit is one thing, and China‚Äôs strategic partnership with Iran is another, but both Saudi Arabia and Iran applying to pillar institutions of the multipolar world order ‚Äì BRICS+ and the SCO ‚Äì at the same exact time, plus the idea of ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù as a commodity-weighted neutral reserve asset that encourages members to pledge their commodities to the BRICS ‚Äúcause‚Äù, should have G7 bond investors concerned, because these trends may keep inflation from slowing and interest rates from falling for the rest of this decade. Finally, the de facto and de jure commodity encumbrance themes described above have an even graver inflationary undertone if you consider the following:

Over the past decade, all growth in global oil production came from U.S. shale and other non-conventional sources such as Canadian tar sands. We know from official comments following President Biden‚Äôs visit to Saudi Arabia that the kingdom is currently ‚Äúpumping‚Äù at capacity and will be able to boost output by only one million barrels per day by 2025 and then ‚Äúno more‚Äù. In light of that, consider that production from shale fields has peaked and recall some recent comments from the largest shale operator in the U.S. that more drilling would harm the shale industry (see here). It appears to me that unless the U.S. nationalizes shale oil fields and starts to drill for oil itself to boost production, over the next three to five years, we‚Äôre looking at an inelastic supply of oil and gas‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and of that inelastic supply:

1. China will get a bigger share at a discount, invoiced in renminbi.
2. China will export more downstream products at a wider margin, and‚Ä¶
3. China will lure more firms like BASF with discounted energy bills.
4. Iran, with Chinese capital, will do more downstream exports too, and‚Ä¶
5. GCC countries, with Chinese capital, ditto, most likely for renminbi.

The ‚Äúnew paradigm‚Äù, as I see it, comes with a theme of ‚Äúemancipation‚Äù: both sanctioned and non-sanctioned members of OPEC, with Chinese capital, are going to adopt the ‚Äúfarm-to-table‚Äù model in which they will not just sell oil but will also refine more of it and process more of it into high value-added petrochemical products. Given supply constraints over ‚Äúthe next three to five years‚Äù, this will likely be at the expense of refiners and petrochemical firms in the West, and also growth in the West. All this means much less domestic production and more inflation as steadily price-inflating alternatives are imported from the East.

And this is not just about oil and gas‚Ä¶

Earlier this year, President Widodo of Indonesia (an OPEC member since 1962) called for an OPEC-style cartel for battery metals for EVs. Resource nationalism is in the air, but markets don‚Äôt seem to price it as a potential driver of inflation.

Consider that shortly after President Widodo floated his idea on October 30, 2022, on November 15, 2022, the G7 gave Indonesia $20 billion to move away from coal (see here). Then, on December 14, 2022, the G7 gave Vietnam $15 billion too (see here) to do the same. Great Powers are spending a lot to keep commodities and friend-shoring locations in their orbit at affordable prices. One would suspect these ‚Äúoutlays‚Äù are a part of the G7‚Äôs $600 billion earmarked to counter China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative (see here). Here is the point: major amounts of money are being mobilized to cut off big, fat tail risks to inflation, and to re-emphasize‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶five-year forward five-year breakeven inflation expectations do not price geopolitical risk. I also believe that most inflation traders may not appreciate that the future path of inflation in the West is being ‚Äúbought‚Äù in $15 to $20 billion ‚Äúclips‚Äù one commodity and one region at a time ‚Äì commodity encumbrance is a real risk.

Commodity encumbrance cuts in the other direction too‚Ä¶

Consider that on November 3, 2022, Canada ordered three Chinese firms to exit lithium mining (see here). In simple terms, commodity encumbrance means‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶a total war for the control of commodities.

President Xi‚Äôs ‚Äúnext three to five years‚Äù of implementing the ‚Äúnew paradigm‚Äù and the risks of resource nationalism and ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù means this for G7 rates:

When you look at the yield curve and think about the five-year section and then the forward five-year section, by the time the forward five-year section starts, President Xi may have accomplished his ‚Äúnext three- to five-year‚Äù goal of paying for China‚Äôs oil and gas imports exclusively in renminbi and may have advanced commodity encumbrance by developing downstream petrochemical industries in the Middle East ‚Äúregion‚Äù of Belt and Road and also the rollout of ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt think five-year forward five-year rates are pricing the future correctly: breakevens appear to be blind to geopolitical risks and the likelihood of the above.

If the above scenario won‚Äôt come to pass, it will be due to a big, global fight‚Ä¶

But a fight like that takes time to conclude, and in its wake, forward five-years should still be different. Or maybe not, if yield curve control funds reconstruction, but under that scenario, bond investors will be subject to financial repression‚Ä¶

Five-year forward five-year breakeven inflation expectations now make little sense. For two generations of investors, geopolitics did not matter. This time is different: it‚Äôs time to get real and it‚Äôs time to start pricing the secular end of ‚Äúlowflation‚Äù‚Ä¶

Recognize two things: first, that inflation has been driven by non-linear shocks (a pandemic; stimulus; supply chain issues involving laptops, chips, and cars; post-pandemic labor shortages; and then the war in Ukraine), and second, that inflation forecasts treat geopolitics in the rearview mirror. Don‚Äôt be too DSGE‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶think about inflation with geopolitics, resource nationalism, and ‚ÄúBRICS coin‚Äù in mind as the next set of non-linear shocks that will keep inflation above target, forcing central banks to hike interest rates above 5% and keep them high as they‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶‚Äúclean up‚Äù the inflation mess caused by Great Power conflict.

Compared to the outdoor markets in Europe and the USA, the development of China's outdoor market is still in its infancy. However, domestic consumers have gradually accepted and started incorporating outdoor-related equipment and supplies into their lives, providing this market with great potential. In addition, due to the emergence of extreme weather and severe power restrictions in overseas countries and regions, the demand for mobile energy storage equipment will further expand. 

Fujian Solar is a new energy product development and production enterprise, and its portable energy storage product, Venus Power, has become popular and sold widely in China as soon as it was launched. Venus Power features high power, versatile adaptability, outdoor LED lighting compatibility, cell phone wireless charging, PD fast charging and solar panel charging, among others.

Therefore, this device is capable of fully adapting to the market development of current diversified electricity demand from both home use and travelling abroad. 

Hechun Wei, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, ""This entry into the new energy market has been a part of the company's strategy and an important step up in 2023. The entry will further consolidate the Company's market position, improve brand awareness and benefit shareholders.",#WETG: WeTrade Group Pushes Further into the New Energy Cooperated with Super Solar EnergyüöÄüöÄ,1672326750

497,StockMarket,"Investors betting against Tesla Inc. are getting the big bonanza they have been waiting for, with the electric-vehicle maker set to record its worst annual performance on record.

Short sellers in the company ‚Äî or bearish investors who stand to gain when an asset‚Äôs price falls ‚Äî are poised to reap mark-to-market profits of about $17 billion, making Tesla the most profitable short trade of the year, data from S3 Partners shows.

Tesla has tumbled more than 42% in December alone, driving it to a loss of 68% this year ‚Äî marking a radical about face for a stock that surged during the low-rate era of the pandemic.

It‚Äôs a rare victory for the shorts, whose 89% return comes after several years of significant losses, S3‚Äôs Ihor Dusaniwsky said. About 2.9% of Tesla‚Äôs free float is held short, according to S3 data.

Tesla has faced a tumultuous year, with investors fleeing risk assets over concerns about geopolitical uncertainty, high inflation, rising interest rates and a possible recession. Add to that worries that Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk‚Äôs focus will be diverted to his recently acquired social-media company, Twitter, just as demand for electric vehicles is set to take a hit.

Dusaniwsky expects short selling to persist until the stock reaches a bottom. But analysts and investors are still struggling to see a bottom, especially as the company is due to report fourth-quarter delivery numbers early next month and has been offering large buyer incentives.

Tesla shares rose 3.5% in premarket trading on Thursday.

Even if share price begins to recover, its notorious volatility could continue to linger, according to S3‚Äôs Dusaniwsky.

‚ÄúWhen Tesla‚Äôs stock begins to tick upwards, there should be a flurry of short covering which will help boost its stock price higher and quicker as shorter-term short sellers look to realize their outsized mark-to-market profits before they evaporate,‚Äù he said.

Tesla (TSLA) short sellers and bearish investors are poised to profit of about 17 billion, making it the most profitable short trade of the year according to S3 Partners, as the EV giant is set to record its worst year ever.

501,StockMarket,"After shares of Tesla dipped by more than 10% on Tuesday deepening a year-long selloff, CEO Elon Musk told employees not to be ‚Äútoo bothered by stock market craziness.‚Äù

Musk circulated the comments on Wednesday in a companywide email, which CNBC obtained. He told staffers that Tesla needs to ‚Äúdemonstrate continued excellent performance,‚Äù and that ‚Äúlong-term, I believe very much that Tesla will be the most valuable company on Earth!‚Äù

Electric vehicle blog Electrek reported earlier on the email.

Tesla shares have declined about 68% for the year, though they rose 3.3% on Wednesday to $112.71. The stock is down 42% in December, and is poised to close out its worst month, quarter and year on record.

Musk has blamed Tesla‚Äôs declining share price in part on rising interest rates. But critics point to his Twitter takeover as a bigger culprit for the slide, which has wiped out about $675 billion in market cap this year as of Wednesday‚Äôs close.

In the email, Musk thanked Tesla employees for their work in 2022, encouraged them to push hard for a strong fourth-quarter finish, and asked them to ‚Äúvolunteer to help deliver‚Äù cars to customers before midnight on Dec. 31, if at all possible.

During the last days of most quarters, Tesla enlists employees from all over the company to bring new cars to customers in order to hit or exceed stated delivery goals, work that in normal times is limited to people on the sales and delivery teams. The company has been aiming for 50% year-over-year growth in vehicle deliveries but has cautioned investors it may not meet that target every year.

Musk‚Äôs attention has been focused on Twitter of late. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO sold tens of billions of dollars worth of shares in his electric vehicle company in 2022 to finance the $44 billion buyout of the social media company.

Is this really a thing? 

TSMC‚Äôs major clients includes Apple and Nvidia, but looking at AAPL and NVDA‚Äôs revenues, the growth has decreased significantly.

526,StockMarket,"This can be a cautionary tale, or something which the analysts amongst you will help me with by criticizing my take and give advice.

I started trading this year with 1000euro. I know, small sum for everyone's perspective here, but i didn't went out with a goal set to become rich. No. Not at all. I just wanted make some money I can use to take flights back home every year, without spending more than what I am investing in the market.

Basically, I wanted to turn my 1000 to 1600 then take out the 600 which I'd use to buy a roundtrip. Well... My current valuation is at 623 euro. 

So, here is how I started...
Meta was falling apart and knowing how it will DEFINITELY swing back I invest 1000 in Meta... Day one... I see the stock prices going down I started reading all about market and projections and what not and all i can understand Meta will be dead and hence I have dumped my money in wrong stock, i saw the market close in red and thought I'll cash out the next morning. And I did. I make 20 euro profit. Now I had 1018 euro cash i could use for trading i learnt how Paypal is supposed to climb up this year and did my math and realized I'd make 1400 by the end of year, i can add 200 and get my roundtrip.

Well, the prices started coming down and I got afraid next day I cashed out and had 1004 in cash.

Now i just wanted to learn the market and see what stocks will obviously always be going up. I bought ONE stock of tesla (before the split) and held on to it for 2 days. Tesla's quarterly was about to come out and projections said I'd make 200 in profit. The report came out and nothing moved, so i sold the stock and immediately after that the Twitter shit show began, tesla stock shot upto 1040 euro per stock which would have made me a profit of 50 euro, but i was already out. 

I decided, not to do this anymore, just buy something reliable and keep it. By the end of year I'll make SOMETHING... 

I bought Nvidia, and AMD.

the last stock purchases I made. And then the market decided, not to go up even ONCE after that.

I never made my roundtrip.

Learn whatever you can from my mistakes. Teach me what you can if you can. I learnt to probably never trust the projections.

Nearest support remains the bottom of the glaf at 374.77 -- with another support level immediately below at 374.13 gap-fill (which price missed on December 22nd). Moderate support should come at 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd. Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to Octover 13th pivot low. Nearest resistance is 389.63 gap fill with major resistance at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill. Max upside is around 403 within the current channel.

**QQQ:** 11th day down on the current move.  Since 262.46 did not hold &amp; today's candle closed below, the former support TL is now a resistance level.  Nearest support remains 259.08 the previous pivot low; because price is moving near-directly to this level, it should offer moderate support.  If not, major support remains the 254.26 double bottom from Octovber 13th.  If price turns higher, nearest resistance is mot certainly that aforementioned ascending TL.  If price manages to get through that level, there is moderate resistance immediately above at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st. Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.

**IWM:** 8x days into this bear flag, and of note, a daily close below 170.67 the flag low; a close below 170.34 will validate the breakdown tomorrow.  Next support of 169.11 the pre-COVID high will offer minimal support since the bear flag consolidated price just above the level.  Major support is around 162.50 triple bottom from June, September, and October lows. If price turns higher, nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's high. Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th. Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL.

Due to the outbreak of COVID after China's recent lifting of COVID policy, Tesla faced severe labor shortage problem in its Shanghai Facility. Followed by the WSJ report on production halt, Tesla slumped another 11% on Tuesday. However, since the lack of workforce is a temporary impact, and China is quickly passing the peak stage of the pandemic, a potential rebounce might be witnessed soon.

I started investing recently and made a bit too fast decision to invest in C3.AI.

After a bit more research, the company seems a bit scammy and I don't really believe this stock turning profitable.

Some other of stocks i bought are also down, but those are companies i have much more trust in and their business model makes much more sense to me, so i don't mind.

The C3.AI is at its biggest low since 5 years and I'm at around 20% loss.

I expect it to just keep going down and my intuition tells me to sell it now and cut loss, but I'm just a beginner and would like to hear other people opinion.

From the SPX daily chart, it‚Äôs a shooter with low volume. Traders are still enjoying the Christmas and New Year holidays, and buy power is not strong.

From 15 minutes chart, support level is around 3800, resistance level is around 3850. Yesterday SPX failed to fill the gap, it will be more like a sideways trend in 2022 last three trading days.

588,StockMarket,"Tesla is down like crazy recently. Yesterday TSLA was down 11.41%, marked the 7th consecutive red days, it‚Äôs probably due to the production cut of Shanghai factory in December and January. 

[TSLA trading volume daily](https://preview.redd.it/9rz5vxhsem8a1.png?width=722&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=340ea96c85f70a03efe45735c97f3b7fe751767c)

Since the start of December, TSLA is down 45% with increased volumed after mid-December. The trading volume of Tuesday is remarkable considering the subpar trading volume of the main indices. And with that volume and that % change, TSLA is not seen any sign of slowing down in near term. 

[TSLA daily basis support](https://preview.redd.it/frbeodjuem8a1.png?width=1470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00d49eb28496047b009acdf07383e4289f08981e)

The next technical support level I found is around 91.52, which was tested and confirmed more than TWO years ago. But comparing the cars of TSLA competitors, TSLA cars are not attractive to me, they are not as competitive as it was couple years ago. If TSLA don‚Äôt come out with any new models or revise current models to be more competitive to their peers, the sales as well as the price of TSLA are going to decrease as the competition go intense. So personally, I don‚Äôt think this 91.52 support is enough to stop the downward momentum, if that support is broken, then the next support I am looking for is around 60.84.","TSLA is not going to stop, more rooms till the bottom",1672225350

605,StockMarket,"Hello Traders, here is my analysis for why I believe TESLA (and others) had another day of large selling.

\- To start, the broader market as a whole only sold off a small percentage today, around 1% to 2% for most stocks. So why is it that Tesla once again sold off almost 12% in a single day?

\- Well to be clear, Tesla was just one of the names in a particular group of stocks that saw heavy selling today, what do these stocks all have in common? They're ""Hype Stocks."" (Meme stocks)

What are ""Hype Stocks"", they're a group of stocks that retail traders hyped up in 2020-2021 and bought in mass, pushing these stocks into having insane P/E ratios and being incredibly overvalued.

\- What stocks accompanied Tesla in today's sell off? TESLA -12%, NVDA -7%, AMC -8.5%, GAMESTOP -9% and COINBASE -8% just to name a few.

\- Being as these stocks all belong under the classification of ""Hype Stocks"" and all sold off heavily compared to the rest of the market, there's an obvious confluence between the type of investor who was selling.

\- Given this, it is a clear indication that these investors are starting to panic, which is the reason for the selling.

So now you might be wondering... why aren't investors buying at these discounted levels?

\- The reason is simple, big investors are still in the process of end of year tax loss selling, and in addition these investors do not want their clients to see that they have stocks such as TESLA in their portfolio at the moment.

The good news is, the January Effect is just around the corner

\- The January effect is where the heavily sold off stocks who endured tax loss selling, rally in January due to their being more buyers in the market than sellers.

\- So for names such as TESLA which has been incredibly beaten down and no investor wants to buy until the new year, we will likely see TESLA rally in after the new year.

To summarize...

\- Retail traders who bought these stocks off Hype in 2020-2021 are panicking and dumping their shares, while big investors do not want to buy until after the new year.

609,StockMarket,"Some of the bagholders will not like reading this, but Elon hype is dead, it's over. I am sorry but this is it. You know how stockmarket works, once a hype is gone it's gone. Nobody will ever believe him again. Even if he goes to Mars now, or sends 100 tesla to the orbit, doesn't matter. He will be remembered as doge scammer, pump &amp; dumper, liar etc. his ego has taken over his identity and morality.

Look, majority of humans have this weakness that when large amounts of money enter their life, they lose their minds. They become arrogant, power-hungry, lose humility, their very identity and morality. They start to play mini-God and surround themselves with yes-man, and if their mini-God status ever gets challenged, they go mad and not shy away to use illegal ways that they did not use at the beginning of their story.

Just look around you. I am sure you have a couple friends who become rich from a lucky hit on stockmarket, family inheritence or through early bitcoin or some other way. I am not exaggerating, 99% of the time you will see same story happening. The guy that was your best friend years ago that you could argue any subject no longer tolerates to hear you oppose them anymore. He has more money so in his mind he is more ""successful"" so that makes him ""right"" on everything. He no longer seeks friends who tell the truth to their face, he seeks people who admires his supreme intelligence and supreme decisions.

I admired Elon Musk when he had Mars landing presentations etc. people believed he is the new kid on the block with crazy ideas for humanity's progression. I admired Bill Gates before he became the vaccine lord and started to dictate how people should live their lives. I was a Binance user for a long time and I admired CZ. CZ is no longer same person as first time Binance was launched. He has a very similar story like many others that started humble and promising, only to end up as corrupted as any other dictator.

Bottom line is that: Do not over-idolize anyone, not Warren Buffet, not Vitalik etc. anyone I mean anyone regardless of how genius or humble they seem today. Very very few people don't lose their minds when large amounts of money enter their life, and props to those who still keep their feet on the ground. But at the end everyone is just human and prone to same weaknesses. That is why history keeps repeating itself over and over again.

If by chance that you do get rich one day from this capitalism's game of stonks remember where it started and remember who was with you when you had nothing. Having some self principles and self virtues will keep your ego in check and keep your feet on the ground.",Do not over-idolize anyone...,1672195407

617,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**:  All 3x majors continue to behave decidedly bearish.  SPY and IWM are maturing their bear flags, while QQQ continues to grind lower.  As expected, extremely light volume (even compared to last week).  The fact this light volume did not float higher shows how negative the overall market sentiment is with retail/small investors (who are likely making up the majority of this price action; institutions are largely out this week).

**SPY**: 7x days into this bear flag; price remained within Friday's candle.  Nearest support at 374.13 gap-fill which price missed on December 22nd.  Mid-support is 368.79 the pivot from November 3rd.  Major support at 360 from a TL connecting the COVID-low to Octover 13th pivot low.  Nearest resistance is  389.63 gap fill with major resistance at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill.  Max upside is around 403 within the current channel.

https://preview.redd.it/5pw5v4ezci8a1.jpg?width=2299&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=537644789a4a90306bb754ddc18e53a163fa8e21

**QQQ:** Price continues to grind lower; 262.46 must hold on a daily closing basis for the former support TL to not become a resistance TL.  If that level cannot hold, then 259.08 is nearest support.  Major support is the 254.26 double bottom from Octovber 13th.  Nearest resistance is the aforementioned ascending TL, then moderate resistance at 274.78 pivot high from December 21st.  Major resistance is 286.51 gap-fill, which is still below the channel's descending upper TL.

https://preview.redd.it/nfojvd39ei8a1.jpg?width=2297&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b0e471c70a695e45b1bb6c876bac3a7f4fd7d9

**IWM:** 7x days into this bear flag; price remained within Friday's candle.  Nearest support is 170.68 the flag's low.  Moderate support is around the 169 pre-COVID high.  Major support is 162.76 triple bottom  from June, September, and October lows.  Nearest resistance is 176.80 the flag's high.  Major resistance is 180.19 the gap-fill from December 14th.  Max upside is around 185 the channel's upper TL.

I executed 3x trades today: 

**Trade**: ADD x2 tranches  
**Type**: LONG  
**Stock**: TSLA  
**Add Price**: 116.45 and 110.00  
**Add Size**: 1.5% total between both tranches  
**New Avg**: 120.99  
**New Size**: 2.5%  
**Thesis**: I added twice because price fell through &amp; to major technical levels.  My cost average is still 'in range' of reasonable targets when the bounce does come.  This situation highlights why I keep position sizes small when trading volatility -- at only 2.5% of my portfolio, I stil have plenty of capital available if price falls further.  My next add(s) will likely be $100 to $90, and will bring my position to 4-5%.  My new target is $130 to 135, but depending on how price returns to that level, $165 is not out of the question...but probabilities no longer favor that initial target.

**Trade**: ENTER  
**Type**: SHORT  
**Stock**: PEP  
**Price**: 183.36  
**Size**: 0.5%  
**Thesis**: From mid-November to mid-December, price saw 3x failed breakouts while trading in upper-range of channel. Most significant is December 13th: significant gap-up, failure to hold above the previous ATH, and major bearish engulfing candle.  Since December 15th, price has formed a bear flag. I entered a small 0.5% position because 1) light holiday volume should cause price to float higher naturally; but more importantly 2) the gap-up this morning above the 20 DMA.  I will add another tranche a 186.50 -- then use a upper channel  TL tag to add a 3rd tranche depending on how price moves into that level.  Depending on the overall position size, my first target to cover is the 200 DMA at $172, followed by the lower channel TL at $165.

3. Buy undervalued companies.  There are many companies out there with great financial statements, a trend of growth, but the price must be right.  For example, Amazon shows consistent growth, but at their current price and how much net income they are bringing in and P/E ratio, it will take many decades for them to make enough money to warrant that current price evaluation.
 
4. You only need a few very good companies to get rich.  People that diversify don‚Äôt know what they are doing, so they try to mitigate risk.  But to get wealthy, you go all in only a few stocks that you have thoroughly researched and meets all the criteria stated above.  People that get very rich, they do it off only a few stocks.  You want all your money in a good company where when it moves, it moves in a big way.  Enough to move the needle.
 
5. Have a strategy, once you know the top 5 companies you are going to invest in, the price fluctuation doesn‚Äôt matter as much anymore.  It will go up and down periodically, but each time it goes down, you need to buy more.  Load up as much as you can when the price is low.  You are betting on your research and confidence that 10 years from now this company will grow many folds.  It‚Äôs hard to predict in the short term whether a stock going to go up or or down, but I can predict with high certainty that a stock will go up in 10 years.  
 
6. Stock investing is simple.  If a company is profitable and consistently brings in profit, the stock will grow and so will your money.
 
7. Ignore the micro / temporary issues in society.  For example, covid, new politician, fear of war, Ukraine invasion etc.  All this does not matter, it‚Äôs only temporary. A good company that historically shown to make profits and grow, they will overcome and continue to grow the long run.
 
8. Do not invest money if you need the money in the short run.  For example you need the money in a week a month or even a year.  Stock investing is long run, most big profits are made in year 6 or higher.  You need to be able to buy and hold for 10 years to see substantial increases.
 
9. Do not invest in speculative stocks.  Don‚Äôt invest in the story, for example ‚Äúmarijuana stocks‚Äù is the future, or electric cars or renewable energy is the future.  Only invest in companies that you can check their financial statement and see they have a trend of growth.  Not saying to invest in well established companies that are profitable, but you need to find a company that you look at the financial statements and pick up a trend of growth.  NIO is an example of a good stock that has shown growth.  Although they are still not in the green on net income yet, they show a trend of increasing revenue each year, closing the gap on the net income to be profitable and each year they are producing more cars and expanding their markets.  
 
10. Remove the prejudice in your investing strategy.  Don‚Äôt be prejudice because you don‚Äôt like investing in oil, or because it‚Äôs from China you don‚Äôt like Chinese people, or you don‚Äôt like investing in companies that start with the letter A.  All that does not matter, you are here to make money.   Invest wisely by analyzing the financial statement and where the trajectory of that company is going.
 
11. Never sell a stock when it‚Äôs low.  If you invest in good companies stated above, these companies has always recovered and increase their stock price significantly after the turmoil.  
 
12. Invest in companies that has room to grow.  Think of stock investing like how many innings in a baseball game.  Ask yourself, where is this company now, is it in the 1st inning or is it in the 9th inning.  For example Amazon, ask yourself where is this company at in it‚Äôs life, is this company now fully matured, do they still have room to grow? In my opinion, Amazon is near the full maturity stage, it‚Äôs in the 7th inning, there‚Äôs not much more room for it to expand or grow.  But Alibaba, is the 2nd biggest competitor to Amazon, and it shows a great financial statement and the trajectory of it to grow is still quite high.  They are consistently getting more active user each year and the market they are in, which is China still has a lot of room to grow.
 
13. Do not options trade, it‚Äôs gambling.  It‚Äôs hard to predict a stock going up or down in the short run.  To ensure high probability of success, buy good, undervalued companies and hold long run.

# [Stock futures rise heading into the final trading week of 2022](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/26/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose on Tuesday as the final trading days of 2022 kicked off and investors hoped a Santa Claus rally will appear and lift a market that has been weighed down by recession fears.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose by 160 points, or 0.48%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively.
*****
&gt; During the regular session Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 176 points higher, or 0.5%. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Friday marked the start of the time period for a Santa Claus rally, which is typically considered the final five-day trading stretch in the current year, as well as the first two trading days in the new year. Markets were closed Monday for the Christmas holiday.
*****
&gt; Due to low trading volumes, investors are expecting either relative quiet or further volatility during the holiday-shortened week. Markets are closing out a month and year defined by a surge in recession fears.
*****
&gt; In December, the S&amp;P 500 dropped roughly 5.8%, while the Dow and Nasdaq dropped about 4% and 8.5%, respectively. These are the biggest monthly declines since September. The major averages are headed for their worst annual performance since 2008.
*****
&gt; ‚Ä≥[The] question of what kind of recession remains unanswered,‚Äù Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, wrote Friday. ‚ÄúAnd for this, the answer is dictated primarily from how much more the Fed needs to raise rates to finally tackle sticky inflation.‚Äù
*****
&gt; On the economic front, traders are expecting the latest data on November wholesale inventories and the October S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home prices Tuesday before the bell.

This small amount of coverage had little if any impact on the stock price Friday, which quickly fell 20 cents on opening but climbed steadily back to its original position. From some quick research, I‚Äôve learned that government contract awards rarely impact stock price except when the award is very large (which this contract is, and fixed-price contracts are more impactful than cost-plus contracts). This odd effect is due in part at least to insufficient efforts made to push the news to media outlets.

**TLDR**

&amp;#x200B;

* They make a ton of recommendations. Many products underperform the market
* Their annual Top 10 list did great in 2021 but not 2022, but you pay for it at $3600 per year. You can get a base subscription for $249/yr for just the stock screeners which is reasonable, though many are baked into Fidelity‚Äôs platform for free.
* Their stock screeners are great for finding stocks, especially the VGM and Zacks Rank #1 screener. But to do it right, you need to spend 5hrs a week on it seeing what‚Äôs new.

Zacks offers a couple dozen different lines of stock picking services plus a few dozen different stock screens. It‚Äôs quite overwhelming actually, but also a bit addictive to pour through them to find some good stocks. I found most of their services don‚Äôt outperform the market or have so many stocks in them it would be a full-time job to buy and manage them.

For most of the screeners, the time it takes to vet them and look at each of the 50 plus stocks in each is too much of a time commitment, but looking at the first few in the list gives some ideas of what is working.I started just looking at the recent additions to see if there were secular trends and that helped.

I tried out some of their healthcare picks with mild success: I was going to share the names but the bots on here blocked them because they are under 300M market cap. One was bought out for 40% over purchase price. One went up 6X. Two fizzled down -70%. If you want the names DM me.

I did OK using the value, growth, and momentum stock screener but I really had to spend a lot of time separating out the good ones and figuring out what was recently added, which they don‚Äôt tell you. If you get them too late, the move has already occurred and you will likely see the stock correct quickly.

A few gems I traded from their list around March of 2021 included SEM (health clinics), DAC (container shipping), BERY (financial), and MT (steel). My target was +100% for each and I made that within a year of buying for each. I bought options. HOLX was an exception. I lost -15% on that pick, though it was mostly due to the fact it soared high from COVID revenues and then sold off quickly as the vaccines rolled out. It‚Äôs since back to slightly above the purchase price.

**Zacks Top 10 Stocks of 2021 -** their premium offering and associated returns. I did not buy all of these - only SPSC and PWR. But I did track them all in a watchlist.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Percent Winner Rate: 90%**
* **Avg return: 48%**
* **SPY Return: 30%**

 Return: -6%

**For 2022‚Äôs top 10 stocks,** the advice has not been quite so good, but the year isn‚Äôt over yet. I didn‚Äôt buy any this year because I was short on the market, but I have been tracking the performance to see if they can match what they did last year. So far, not so good.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Percent Up Since Rec: 20%**
* **Avg Return of Rec: -8.8%**
* **SPY Return: -10.3% as of time I drafted**

**2. LEVELFIELDS**

**TLDR**:

&amp;#x200B;

* Event-driven alerts work and I like that the success rate is visible on the website
* There are a lot of alerts you can subscribe to, so it‚Äôs best to choose one of their lower volume, higher performing strategies to avoid opportunity overload
* It‚Äôs good at finding high shorter term returns with high success rates
* For the biggest companies (AAPL, TSLA, etc), my news alerts arrived faster. For those under 100B market cap, it's very helpful.
* Price is 228/yr but their emails of a big update seem to be hinting a hike is coming soon

**Winning Percent: 79%**

**Avg Return/Trade: 23%**

I‚Äôve been using an event-driven research system called LevelFields for about a year now. It was a little rough around the edges in the early days but has gotten much better over time. It‚Äôs good at identifying news events early that drive stock prices up and down, often from direct announcements from companies. It shows stock patterns following events, which is cool, especially for the negative events so you can see how far the stock will probably fall.

They effectively filter the noise out of the news and just focus on a couple dozen event types that really shake stock prices: hedge fund investor moves, layoffs, shorts, FDA approvals, leadership changes, Amazon new product launches, and a couple dozen other types. Unlike the technical pattern alert systems out there I‚Äôve seen, it focuses on real news, which I like, as I feel pattern trading is often a lot like staring at clouds and making shapes out of them in your mind.

For the big companies everyone watches, they don‚Äôt beat news alerts. But for the bulk of the companies you‚Äôve never heard of or have forgotten about, it flags a lot of opportunities and companies on the rise.

Most of the time I trade with the information. Sometimes I use it to find stocks for longer term plays. Like Zacks, they put out a lot of opportunities so any analysis here is going to be biased by what I‚Äôm choosing to act on. But they publish the success rate and show all past alerts so the past performance is embedded in the platform under each strategy, which is nice.

The winning rates for their strategies range from a high of 90% to a low of 50%, with most in the 70% range. You can alter the outcomes by adjusting the filters for the types of stocks. I don‚Äôt like to buy commodities and microcaps generally, as the prices fluctuate too much on factors beyond the company‚Äôs control, so I filter those out.

Lately, I‚Äôve been trading on their layoffs scenario, which tracks companies firing people. If you filter for just expensive stocks that are firing people to grow earnings, you can get to 80% accuracy in price prediction. I‚Äôve noticed some events cause the share prices to pop right away, so I often wait for the first selloff before entering the trade.

**Here are the alerts I opted to act on and how they turned out**. I‚Äôm noting hold times since it‚Äôs not a buy and hold forever system though I supposed you could for some stocks.

10.21.21 - Qualcomm. Return: stock rose +50% in 1 month. Traded options for +300% gain.  
 11.11.21 - Northern Gas (NOG). Return: +45%. I held for 5 months.  
 12.9.21 - CVS. return: +60% in 1 month (options)  
 11.18.21 - BLDR. Return: +67% in 4 days (options)  
 12.04.21 Signature Bank SBNY. Return: +16% in 1 month. I then traded a couple more times on it as it was doing well until the Crypto crash. It holds a lot of staked Bitcoin.

12.6.21 Silicon Motion (SIMO). +25% in 2 months. Still like this semi and will buy back. They do memory chips and had been killing it. It was hard to find a cheap semi at one point but this one always traded at a reasonable p/e.

12.9.21 Labcorp (LH): +8% in 1 month but I held it too long and exited down -10% due to covid rates dwindling and testing volumes decreasing

12.15.21 - Broadcom (AVGO). Return: 0% Sold off when war started.  
 2.3.22 - Quest (DGX). Return: +50% in 1 month via option trade  
 2.15.22 - Upstart (UPST): Return: +30% on options in 1 week. I had owned this stock already and was trading it off and on for about a year..

2.17.22 Blocked by mod bots from showing: +50% in 2 days  
 2.24.22 - ALSN (Allison Transmission ). Return: +8% in 1 month  
 3.11.22 - Applied Materials (AMAT). Return: +4% in a week.  
 3.17.22 - Lockheed Martin (LMT): Return: +70% in 3 weeks (option trade on news Germany was buying planes)

3.17.22 - CMC Steel. Return: +10% in 1 month

3.31.22 - LGVN. Return: +20% in 1 day.  
 5.9.22 - TWTR. Return +100% on puts in 1 mo. This was the ‚ÄúElon will back out‚Äù trade a big hedge fund was betting on, so I joined them. A short would‚Äôve worked too.

5.24.22 - Digital Ocean (DOCN): Returns TBD. Up 8% on equity but I‚Äôm selling covered calls for an extra 20% annually. I really like this company. It‚Äôs like a mini AWS that is more cost effective for small businesses.

6.15.22 - Space company. +50% in two days

6.24.22 - Digital Turbine (APPS). +31% in 2 months. I think this was mostly luck given the timing of the bear market rally.

6.28.22 - Alibaba (BABA). -30% on options in 3 weeks. Can‚Äôt seem to get a break on BABA.

7.14.22 - Pinterest (PINS). +30% on hedge fund moves

7.27.22 - Mining company. return: -10% on option puts. Still puzzled why the stock is up.

7.28.22 +4% and holding. They are one of the only medicines for monkeypox.  
 8.12.22 - Peloton (PTON). +10% in a day on its layoff news

8.15.22 -3%. It makes solar cells in China and is growing revenues by triple digits.

**3. THE FOOL**

I resisted trying out the Fool for years because they wrote so many articles and ads touting their stock picks that I assumed they had to be full of it. But, when I had enough money in the account, I decided to try it out and see if they maybe could save me some time finding stocks early or if they were the cause of certain pump and dumps I was watching.

**TLDR**:

&amp;#x200B;

* They pick good, overvalued growth stocks but they don‚Äôt try to time the market at all because they want 5 year hold times, which can lead to big drawdowns while you wait
* I would‚Äôve lost a fortune had I taken much of their advice. However, if you have a decade long time horizon and can stomach 75% pullbacks, the stocks they recommend will probably come out ahead
* They repurpose recommendations from different subscription tiers, often using lower tier recs to increase the returns of higher level subscriptions
* They make a lot of recommendations. It‚Äôs time consuming to keep up.
* Big range of prices from $100/yr to $5,000/yr and they upsell a lot

They had a lot of subscription options to choose from that range from a hundred bucks or so a year to $5K per year. I signed up for a few of them, including their stock advisor, IPO one, and cloud innovators and small caps service. I should note that the lists they provide overlap enormously, so they clearly repurpose their recommendations and charge you more to get the same recs again and again.

For the cloud services recommendations, I found they generally picked out solid growth companies (DOCN, DOCU, ESTC,etc) but too late, after the stocks were already richly valued. So I traded them instead of buying them. Below are the email recommendations they sent out I saved.

I kept emails of other recommendations, though I admit this list is not complete since they only sent emails containing the rec half the time. The rest of the time they send you to their website to watch a 30-minute webinar of their picks in the middle of the work day, which was strange to me and defeated my purpose of saving time digging through stock screeners. I tracked from the next day‚Äôs opening price.

**4. INVESTORS PLACE**

**TLDR:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Mostly recommend long-term, long shot stocks
* Best recommendations are free. Most paid recommendations are mediocre at best
* News is wrong sometimes
* They are good at spotting long-term trends in where the new money is flowing to, e.g. thematic investing (online gambling, EVs, rare minerals, etc). I derived value from seeing companies linked to these trends I may not have heard of otherwise.

They make an obscene amount of recommendations across their blog and have many subsidiary newsletter services and promotional picks, so my tracking here is admittedly biased, as I only tracked what I ended up buying. Like Fool, they have a very long investing horizon and may end up being right‚Ä¶years from now. They make recommendations based on thematic trends, e.g. EVs, cybersecurity, etc. However, they also push recommendations based on events or news.

I signed up for Matt McCall‚Äôs Investment Opportunities and followed their website recommendations. The newsletter divided up stock recommendations along long-term thematic investing trends like AI, 5G, EVs, online gambling, precious metals, crypto, data analytics, etc).

Their basic principal is long-term investing along big emerging trends. There were about 50 stocks or so in the portfolio at any given time, but since they do long-term investing, many had been in there for years and they offered no advice on how to enter a trade they had entered 4 years ago. So I never did.

Here are the ones they recommended as buys that I actually bought:

**Pct of Recommendations Up: 27%**

**AVG Return**: Not able to calculate this since I didn‚Äôt take advice to hold long term for most

EV Maker. Return: -100%

I purchased some call options in this EV company (name blocked by mods) because they made an announcement the company was a shoe-in to get an $8B EV supplier contract with the U.S. Postal Service. They claimed there were no other competitors that made EVs and therefore this would be a game changer for the company. I didn‚Äôt do my own due diligence, stupidly. A few weeks later, the award went to Oshkash, a defense contractor most known for making military vehicles. Oshkash[ partnered](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36826291/ford-supplier-usps-postal-truck/) with Ford on the contract to make the EVs. I lost 100% of my call options on this poorly sourced news piece.

7.15.21. Buy SWBI. Smith and Wesson: -40% since then. I sold it when there was a pop for breakeven returns after a shooting, which triggered an increase in price, sadly.

1.4.21 Buy Chinese Pharma. Return: -48%

The return here has not been good as of late but it was up and I‚Äôm holding anyway as this company is the gatekeeper for a lot of large Pharmaceutical companies (Novartis, AstraZeneca, Amgen) to get into the Chinese market. In my view, it was a good recommendation and was largely up until recently.

1.21.21. BUY (Block by mod bots): Return: +100% or 0% Correctly predicted the stock would double. It did, then gave up 100% of its gains. Glad I sold it when it doubled.

1.22.21 Buy ad company (blocked by mods). Return: -76%. My stop loss triggered at -12%.

2.1.21 Blocked by mod bots (rare earth minerals company). Return: +32% This was a good pick. I actually bought on the rec and made about 50% from trading options and selling covered calls. I would not have known about this stock without them. I plan to buy it back at 25. They are one of the few providers of the rare earth minerals in every electronic outside of China.

2.4.21 Buy ACAD - Acadia Pharmaceuticals. Return: -71%. Their report cited 30% revenue growth and a robust pipeline of drugs. Revenue is around 17% growth now. At one point it had doubled in value. I‚Äôm still holding. My lesson learned: trade biotechs, don‚Äôt hold them.

2.5.21 Buy REDACTED BY MODS. Return: -60%

Straight downhill since the recommendation. Touted as a cutting edge AI/Machine learning data analytics company I bought 100 shares. Revenues are up 50% y/y but I sold it in February 2022 for a -20% loss.

2.10.21 Buy rare earth minerals company. Return: +69%

Another good pick in a sector I knew nothing about prior to their recommendation. I have since sold it but was up +60% when I closed out. I will buy it again at some point when commodity prices have cooled.

Feb 2021 Buy ILMN (Illumina - genetics company). Return since: -49% They pushed this stock hard and it tanked after each[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/ilmn-stock-will-be-unstoppable-once-the-grail-acquisition-gets-approved/), which made me believe it was a pump and dump job. I traded options on this one and cut losses -28%.

2.19.21. Buy (blocked by mod bots) Return: -94% Thankfully stop lossed this one at -7%.

Feb 26 2021 Buy FTCH (Farfetch 2nd hand clothing): Return: -85% I traded options on this one, using their[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/02/farfetch-stock-buy-the-dip-in-ftch/) as the pump I dumped and made 20%.

2.5.21. Buy (Blocked by mod bots). Return: -72%. Still holding. They offer sports gambling online and were growing revenues 75% y/ but it‚Äôs slowed to 16% growth.

2.10.21 Buy online gambling co (blocked by mods). Return: -15%. Bought this one as the online gambling is doing well. We shall see.

12.17.21 Buy NIO. Return since: -55%. I traded a few options on it but generally think EVs are overvalued and risky given the huge capital expenditures and exposure to macroeconomic issues. I ended up a few percent as I sold after an initial bump.

**$TGTX Price Action Forecast**

1. 75%\~80% chance of FDA approval by 12/28/22
2. If FDA approves the drug:

If FDA requires black box labeling (the less likely case), the upside might be $12\~$15

If FDA requires NO black box labeling (the more likely case), the upside might be $15\~$20

1. If FDA does NOT approve the drug: $TGTX would drop to $4\~$5/share and become a zombie stock
2. We are expecting $150MM sales in 2023, maybe $300MM sales in 2024

If P/E ratio= 20,

then $23/share is a fair market value in 2H 2023

then $42/share is a fair market value in 2H 2024

**The Risk of Investing TGTX Here**

1. FDA does NOT approve this drug. We only see the data that $TGTX management told us, but not the data they submitted to FDA
2. FDA might haven't inspected $TGTX production facility due to work-from-home situations like we have seen in the $VERU FDA approval case this year, causing the PDUFA date to be delayed
3. Even if TG-1101 is approved, marketing will be difficult.
4. insurance coverage and fees will be the critical part. Plus $TGTX doesn't have enough sales and marketing experience compared to large pharma
5. The first few months of sales will be slow until the insurance J Code assigned
6. Competitors
7. Management: The CEO asked for $40M compensation last year

Buffet cites the recent announcement by Procter &amp; Gamble (PNG) regarding its use of derivatives, which began as interest rate swaps but eventually involved writing puts on large quantities of bonds. Buffet notes that the use of derivatives, which involve borrowing large amounts of money and the potential for either making a lot of money or losing a lot quickly, has historically led to trouble.

688,StockMarket,"***Breaking Down JPM's 71 Page 2023 Equity Derivatives Outlook, I Summarize the Main Themes For You And Drill Down Into The Details On US Equity And Volatility Markets &amp; Trade Recommendations***

## Outlook For Markets And Volatility

* Until recently, it was thought that a soft landing and upturn in the economic cycle would follow the significant increase in interest rates and global geopolitical uncertainty
* However, this view has been abandoned due to further market and economic weakness potentially occurring as a result of central bank overtightening
* The outlook for the market in 2023 includes two periods: market turmoil and economic decline that will force a pivot, followed by an economic and asset recovery
* The timing and severity of the downturn is uncertain, but financial markets may react sooner and more violently than the economy itself
* The pivot, which will coincide with peak short-term rates, USD, and market volatility, will require central banks (primarily the Fed) to signal cutting rates
* This pivot may be prompted by economic deterioration, an increase in unemployment, market volatility, a decline in risky assets, and a decline in inflation
* The market turmoil and subsequent reversal may happen between now and the end of Q1 2023
* Risks to this view include consumer and corporate resilience pushing the downside market scenario to late 2023, or a sharp near-term decline in inflation prompting a Fed pivot without significant economic damage

## U.S. Market Recap &amp; Outlook

* The VIX has averaged around 26 in 2022, up from an average of around 19.5 in 2021
* Volatility is expected to remain above its long-term average in 2023, with the VIX averaging around 25 in the baseline forecast scenario
* Volatility is expected to be biased higher in the early part of the year, as equity markets are expected to fall through this year's lows
* The full year average will depend on the timing of central banks pivoting to an easing bias and the duration/depth of any equity market drawdown
* High volatility may occur in the near term, but is not expected to persist for the full year due to a shift in positioning to align with a recessionary environment having already occurred, and central banks expected to pivot to an easing bias
* Volatility in the equity market may also be impacted by a potential re-acceleration of monetary accommodation in response to the global economic recovery, and potentially a shift in the term premium structure of the US yield curve
* Volatility in the currency market may be impacted by a potential unwinding of the reflation trade, a potential shift in central bank policy, and a potential reduction in global liquidity
* Volatility in the fixed income market may be impacted by a potential re-acceleration of monetary accommodation in response to the global economic recovery, and a potential shift in the term premium structure of the US yield curve

&amp;#x200B;

## European Market Recap &amp; Outlook

* The outlook for risk is uncertain due to the prospect of a recession in the Euro area, energy and geopolitical uncertainty, sensitivity to the likelihood and timing of a potential US recession, and lack of clarity on China reopening
* The VSTOXX median level in 2022 was 27.6, higher than expectations, and similar levels are expected in 2023
* The Euro area is expected to enter a mild recession this winter, with the ECB expected to implement a mildly restrictive policy shift in response
* Political risk in Europe is expected to remain contained in the coming year, with reform efforts set on autopilot and limited event risk
* Inflation is expected to moderate and hit the central bank's target in 2024

## Asian Market Recap &amp; Outlook

* The VHSCEI traded above 40 on 30 days in 2022, driven by policy and macro surprises including strict COVID policies, rising geopolitical uncertainty, and delinquency concerns in the real estate sector
* The VHSCEI is expected to average 30 in 2023, down from 33 in 2022, as headwinds to China-related assets dissipate
* The main driver of the China macro outlook will be the economic reopening, which is expected to be a prolonged process with transitional pains
* Geopolitical tensions with the US are expected to remain a long-term risk factor, with interim signs of stabilization possible
* China's unique position in the monetary policy cycle is expected to keep the local stock market relatively resilient from a slowdown in DM economies
* Offshore China markets are expected to remain more volatile than onshore peers, with foreign investors potentially adjusting underweight China positions in favor of Hong Kong listed equities
* Japan equity implied volatility rose modestly in 2022, with the VNKY averaging 22.9
* The VNKY is expected to remain elevated in 2023, with a target of 25, as monetary policy tightening and a slowing macro environment sustain market volatility

# Volatility Supply And Demand

## Impact of Rising Rates On the Equity Derivatives Market

* Structured products in the US and Europe saw outperformance due to rising long-dated interest rates, while Asian markets and Japan saw little impact
* The effect of rates on structured products was particularly pronounced in the US and Europe, with little impact in most Asian markets and none in Japan
* The performance of long-dated, fixed-strike forwards in the US and Europe outperformed spot due to rising interest rates
* The changes in dividend and vega risk in the Euro STOXX 50 were relatively small compared to the peak-to-trough risk change in 2020 and the change in the HSCEI in 2021
* An increase in implied volatility makes autocallables more attractive and capital protected products less attractive, while an increase in forwards makes autocallables less attractive and capital protected products more attractive
* The relative attractiveness of each type of structured product depends on the relative changes between forwards and equity volatility
* The moves in rates and volatility in 2021 impacted the relative attractiveness of principal-at-risk and principal-protected structures in different markets, with principal-protected structures becoming more attractive in the US and Europe and less attractive in Asia due to rising implied volatility and unchanged forwards, while the opposite occurred in Japan due to rising forwards and unchanged implied volatility.
* Shift from autocallables to capital protected products should reduce the supply of long-dated skew over time, due to less selling of OTM Puts to replicate the Knock-In Barrier of the autocallables

# Trends in Supply/Demand

## US - Short-Dated Volatility

* Short-dated S&amp;P 500 volatility was driven by supply of ATM/upside volatility and demand for downside volatility for protection in 2022 - though this flow imbalance was weaker than normal due to a variety of notable factors:
   * Low investor positioning throughout much of the year required less hedging demand (as you only need to hedge what you are long/overweight)
   * Increased demand for calls from underweight investors to hedge right tail risks (equity-replacement strategies)
   * Moderately lower supply from yield generation/volatility risk premium strategies given the increasing yields available from FI vehicles
* Dealer gamma positioning and market volatility were strongly correlated in 2022 due to weak liquidity conditions and the reinforcing effects of dealers' hedging flows.
* The decline in skew to multi-year lows was due to weak investor positioning, the popularity of put options with a volatility knock-out, and the atypical volatility environment.
* Skew is likely to become steep again when investors re-lever and the effect of volatility knock-out options on skew declines.
* Activity in volatility risk premia strategies remained subdued in 2022, after collapsing in 2020 as the COVID volatility spike led many funds to close or pare back activity
* Systematic variance sellers have all but disappeared, leaving convexity risk-premium trading well above pre-pandemic levels

## Retail Trading

* Retail traders continued to be active in the US options market in 2022, but with slightly lower volume compared to 2021
* Retail traders tend to be buyers of ATM options in very short-dated maturities, but sellers in most other parts of the volatility surface
* Trading activity in zero day to expiry (0DTE) options has significantly grown and now makes up over 40% of total contracts traded
* Retail investors are not the main participants in the 0DTE options market
* Most 0DTE options trades are unwound before the end of the day/expiry
* Transaction costs in vega terms for 0DTE options are up to three times as high as longer-dated options
* Outright option returns for 0DTE options are highly profitable shortly after trade initiation, but delta-hedged option returns are unprofitable
* End users of 0DTE options are likely to be directional high frequency traders, while market makers are willing to supply liquidity due to wider bid-ask spreads and can systematically profit from delta-hedged positions
* The biggest impact of 0DTE options comes from the delta at inception, with a small gamma impact due to the short holding periods of these options.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

## Long Dated Volatility

* The supply/demand balance in long-dated US volatility space comes from three primary sources: insurance companies, structured products, and vol spread players
* In recent years, the balance between insurance demand and structured product supply has tipped towards the supply side due to decreased insurance demand and increased structured product issuance
* This has led to gradual pressure on long-dated S&amp;P 500 implied volatility and dividend levels
* Vol spread trading activity declined significantly during the pandemic and has not recovered
* Insurance hedging flows have been in decline in recent years due to a number of VA issuers scaling back or closing their businesses, net flows being negative for several years, and new products being issued with less demand for hedges
* Long-term S&amp;P 500 volatility demand from VA hedgers was subdued in 2022 and fell year-on-year, but there was an opportunistic demand surge late in the year as insurers reloaded on long-dated option hedges
* The adoption of LDTI in 2023 could lead to an uptick in insurance hedging demand, but the impact is likely to be more pronounced on the rates side than in equities
* The structural decline in VA hedging demand is expected to continue, with VA sales forecast to be 10% lower in 2022 than in 2021
* The growth in structured product issuance has led to a surplus of long-dated volatility supply
* Vol spread trading activity is expected to remain low in the near term, with only modest growth expected in the long term
* The balance between insurance demand and structured product supply is expected to continue tilting towards the supply side, leading to further pressure on long-dated S&amp;P 500 implied volatility and dividends

# 2023 US Trade Ideas

## Credit/Equity Relative Value

**Buy a 3M ATM SPY Put vs. Selling 1.7x the Notional in 3M ATM LQD Puts for zero net cost**

&gt;*""In the US HG 2023 Outlook, JPM's credit strategists forecast HG bond spreads to tighten to 155bps, in-line with the 10y average and implying nearly a 10% total return for high-quality credit, as spreads will tighten modestly even as the economy remains weak and may slip into a shallow recession. Specifically, higher quality assets with attractive yields will be in favor in 2023 and the team expects reallocations towards IG corporate credit from previously painful allocations to higher risk alternatives. Conversely, in the 2023 Global Equity Strategy Outlook, JPM's equity strategists expect the S&amp;P500 to retest this year's lows in 1H23 as the Fed overtightens into weaker fundamentals. This sell-off combined with disinflation, rising unemployment, and declining corporate sentiment should be enough for the Fed to start signaling a pivot, subsequently driving an asset recovery.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""Fundamentally, we like how LQD represents the potential upside in high-quality US corporate credit, and remain comfortable selling the expensive, relative implied volatility in LQD to buy cheaper option volatility in SPY. While LQD has fallen 15% YTD, shares have rebounded just over 10% since reaching a YTD low of $99.20 in mid-October, a level LQD has not reached since before 2010. LQD shares represent a high-quality USD IG portfolio, with an average BBB+ rating, 3.7% weighted-average coupon, weighted-average duration of 8.6 years, 5.2% YTW, and a weighted-average bond holding price of around $90. LQD holds IG credits in Financials (31%), Consumer, Non-Cyclical (20%), Communications (13%), and Technology (10%). If central bankers do pivot on interest rate policy next year, investors could view LQD as an attractive alternative to play longer-term interest rates, given LQD's average duration is in-line with the current 10y UST, but with a higher YTW compared to the 10y UST's YTW of 3.6%.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""As S&amp;P 500 consensus earnings fell this year, SPY shares have fallen 13% YTD, but did also rebound over 12% off October lows. However, a further decline in earnings expectations for next year, given continuing weakness in US economic conditions, will provide for increased volatility and equity downside. Contrasting LQD's relative historical cheapness, the S&amp;P 500 currently trades at nearly 20x JPM's Strategists' estimated 2023 earnings of $205, a premium to its 10y average of 16x.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""As illustrated in the figure below, the LQD/SPY 3M Implied Volatility ratio is in its 95th percentile over the past 5 years, though only moderately above the realized volatility ratio, illustrating the relative richness of LQD implied volatility vs. SPY. As such, we recommend selling puts in LQD to fund puts on SPY, premium neutral, to position for our 2023 outlook that sees high-grade corporate credit spreads outperforming US equities into next year.*

[Ratio Between LQD And SPX 3-Month At-the-Forward Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/b4a5t4xjca8a1.png?width=472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6438f5de1105187ceb0df903d10ad0e7d605afea)

# Skew/Convexity Trades

## Monetize the Rich Convexity Risk Premium

**Convexity On The S&amp;P 500 Is Still Trading At Distressed Levels; JPM Recommends Monetizing It**

&gt;*""The implied convexity risk premium, for example measured by the spread between variance swaps and ATMF volatility, surged in early 2020 and has continued to trade at around* ***twice*** *its pre-pandemic levels over the past \~2.5 years, and US indices exhibit among the highest convexity levels across major global indices. As discussed in the Volatility Supply/Demand section, the convexity richness is sustained by tail hedging demand and a dearth of Vol Risk-Premium sellers. While we don't see an immediate catalyst to pressure implied convexity levels lower, selling this Risk-Premium makes for an attractive carry trade to play the Implied-to-Realized spread.*

[1-Year Variance Less At-the-Forward Volatility \(Left\); Ratio of Vol vs. Var Swap \(Right\)](https://preview.redd.it/qy2yswlrca8a1.png?width=990&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23782bff2dc1e91561f34289ad1c7b4e5ea8ed57)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*""Therefore, we recommend monetizing the rich convexity, for example, via the following structures:*  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ñ∫ ***Sell 1x Dec'23 Variance Swap vs. Buying 0.85x The Vega Notional In Dec'23 Vol Swaps On SPX***  
&gt;  
&gt;*""The terminal payout (if held to maturity) is linked solely to the SPX's Realized Volatility over the life of the trade, and rich convexity levels allow investors to obtain a wide breakeven range and elevated maximum payout. We ratio the two legs in order to skew the breakeven range lower. The Variance-Vol swap spread is currently indicatively bid at 3.7 points; this structure allows investors to collect a maximum 3.5 times the Vega Notional if the index realizes near 24%, and returns a positive P/L if realized volatility over the next year falls between 10% and 38%. The structure returns &gt;2 Vega profit if realized volatility falls between 15% and 33.5%. Investors can also consider similar structures on the Russell 2000 and Nasdaq 100, where convexity is similarly rich.*  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ñ∫ ***Buy Dec'23 50% Up-Variance vs. Selling Vanilla Variance On The SPX***  
&gt;  
&gt;*""In this structure, an investor indicatively collects 1.75 Vega of annualized carry as long as the SPX trades above 50% of its starting level (i.e., above a spot price of \~2000). If the SPX dips below this barrier, the investor is naked short variance at a strike of 29, only for the period the index trades below this level.*

&amp;#x200B;

## Relative Value in VIX vs. SPX Tail Hedge

&gt;*""We noticed previously a relative value trade opportunity between VIX and SPX 1M Skew. We apply the same analysis for 3M Skew. As of 12/5/2022, the VIX and SPX 3M Skewness, and 3M Implied and Realized Correlation are shown in the images below. We see that the 3M VIX vs. SPX Skewness difference is on the low end (8th Percentile) with a Z-Score of \~1.37. Also, the implied vs. realized correlation plot shows that implied correlation is on the high end (absolute value) and the correlation spread between implied vs. realized is at around peak. Therefore, VIX Skew is rich, while SPX Skew is cheap - historically speaking. The relative value trade with short VIX OTM Call &amp; long SPX OTM Put is recommended in the image below.*

## Machine Learning Based Dispersion Trades

&gt;*""It is our long-held belief that names with extreme factor exposures are likely to experience higher volatility. One reason is that stock volatility is increasingly attributable to factor rotations, which are in-turn driven by macro factors such as bond yields. 2022 has been an eventful year for the equity market due to the hawkish turn in central bank policies globally. Without pontificating on the future direction of bond yields, we believe that factor driven equity volatility is likely to be sustained for the foreseeable future.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""In this section, we propose a new SPX Dispersion Portfolio constructed using our machine learning based methodology.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***SPX Bespoke Dispersion***  
&gt;  
&gt;*""We propose the following SPX dispersion portfolio, selected from an expanded universe of S&amp;P members with the highest option liquidity. Based on the volatility and fundamental factor data of our stock universe, a weighted portfolio of 30 names is constructed. As a reminder, we optimize the stock selection by jointly maximizing the members' volatility carry and factor exposures. The constituents are seen in the table below.*

&amp;#x200B;

## Vanilla Index Hedges

&gt;*""After the significant rally over the past two months, timing for putting on hedges appears good. JPM's Equity Strategists believe that the most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in decades will cause fundamentals to deteriorate next year, driving a significant fall in corporate earnings as the economy enters recession, labor markets contract, and consumers and corporates cut discretionary spending and capital investments. This is likely to cause markets to draw down early next year, before rallying later in the year once central banks pivot to finish the year moderately higher (\~5%).*  
&gt;  
&gt;***S&amp;P 500 OTM Puts***  
&gt;  
&gt;*""S&amp;P 500 Skew has come down sharply this year as low positioning reduced the demand for downside hedges and higher rates/volatility lowered the supply of call overwrites (See the Volatility Supply/Demand Section). Meanwhile, sharply higher short-term rates this year have shifted forwards higher, cheapening the cost of OTM Puts (as options are priced relative to the forward, not the spot level). Thus, despite the high macro risks, pricing of OTM Vanilla Puts is relatively inexpensive thanks to these technical factors - for example, the premium to buy a 3M 95% Put on the S&amp;P 500 is in just its 30th percentile relative to the last 3 years of history. Investors should therefore look to put on hedges given the weak outlook for markets, while taking advantage of the historically flat skew and high forwards by buying OTM Puts, which price well in this environment. Investors can consider for example:*

I personally would put it in a high yield savings until he is ready to buy a house. (FHA loan 3% down?) in a little over a year or so.

I recommended him getting a duplex, living in one side for 2 years, then moving and renting out his unit and put a larger down payment on where he actually wants to stay. (I always wanted to get into real estate so I am more than willing to learn this along with him).

Is there any way to invest it safely instead of using a high yield savings account?

or any other ways he can responsibly manage this amount at his age?

739,StockMarket,"Last month I discovered this company Green Giant Inc. (GGE). It is a small-cap player with Chinese background in the alternative energy industry. What caught my attention was its main business model ‚Äì of course, as I believe that climate and energy are the most significant investing theme for at least the next ten years. This company has recently appointed a new CEO and illustrated their business model for the alternative energy ambition for the first time. And I must admit it is exciting. According to the CEO, their ambitious plan is cooperating with American companies by providing experts (technical engineers) to ‚Äúdecarbonize‚Äù them, as well as investing in promising companies in this field.

Investing in a Chinese company that mostly operate in China could be scary, but I would argue that investing in a Chinese company that mainly operating abroad, investing in the US, and with an experienced American management team may be not. On the contrary, it might provide an excellent opportunity to capitalize the easing of the Covid restrictions and economic reopening of China. The China-US relationship is not at its best time, especially in tech and geopolitics where the competition is expected to continue. However, the cooperating in fighting climate change is not expected to end, as both countries have¬†made some very solid commitments at various global climate conferences recently.

It is generally difficult to predict with certainty when a stock's price will go up or down. Stock prices are influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic conditions, company performance, and market trends, and it is often difficult to predict how these factors will impact a particular stock's price.

That being said, there are some signs that may indicate that a stock's price is likely to increase in the future:

1. Positive earnings reports: If a company releases strong earnings reports, with revenues and profits exceeding expectations, this may signal that the company is performing well and that its stock price may rise.
2. Improving industry conditions: If the industry in which a company operates is experiencing growth or positive trends, this may indicate that the company's stock price may also increase.
3. Increasing demand for the company's products or services: If a company's products or services are in high demand, this may signal that the company is performing well and that its stock price may rise.
4. Positive news or developments: If a company announces positive news or developments, such as new partnerships or product launches, this may also indicate that its stock price may increase.

It is important to note that these are just a few potential indicators and that there are no guarantees when it comes to the stock market. It is always important to do your own research and carefully consider the risks before investing in any particular stock.",I asked Chat GPT when will stocks price go up,1671837117

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 26th, 2022.

# **S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq close higher Friday, but fall for a third straight week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose Friday, but still posted a weekly loss as recession fears continue to batter investor sentiment.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6% to 3,844.82, while the and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% to close at 10,497.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 176.44 points higher, or 0.5%, to 33,203.93.
*****
&gt; The major indexes oscillated earlier in the session after the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred gauge of inflation, came in slightly hotter than economists expected on a year-over-year basis, indicating that inflation is sticking despite the Fed‚Äôs efforts to fight it.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe economic numbers announced today highlight the difficulty for investors today, where weak numbers bring recession fears and strong numbers bring Fed fear,‚Äù said Louis Navellier, founder and chief investment officer of growth investing firm Navellier &amp; Associates.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúYou just can‚Äôt win right now on macro numbers,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThat is why it‚Äôs now much more of a stock-picking market, but with all the index and ETF traders even stocks that are executing their business plan well can get pushed around meaningfully by associated losers.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week down about 0.2% for the week, posting its third straight weekly decline. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, lost 2% for the week, also for the third down week in a row. The Dow was the outperformer, posting a 0.9% gain.
*****
&gt; Recession fears have resurged recently dashing some investors‚Äô hope for a year-end rally and leading to big losses in December. Investors worry that overtightening from central banks worldwide could force the economy into a downturn.
*****
&gt; For December, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 5.8%, while the Dow and Nasdaq have lost more than 4% and 8.5%, respectively. Those are the biggest monthly declines for the major averages since September. Stocks are also on pace for their worst annual performance since 2008.

&gt; # What You Need to Know About the Bank of Japan‚Äôs (Unexpected) Monetary Policy Change

&gt; The Bank of Japan (BOJ) made a surprise decision on Tuesday to widen the allowed trading band for 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) from ~25 to ~50 basis points. This move signals a shift in the BOJ‚Äôs approach to monetary policy and inflation and is likely to be sustained by the incoming governor of the BOJ.

&gt; For context, Japan has implemented a dovish monetary policy stance for years, with the BOJ‚Äôs rates remaining at 0% and large-scale quantitative easing being standard practice. The central bank has targeted a range around zero for the benchmark government bond yield since 2016 and has used this as a tool to keep overall market interest rates low. The policy change could alter the flow of capital from Japan, a major exporter of capital.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/JGB-vs-UST.png))**

&gt; The decision to widen the trading band caused the yen to spike and bond yields to rise. This caught investors off guard, who had expected the BOJ to wait to make changes to its yield curve control until Governor Haruhiko Kuroda steps down in April. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield has spiked to 0.47%, close to the BOJ‚Äôs newly set implicit cap.

&gt; # The Largest Buyers of U.S. Treasuries, But for How Long?
&gt; Japanese investors have historically sought investment opportunities outside of Japan, and as of October 2022, they were the largest holders of US Treasuries. The BOJ‚Äôs decision can significantly alter this flow of capital, causing Japanese investors to reconsider purchasing US Treasuries. The market is currently pricing in higher Japanese yields and a stronger yen. The rise in Japanese government bond (JGB) yield provides an increased incentive for Japanese investors to keep cash at home amid the global economic slowdown. This has the potential to negatively affect foreign risk assets, as well as strengthen the Yen versus the US Dollar.

&gt; # A Preview of Things to Come?
&gt; The Bank of Japan‚Äôs (BOJ) low-interest rate policy and its consistent purchase of bonds to maintain its yield cap have been criticized for distorting the yield curve, reducing market liquidity, and contributing to the yen‚Äôs depreciation, which has increased the cost of importing raw materials. The main question is whether this is a one-time adjustment or if we are getting a preview of what Japan‚Äôs new monetary policy approach will be moving forward.

&gt; This unexpected move by the Bank of Japan has the potential to be a headwind to the US Dollar as the Japanese Yen strengthens. We‚Äôll continue to monitor the implications of the hawkish move by the Bank of Japan and be sure to keep you updated along the way.

&gt; # Russell 1,000 Stocks Down the Most from All-Time Highs

&gt; As we wrap up an awful year for the stock market, below we highlight a list of the current Russell 1,000 stocks that are the farthest below their all-time highs. For the index as a whole, the average stock is down 15.85% YTD on a total return basis, while the average stock's price is about 38% below its all-time high.

&gt; About 30% of stocks in the Russell 1,000 are currently at least 50% below their all-time highs, while about 10% of index members are at least 75% below all-time highs. Below we list the 38 stocks that are all down at least 85% from their all-time highs and it includes Palantir's (PLTR) 85.96% drop to Plug Power's (PLUG) near evaporation of 99.2%. Most of these names have come down from all-time highs that were made at some point in 2021, although some like PLUG, AIG, and Citi (C) made highs a long time ago.

&gt; This list is a who's who of stocks that got caught up in the post-COVID retail investor buying spree. A name like Carvana (CVNA) hit its all-time high of $376.69 relatively recently in August of last year. It's at $4.13/share as of this morning. Upstart (UPST) traded above $400/share last October, and it's at $13 and change now. Roku (ROKU) got up to $490.40 last summer and is at $42 now or more than a full decimal point to the left!

&gt; # The Best and Worst Performing Stocks of 2022 (through 12/22)

&gt; Below are lists of the best and worst performing Russell 1,000 stocks year-to-date on a total return basis. We'll start with the worst first. Five stocks in the index are down more than 90% this year: Carvana (CVNA), Opendoor (OPEN), Novavax (NVAX), Upstart (UPST), and Affirm (AFRM). Another eleven are down more than 80%, which includes names like Coinbase (COIN), Twilio (TWLO), Wayfair (W), Lucid (LCID), and Roku (ROKU).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/riydownytd.png))**

&gt; Seventy-two percent of stocks in the Russell 1,000 are down YTD, but below are the names that have bucked the trend and gained the most. Just three stocks are up more than 100% YTD: Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Signify Health (SGFY), and Texas Pacific (TPL). Of the 38 names shown, 23 are from the Energy sector, with big names like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and ConocoPhillips (COP) included. Exxon's 78.8% YTD gain is easily its biggest annual move higher since at least 1980. Merck (MRK) is the biggest of the non-Energy stocks that made the list with a YTD gain of 49.8%.

&gt; # Day After Christmas NASDAQ &amp; Russell 2000 Up 73.5% Of Time

&gt; Santa Claus Rally starts today. The Santa Claus Rally was discovered and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 and published in our 1973 Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanacas the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year. This short, sweet rally is usually good for about 1.3% on the S&amp;P 500, but the real significance of the SCR is as an indicator.

&gt; It is our first seasonal indicator of the year ahead. Years when there was no Santa Claus Rally tended to precede bear markets or times when stocks hit significantly lower prices later in the year. As Yale‚Äôs famous line states (2023 Almanac page 118): ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù

&gt; NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have logged the greatest frequency and magnitude of gains on the day after Christmas. Since 1988, NASDAQ has advanced 73.5% of the time with an average move of +0.42%. R2K has also advanced 73.5% of the time with an average advance of +0.40%. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have slightly softer records, but bullish, nonetheless.

&gt; Two days after Christmas, the market is less bullish with NASDAQ down more often than up. Three days after Christmas R2K small caps take the lead advancing 64.7% of the time with an average gain of +0.46%.

&gt; Looking further out, from 1950-1985 last 5 trading days of the year S&amp;P 500 up 34 of 36 years, average gain 1.24%. 1986-2021 up 19 of 36, average gain 0.43%.

&gt; ‚ÄúIf Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù
‚ÄîYale Hirsh

&gt; One of the little-known facts about the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) is that it isn‚Äôt the entire month of December but is actually only seven days. Discovered in 1972 by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac (carried on now by his son Jeff Hirsch), the real SCR is the final five trading days of the year and first two trading days of the following year, not just December. In other words, the official SCR is set to begin tomorrow, Friday, December 23, 2022.

&gt; Historically, it turns out these seven days indeed have been quite jolly, as no seven-day combo is more likely to be higher (up 79.2% of the time), and only two combos have a better average return for the S&amp;P 500 than the 1.33% average return during the official Santa Claus Rally period.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-188.png))**

&gt; Here‚Äôs a chart we shared recently showing that it is the latter half of December when most of the seasonally strong gains occur.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-255.png))**

&gt; These seven days tend to be in the green, so that is expected. But fun trivia stat, the SCR has been higher the past six years and hasn‚Äôt been higher seven years in a row since the ‚Äò70s. The all-time record was an incredible 10-year winning streak in the ‚Äò50s and ‚Äò60s. Here we show all the SCR periods since the tech bubble and how the S&amp;P 500 does after each.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-356.png))**

&gt; The bottom line is that what really matters to investors is when Santa doesn‚Äôt come, as Mr. Hirsch noted in the quote at the start of this blog.

&gt; Here we show some recent times investors were given coal during these seven days, and the results after aren‚Äôt very good at all. The past five times that the SCR was negative saw January down as well. Then consider when there was no SCR in 2000 and 2008, not the best times for investors, and potentially some major warnings that something wasn‚Äôt right. Lastly, the full year was negative in 1994 and 2015 after no Santa. We like to say in the Carson Investment Research team that hope isn‚Äôt a strategy, but I‚Äôm hoping for some green during the SCR!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-46.png))**

&gt; Finally, the average gains each year for the S&amp;P 500 is 9.3% and is higher 71.8% of the time. But when there is a SCR, those numbers jump to 10.5% and 73.2%, falling to only 5.0% and 66.7% when there is no Santa. Sure, this is only one indicator, and we suggest following many more indicators to base your investment decisions, but this is clearly something we wouldn‚Äôt ignore either.

&gt; # Don‚Äôt Lose Faith Yet

&gt; Stocks have sold off hard after the Fed took a more hawkish-than-expected tone last week, which now has stocks looking at one of their worst December returns ever. The good news is that there is still time, and one of the most bullish times of the year is right around the corner.

&gt; We will discuss in more detail the Santa Claus rally tomorrow, as it officially starts on Friday. But today, I‚Äôll do a quick blog with a table that is always very popular.

&gt; As you can see, this table breaks down how each day of the year does. In my opinion, we are amid some of the strongest days of the year, from late December to early January. With stocks quite oversold and sentiment extremely negative, we expect a rally quite soon.

&gt; # No Worse Year for Sentiment

&gt; The past few weeks had been uneventful when it comes to the AAII's weekly reading on investor sentiment. As we noted last week, the three-week range that bullish sentiment occupied had reached a record low hovering between 24.3% and 24.7%. In the latest release, sentiment finally moved but not in the most promising direction. Bullish sentiment dropped 4 percentage points down to 20.3% this week to make for the lowest reading since the end of September.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; With a decline in neutral sentiment as well, all of the increase went to bears with that reading rising to the highest level and back above 50% for the first time since late October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; As a result of the large inverse moves of the two sentiment readings, the bull-bear spread shows a dramatic tilt towards an even more pessimistic bias with bears outnumbering bulls by 32 percentage points. That is the widest spread since the week of October 20th and lower than most of the past decade's range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; With yet another week of bears outnumbering bulls, the record streak of negative readings in the bull-bear spread has grown to 38 weeks long; a full month longer than the previous record ending in October 2020. Historically, investor sentiment has acted as a contrarian indicator meaning low readings on optimism have typically been followed by stronger returns for the S&amp;P 500. This time around, sentiment and prices have given each other little reason to turn around.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-5.png))**

&gt; In an earlier post, we noted how there has not even been a single week this year in which bullish sentiment has been above the historical average of 37.6%. Taking another look at just how depressed sentiment has been, the average bullish sentiment reading in 2022 has been less than 25%. The only years that had come close to such a low reading were 1988 (27.29%) and 1990 (27.08%). Playing into that low average has been the fact that there have been a record 30 weeks this year with bullish sentiment coming in below 25%. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment has averaged 46.17% this year, slightly above the previous record of 45.2% in 2008. With bearish sentiment tipping back above 50% once again this week, there have now been 17 weeks with such an elevated reading, tying the record from 2008 with one week to go.

&gt; # Malaise Among Individual Investors

&gt; The misery of 2022 has continued when it comes to investor sentiment. In the latest weekly AAII poll, bullish sentiment declined from 24.3% down to 20.3%. That's the lowest reading since the end of September and less than five points above the YTD low of 15.8% from mid-April.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-aaii.png))**

&gt; As shown in the chart above, there hasn't been a single week this year where bullish sentiment has been above its historical average of 37.6%, and the only week where sentiment was even close to its historical average was at the start of the year. With just one week left in the year, barring a historic one-week surge, 2022 will go down as the first year in the history of the AAII survey where there wasn't a single week that bullish sentiment was above average. Talk about malaise.

&gt; # Mega-Caps Down $5 Trillion in Market Cap, AMZN Now Down $1+ Trillion

&gt; As we approach the end of 2022, below is an updated look at the drawdown in market cap that we've seen in the US equity space since major indices peaked on the first trading day of the year. Using the Russell 3,000 as a proxy, the US stock market has seen an $11.7 trillion drawdown from the peak on 1/3/22. The max drawdown was $13.6 trillion at the low on 9/30, so we've seen market cap increase by just under $2 trillion since then. In dollar terms, this drawdown has been more extreme than anything investors have ever experienced. That's pretty deflationary if you ask us!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/drawdownray.png))**

&gt; Of the $11.7 trillion drawdown in US equity market cap, just over $5 trillion of the drop has come from six companies! Below is a look at the six current and former ""trillion dollar market cap"" club members that have now collectively lost about $5.07 trillion in market cap from their peaks. As shown, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) have all lost at least $750 billion in market cap from their highs. And Amazon (AMZN) is the first to lose more than $1 trillion in market cap! Just a few years ago, no company had a market cap of more than a trillion dollars, and now we have a company that has lost more than a trillion dollars in market cap.

&gt; For all six of these companies, their current drawdowns are easily their biggest on record. Apple (AAPL) has lost $880 billion, Alphabet (GOOGL) is down $846 billion, Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA) are both down more than $760 billion, and Microsoft (MSFT) is down $784 billion even though it was down close to a trillion at its lows in November.

784,StockMarket,,Our boy Sam back online and ready for playing league again,1671833478
785,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**:  Price ""floated"" on very low volume (50% of average) and remained entirely within yesterday's candle.  With the sideays chop seen this week, an argument could be made that we are 5 or 6 days into a bear flag forming off the latest down move from December 12 - 16.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**: Nearest resistance at 386.58, then 389.63 gap fill with major resistance at 394.30 / 399.40 gap window/fill.  Nearest support at 380.54 to 378.28 -- major support at 365

&amp;#x200B;

**QQQ:** Price again recovered off support at 263.32 -- major resistance remains at 280.72 -- where bullish consolidation broke down. Major support is between 260.85 to 261.21 the COVID-low TL. 

&amp;#x200B;

**IWM:** Most ""bullish"" price action today of any major, but definitely relative.  Nearest resistance is 175.68 -- then major at 180.19 gap-fill. Nearest support is that same 171.18 pivot low, with 167.78 to 167.55 being a major level.

&amp;#x200B;

**Charts posted yesterday (December 22) remain fully intact -- so no sense re-posting them today.**

Exit:  4.61   
Avg:  2.26  
Remaining:  0.5%  
Entry Date: 9/1/2022

Epic run by the Chinese stocks since late-October.  I kept a small 0.5% position just in the event this continues to run; however, I expect a pullback to $3.25 and will add more there.

Price: 94.55  
Size: 0.5%  
Thesis:  50% retrace from its selloff on December 1st and 16x days into a bear-flag formation off that same selloff candle.  I took a 0.5% position because I could see price continue floating up next week given the holiday volume; if it does, I will add another 0.5% at 97.75 and then a full 1% at the $99 double top from April 21st.  First target to cover is $87, followed by the ascending TL between $78 - $80.

If price breaks down further, I will add another 1% at 2.15 -- gap fill from July 22/25, 2016 -- and then another 1% at 1.80 (pivot lows from ealry 2016).  First target is $3.34

858,StockMarket,"**Market Recap**

On Dec 22, the three major indexes all closed lower by more than 1%. At the close, the Dow dropped 1.04%, the Nasdaq dropped 2.18%, and the S&amp;P 500 was down 1.4%.

&amp;#x200B;

The lower tail for SPY is much long than the upper tail and this could be a bullish reversal signal for the market in the short-term. Yesterday‚Äôs low could be a short-term support in the future. Right now, the SMA20 &amp; SMA200 are both moving downward while the SMA50 is moving upward on the daily chart. It is interesting that yesterday high almost touched the lower band of equilibrium area with only 10 cents distance, and then the price fell and closed at $380.72. This kind of price action normally means that SPY is having trouble fighting against the short-term down-trend.

&amp;#x200B;

QQQ was down 2.45% and formed a hammer on the daily chart that is extended on the downside, though the lower tail needs to be longer for it to be a perfectly tradable hammer. Yesterday low could be important for the next couple days.

&amp;#x200B;

The 10-year US Treasury yield rose 0.491% to 3.682%, compared with a yield spread of -59 bps over the two-year note while VIX was up 9.47%. Brent crude closed down 0.4%. Spot gold closed down 1.21% at $1,792.63.03 an ounce. The dollar index was up 0.14%, closing at 104.39.

&amp;#x200B;

US Q3 final real GDP annualized came at 3.2% vs. 2.90% expected. Analysts said a breakdown of Q3 GDP data shows net exports contributed the most to growth, along with housing investment and inventory. U.S. initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled 216,000 for the week ended Dec. 17, versus 222,000 expected and 211,000 previously reported. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits was little changed and remained near historically low levels, underscoring companies' reluctance to lay off workers in a supply-constrained labor market, which economists said would be a red flag for the labor market.

859,StockMarket,"Today is the last trading day before Christmas, Core PCE Price Index will release at 8:30 EST which will have an important impact on the market.

What‚Äôs Core PCE Price Index?

Here is what I found: The Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index measures the changes in the price of goods and services purchased by consumers for the purpose of consumption, excluding food and energy. Prices are weighted according to total expenditure per item. 

Potatoes and bread can make me feel less hungry. When the price of bread goes up and the price of potatoes stays the same, with my salary remaining the same, I can only buy less bread. 

At this situation, potatoes are used instead of bread when calculating PCE. The Fed has a preference for PCE data as a broader and more robust measure of inflation.

Core PCE Price Index m/m\*: Forecast:0.2%, previous 0.2%. If result more than 0.2%, it means Inflation is not effectively controlled, the Fed may continue to raise interest rates, stock market will fall further.

861,StockMarket," 

With 12 years of Futures scalping then Forex chart trading using Price action, what I have realized to be successful are the following:

A- Forget everything you read in books about trading, forget chart patterns, and most importantly, forget trading indicators (I am not talking about trading using manual tools, just the automated indicators). All you have access to is meant to force you to trade just like everybody else, and therefore, it allows big players (banks and major institutions) to take action against your positions because you and the other retail traders bring liquidity to the market the big players seek to make money.

B - If I was to rank the most important aspect to retail traders, it would be

1/ Strategy (Build Scenario)

2 / Risk Management (Make Profits)

2/ Money Management (Protect your Capital)

4 / Mind Management (Psychology)

In reality, live traders out there would probably share the opposite view:

First, Psychology &gt;&gt;&gt; Second, Protect your Capital &gt;&gt;&gt; Third, Add to the Profits &gt;&gt;&gt; At last, Build a Scenario

Most traders out there will probably tell you ""work on your Number One aspect : Psychology! Work on your mindset"". The truth very few understands is: How?

The only way to build a strong conviction muscle is.....TO BE CONVINCED!

How? By having strong rules, rules you have put to the test and make them work. That's right, your least important aspect in trading, Strategy, is suddenly intertwined with the notion of Psychology. If you don't believe in your strategy, you will have a weak mindset, no matter how hard you can sustain getting hit by the market. Losing money is a psychological torture, if the idea of losing small is sustainable, try getting hit 20, 30 or 40 times in a row, your mind won't tolerate it eventually. Losing frequently can destroy any mind, just like torture in the army. So to prevent that, your number 1 aspect in trading is the tandem Strategy - Psychology (same level of importance).

Now regarding the last 2 aspect (Money &amp; Risk Management) what is best? To protect your losses, or to make good money. I have heard it all, even thought one was better than the other, then reverse my mind to think the opposite. To finally agree on one thing:

&lt;&gt;Losing small is good in the short run, but winning big is more important in the long run&lt;&gt;

Because we hate wasting time, you tend to fear missing out on the action. So we destroy the money management (loss of capital) by entering late, making the stop loss wider. And when things go wrong, we get hit hard. So Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is wrong. Keeping losses small should be the solution, right?

Well, not exactly. If you don't book profits and don't add to the profits, you don't build the cushion that allows you to lose small. Losing small is dangerous, because your stop loss is tight, you get to lose more frequently. Watching the trade ride is a waste of time, so it is better to capitalize on your time by adding to profits and book intermediate profits. In order to avoid the FOMO effect.

To conclude, Money &amp; Risk Management are equally important, it is a savant dosage to know how to operate the markets perfectly. With years of development and live trading experience, of draining accounts, of now consistently achieving a % with 4 digits per annum, I can assure you:

I would rank the most important aspect to trading as follows:

First, Psychology + Strategy

Second, Money + Risk Management

863,StockMarket,"Recently the pessimistic mood surrounded the market. The SPX went through a four consecutive loss and got two days off for a rebound, but yesterday it headed straight down and breached the 3800 level support. Although some buying powers engaged in the afternoons to bring the SPX back above 3800, it still closed way lower than yesterday.

Before yesterday, I was expecting for a price correction of SPX to 8&amp;21 EMAs. But now it looks like SPX is doing a time correction. Selling power is strong, I don‚Äôt see any point of a rally incoming, unless somewhat good news come out, that may light up some hopes for the buyer. 

The only good news I could think of might come from the economic indicators.

888,StockMarket,"I keep hearing that the consumer balance sheet is strong, with a various set of implications:  earnings stay strong, no recession, bullish on stocks, etc.  This is r/StockMarket, so generally what we want is an answer to the question:  ""How does it affect the stock market?""  Spoiler in the title, obviously, but here are some charts to consider.

&amp;#x200B;

Housekeeping notes: For ""the strength of the consumer balance sheet,"" I'm using Federal Reserve data that you can find [here.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/z1/balance_sheet/table/)  Specifically, the column of Total Liabilities as a % of Disposable Personal Income.  For S&amp;P 500 returns, I'm using quarterly close (to match the quarterly data from the Federal Reserve), from Q4 1969 to Q3 2022 (because that's as far back as my brokerage has .SPX data).  The .SPX returns are price-only (no dividends) and not inflation-adjusted.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to correlate the 3, 6, 12, and 24 month .SPX returns with liabilities as a percentage of DPI.  Here are the charts:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1: Quarterly household liabilities as a &amp;#37; of disposable personal income, Q4 1969 to Q3 2022.](https://preview.redd.it/szxwrg8nbk7a1.jpg?width=1254&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8524c36caeb8f9cf0d9af0c0a8062cc15f1ff261)

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 2: Correlation between 3-month .SPX return and household liabilities as a percentage of disposable personal income.](https://preview.redd.it/y22tqy70ck7a1.jpg?width=1258&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa9017053d31905bb6811646a8d3626edd163cde)

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 3: Correlation between 6-month .SPX return and household liabilities as a percentage of disposable personal income.](https://preview.redd.it/coshgjncck7a1.jpg?width=1254&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfd1fdb8ee8b3cf583b55d020c7836c80e47aa41)

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 4: Correlation between 1-year .SPX return and household liabilities as a percentage of disposable personal income.](https://preview.redd.it/w7m54u7nck7a1.jpg?width=1257&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0de848f38067e84d65e1568e58e4e92f5447db24)

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 5: Correlation between 2-year .SPX return and household liabilities as a percentage of disposable personal income.](https://preview.redd.it/n5jitkctck7a1.jpg?width=1263&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7872639d59233f13071a480286ceafaf94df0069)

&amp;#x200B;

Interpretation:  household debt isn't in a great place or a terrible place.  It's a little high historically, but it's fairly well off peak.  Fortunately, that doesn't matter for stock returns!  As you can see from figures 4-5, there is essentially zero correlation between the current level of household debt to disposable personal income over 3, 6, 12, and 24 month timeframes.  No trend at all.  Not even a weak correlation.  Every pattern on every timeframe is nearly perfectly random.

**QQQ:** Price recovered off support at 263.32 gap-fill -- must get above 373.96 to negate bear flag from forming. Major resistance will be at 280.72 -- where bullish consolidation broke down.  Major support is between 260.85 to 261.21 the COVID-low TL.

 Is there something I am missing here? Did I miss a news announcement? I was surprised this morning when opening Robinhood to see that the ""rally"" i thought was occurring yesterday did a complete 180.

However, in the third image someone much smarter than me correctly made a projection on the turnaround. Is there something to be learned from the ""triple rejection"" and ""gap"" in his strategy?

937,StockMarket,"Citadel expects to return about $7 billion in profits to its clients on the back of what is expected to be its most profitable year ever, said people familiar with the firm, highlighting the banner year some hedge funds have had even as others nurse deep wounds.

Citadel‚Äôs flagship fund gained about 32% for the year through November, benefiting from bets across the firm‚Äôs strategies, the people said. The firm plans to return some profits from all four of its funds in early January but still expects to start 2023 with more than $50 billion in assets under management, one of the people said.

Others up significantly this year, including Two Sigma, Brevan Howard Asset Management and D.E. Shaw, also have told clients in certain funds they plan to return some profits, people familiar with the firms said. Bloomberg News earlier reported D.E. Shaw was returning some profits to clients and raising fees.

The war in Ukraine and the parade of Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes have helped create what investors are calling a regime change in markets, benefiting trading-oriented hedge-fund strategies that thrive on volatility and punishing those that make leveraged bets on fast-growing companies.

While Tiger Global Management and other growth-focused hedge funds have issued mea culpas and had years of huge gains erased practically overnight, funds that bet on global macroeconomic shifts and those built on a multimanager-platform model, like Citadel, have flourished in one of the widest divergences industry veterans can recall.

The gains Citadel and the others have notched are all the more noteworthy in a year in which the S&amp;P 500 was down a total 18.5% through Tuesday and a traditional portfolio made up of 60% global stocks and 40% U.S. bonds, including dividends, has lost about 16%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Some managers are pressing their hot hand to win more advantageous terms from their clients. Macro firm Caxton Associates has told clients it is raising performance fees for some share classes of its Caxton Macro fund to as high as 30% on Jan. 1, according to people familiar with the matter. The fund gained more than 30% this year through mid-December. D.E. Shaw is raising performance fees on its three biggest funds to as high as 40%.

[https://capital10x.com/largo-2022-report/](https://capital10x.com/largo-2022-report/)

**Executive Summary**

The global energy order is going through a once in a century shift. Energy supply chains and the energy mix powering the globe are being completely remade by governments focused not on economic growth but on emissions.  These changes are creating investment opportunities that can last decades for the companies positioned to take advantage.

Largo Inc. (‚ÄúLargo‚Äù), a company unknown to many investors, sits at the epicenter of it all.  Capital 10x‚Äôs deep dive report on Largo will break down the global energy shifts taking place, the opportunities they will create and why Largo may quickly become one of the highest value ways to invest in these multi-decade growth trends.

&amp;#x200B;

Excerpts from the report below:

&amp;#x200B;

**The Energy Transition Will Make Big Winners Out of Certain Commodities: Vanadium Will Be One of Them.** 

Even though certain developed countries already generate up to half of their energy needs from renewables, the supply chains to fuel the creation of those same energy sources look the same as they did 50 or 100 years ago.

The materials that powered a world running on oil, gas and coal will not be the same ones powering our solar panels and wind turbines. The new world order requires two things above all, energy storage and energy efficiency. Vanadium, and by extension Largo is poised to enable both. 

**The Market Doesn‚Äôt Yet Appreciate Accelerating Vanadium Demand** 

[Vanadium Demand by Sector](https://preview.redd.it/x1088qvrkg7a1.png?width=240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba3d44253c7e4b3c18fab3072deac37e4a5ac62d)

Pricing for Vanadium is expected to remain strong into the future as supply has not been ramping up fast enough to meet increasing demand.

[Supply Shortages are followed by Strong Price Increases](https://preview.redd.it/w8539npmlg7a1.png?width=470&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8b00e53dafc9d57f6040b5e1daf558b819604c6)

As the word‚Äôs only pure play vanadium miner, Largo offers investors a differentiated way to invest in the developing movement towards lessening global carbon emissions.  Largo sells both standard grade and high purity vanadium pentoxide products around the world.

Standard grade VPURE‚Ñ¢ vanadium pentoxide flakes which can be converted into ferrovanadium for the steel industry.  VPURE+‚Ñ¢ vanadium pentoxide flakes and powder used in the production of master alloys for aerospace applications and chemical/catalyst applications VPURE+‚Ñ¢ vanadium trioxide powder for aerospace and chemical/catalyst applications. 

Vanadium Redox Flow Battery VCHARGE with patented technology and substantial IP portfolio Ideally suited for long duration energy storage applications over 6 hours.  The company recently launched Largo Physical Vanadium (TSX.V:VAND) which acts as an independent financial intermediary and will own the vanadium needed in Largo‚Äôs VRFBs ‚Äì essentially eliminating the cost of vanadium in VRFBs (represents a 40-50% cost reduction).

The company recently expanded into the pigments business and will use existing feedstock from its vanadium operations to enhance margins. The company expects to begin producing ilmenite concentrate in Q3 2023 and expects to begin full production of titanium dioxide beginning in 2025. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Largo is a two pillar business model](https://preview.redd.it/yx4i2ebpog7a1.png?width=497&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00a756d0d235af434b781f1d9801d3f4ba55febe)

**When it Comes to Mining Vanadium, Largo is the 800 Pound Gorilla**

Largo‚Äôs production capacity is \~11,000 - 13,000 tonnes of V2O5 annually, a full 50% of all primary

vanadium mine capacity globally.

 **Largo‚Äôs Two Pillar Business Model**  

Pillar 1 Vanadium for Energy Efficient Manufacturing 

 Vanadium‚Äôs ability to make steel and other materials both lighter and stronger has always made it a key component in the global construction industry. However, with the signing of the Paris Agreement to decrease CO2  emissions, government pressure increased on all industries to step up to the challenge. It‚Äôs hard to overstate how important the construction industry is to global emissions.  

 About 22.5% of global steel production is used in reinforcement bars (rebar) for the construction industry with the UN estimating the energy consumption of buildings account for 30% to 40% of all global energy demand.  

https://preview.redd.it/kt5s30b1rg7a1.png?width=300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59140eed308dfdf7711c27c46cafc9a1a01fc6c2

 Building Codes Could Drive a 7x Increase in Vanadium Demand 

 China is waking up to the benefits of vanadium reinforced steel and demand intensity for both China and other emerging markets will converge with the higher usage of developed markets over time. North American steel has twice the vanadium content of Chinese steel. China, a major source of demand for vanadium, recently toughened steel rebar quality standards increasing the minimum vanadium content requirement to .03-.10%. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Pillar 2 Vanadium for Battery Storage 

 As global experts in the chemical properties of vanadium, Largo has quickly identified promising future uses of Vanadium beyond construction. The most promising near term revenue opportunity for Largo is the Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRFB). A VRFB is a type of flow battery based on technology with decades of research, testing and development behind it.

 **Largo is Creating Entirely New Demand Markets with the Launch of Largo Physical Vanadium Corp. (LPV)** 

What we like most about the management team at Largo is that they are not content to hope demand and pricing play out like the forecasts. They are aggressively building new sources of demand and new ways for investors to gain exposure to vanadium.

**Enter Largo Physical Vanadium Corp. (LPV).**

Largo Physical Vanadium (TSX.V:VAND) is a publicly traded holding company that exclusively buys and holds physical vanadium.  For the first time, through LPV, an investor can gain direct exposure to vanadium. LPV works very similarly to the wildly popular Sprott Physical Uranium Trust but with a few twists.

LPV is a genius move by the Largo team as it increases demand for vanadium, drives adoption of VRFB

batteries and raises public awareness of the significant environmental benefits of the metal.

The establishment of LPV benefits Largo in a few ways:

1. Reduces cost of VRFBs for Largo‚Äôs potential VRFB customers by removing the cost of vanadium from

the system as LPV is only charging a token fee for use of the vanadium in the battery electrolyte which

offsets management fees for LPV

2. Increase in demand for vanadium should benefit Largo‚Äôs top line in the future.

3. Continues Largo‚Äôs focus on ESG-aligned strategies while using vanadium in batteries 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ogqu7bk4tg7a1.png?width=563&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f19c4c7a16b746cd0dcc6d0810dd49c88ade9d4c

LPV started trading on the TSX-V exchange September 30th under the ticker VAND.V and currently holds 690,000 kilograms of vanadium. 

 **Largo Offers Production Growth and 20 Years of Reserves** 

Not only does Largo produce 7% of the world‚Äôs vanadium supply, it also has room to grow production capacity and sustain it for decades. 

High prices and free cashflow are nothing if the resource under the ground won‚Äôt sustain it.  If the world‚Äôs need for vanadium grows as strongly as forecasts expect over the next decade, investors and customers will be scrambling to lock down high quality and long lasting supplies of vanadium.

Largo is the only pure play vanadium miner with high purity capacity available today, the ability to increase production to meet surging demand and the resources to supply production for decades to come.

 **Largo Trades at a Large Discount to the Value of the Mining Assets with the Other Businesses Essentially for Free** 

 The management team at Largo is expecting strong year after year growth in LOM cashflow as Vanadium‚Äôs role grows more important to companies meeting global emissions targets. In 2021, consultancy GE21 ran an economic analysis showing Largo is expected to produce $4.0 billion of free cash flow over the life of mine at an approximate vanadium price of $8.50/lb. This exceeds Largo‚Äôs entire current market cap of \~C$489 million by 10x. 

GE21 also found that Largo‚Äôs vanadium mine alone has a C$2 billion after tax net present value, 4x higher than the companies current trading value. Not to mention the NPV analysis excludes Largo‚Äôs energy business which has significant potential on its own. According to RBC Capital Markets estimates, Largo‚Äôs cleantech business could be worth $190 million meaning investors are buying the vanadium mining business for only $300 million, or 1.7x 2023 EBITDA estimates.

*****
&gt; Stock futures were muted in early trading on Thursday, as traders digested a sharp rally from the previous session.
*****
&gt; Stock futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Averages fell 79 points or 0.23%. S&amp;P 500 futures declined 0.25%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.34% lower.
*****
&gt; CarMax shares dropped more than 12% in the premarket after the used car retailer missed profit and revenue expectations. Micron Technology shares slipped 3% in the premarket on disappointing quarterly results. Under Armour shares shifted between gains and losses after the athletics apparel maker selected Marriott executive Stephanie Linnartz as its next CEO.
*****
&gt; The moves followed another positive session for stocks. On Wednesday, the Dow gained 526.74 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite surged 1.49% and 1.54%, respectively.
*****
&gt; All 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished the day with gains, led to the upside by energy. Nike and FedEx shares rose on quarterly results, giving some investors hope that earnings are faring decently despite concerns of a downturn. Strong consumer sentiment data for December also gave markets a lift.
*****
&gt; While better earnings results likely factored into the upbeat market sentiment Wednesday, oversold conditions may have contributed to the rally, according to Liz Ann Sonders, Charles Schwab‚Äôs chief investment strategist.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think there were a couple of earnings reports that came out that were marginally better than expected,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut I also think that the market has been in another corrective phase, and, on some technical measures, got a bit oversold. Buyers stepped in. The wiggles on a day-to-day basis are hard to put a direct finger on.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Even with Wednesday‚Äôs gains, stocks are on pace to finish the month with losses. The Dow is down 3.51%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have tumbled 4.94% and 6.62%, respectively. All three major averages are slated to break a 3-year win streak and post their worst yearly performance since 2008.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, investors awaited jobless claims data.

Plan: Long around $140.5, stop loss at $138.3, target to $146, risk-reward ratio is 1:2.

From the SPX 15 minutes chart, support level is around 3860, resistance level is around 3910. I think it will be a sideways trend today, and it‚Äôs hard to trade.

The price is extended from 8&amp;21 EMAs, I am expecting a price correction.

On the 15 mins chart, resistance is found around 13.04. This resistance is definitely not as strong as the trend line resistance, but underneath the line there is a small gap between 12.79 and 13.02, and that will possibly hinder the rebound.

Looking through charts, seems like a rebound on going.

 Ronny Yakov, CEO of OLB, said, ""As we previously announced, our Board of Directors has authorized a stock buyback to buy our common stock from time to time as market conditions warrant to reduce our shares outstanding at historically low valuations. Considering OLB's current market cap is only about $13 million with our Year over Year revenue growth approaching 100% to a revenue projection of over $31 million for 2022, Patrick and I have decided to purchase shares personally when permitted as we believe the trading price does not reflect the value of the shares.""

\-Eyes and thoughts are on finding the first rate cut.  This will be a leading indicator of direction and pivot once found.

Lastly Historically speaking, Santa rally happens last 5 trading days of the yr and has happened for last 72yrs.  Though there has not been a time to where we were in a decline like we are with the market as of now.  It is still possible but be cautious. (Chart)

&amp;#x200B;

\*On a positive note though, sediment throughout the market is the Santa Clause Rally is it hasn't even begun.  If that is the case, strap in your moon boots boys and girls cuz were going for a ride.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Or not but it would be the first non rally yr in 72 yrs.

&amp;#x200B;

**SPY**: Price pierced into the gap-window, then stalled, and failed to close above Friday's red canble at 386.58 -- if price does not get above this leave, a bear flag may be forming. Next resistance 389.63 gap fill -- with 394.30 and 399.40 gap window/fill as significant resistance. If bears return, 380.54 to 378.28 is immediate support, with more solid support at 374.13 gap-fill and a decade-old TL around 365.

**QQQ:** Price bounced right to its former support TL, then stalled, and failed to close above Monday's red candle at 373.96 -- if price does not get above this level, a bear flag may be forming. If price can ge above that TL it should hit moderate resistance at 280.72 where its previous bullish consolidation broke down -- then 282.25 to 286.51 are gap window/fill.  If bears return, 268.49 to 266.95 is immediate support, with more solid support at 263.32 gap-fill, then it will hit major support between 260.85 to 261.21 the COVID-low TL.

**IWM:** Price pierced the 175.68 gap-fill, pulled back, but did manage to close above Monday's red canble at 175.05 -- the most 'bullish' action of the majors, and as a leaing indicator, suggests there may be more upside in the market.  Next resistance is 178.03 gap-window, with more moderate resistance at 180.19 gap-fill; major resistance remains between 186.40 to 185.95 with converging TLs. If bears return, weak support begins at 174.45 gap-window, with 172.92 offering slightly more support.  More moderate support at 171.18 pivot low, with 167.78 to 167.55 being a major level.

I executed 2x trades today

Trade:  OPEN  
Type:  LONG  
Stock:  TSLA  
Price:  136.00  
Size:  0.5%  
Thesis:  Filled a major gap from November 2020.  I only took a 0.5% position because of how volatile TSLA has been given all that is going on between Elon &amp; TWTR; I will add another 0.5% at 132, the pivot low immediately prior to the aforementioned gap-up.  My first target is $165

Trade:  OPEN  
Type:  SHORT  
Stock:  ACGL  
Price:  63.10  
Size:  0.5%  
Thesis:  Pierce of a major resistance trend line.  I only took a 0.5% position because today is Day #2 of the current move and at least one more up-day is highly likely, especially if the broader markets continue to bounce.  I will add another 0.5% if price hits 65.00 tomorrow, followed by another 1% if price moves directly to $68.  My first target for covering is the $55 gap window.

I'm trying to figure out what the best market to trade the s&amp;p is, to grow a small account, that would allow me to risk as little as possible for the same gain and still make a usable amount of money to compound the account. I was trying to decide between forex (SPX500), futures (MES), or equities (SPY or a cheaper etf). For this example say it's a \~1-2k account.

1. Assuming I was consistent with a chosen strategy, does one market over the other allow you to risk less for the same gain, and have better profit potential with? (easier/faster to scale a small account with). If so, what is the reason? ex. leverage?, just how the buying/selling is designed?

2. Which of the two would be easier to learn between forex and futures? (I'm already familiar with equities)

3. Would the gains even be worth it to trade equities (or fractional shares) for SPY (or a \~$40 priced spy etf) with a 1-2k account?

**SAN DIEGO, Dec. 21, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --** **KULR Technology Group, Inc.** **(NYSE American: KULR) (the ""Company"" or ""KULR""), a leading energy management platform company accelerating the global transition to a sustainable electrification economy, today announced that it has entered into a six-figure annual subscription agreement with an industry leading, American-based commercial helicopter operator (the ‚ÄúClient‚Äù) to provide global track and balance support for its fleet of helicopters via** **KULR VIBE****, which provides a proprietary AI-driven vibration reduction solution. By incorporating KULR VIBE into their maintenance program, the Client can safely service and maintain operations of its diverse helicopter fleet which service customers in the oil and gas and air-medical sectors.**  


**The Client is one of the world's largest civilian helicopter operators with over 250 diverse aircraft spanning 5 continents.**

**Through KULR VIBE, the Company addresses one of the most challenging issues with advanced machinery today, excessive vibrations. Vibrations cause increased maintenance, accelerated component replacements, and downtime. Excessive energy-robbing vibrations are destructive to both the helicopter and in many cases the operator. By integrating KULR VIBE into its existing hardware and software processes, the Client can pinpoint areas where excess vibrations across its fleet of 250+ helicopters may cause system malfunctions, weakened performance, maintenance issues, and loss of available aircraft to perform its mission. With KULR VIBE and the 24/7/365 maintenance support it provides, the Client can keep its fleet of helicopters, that would otherwise be grounded or pose a substantial risk to crew members airborne. KULR‚Äôs Mechanical Fault Diagnostic (""MFD"") software compliments the learning algorithms and AI functions of KULR VIBE to provide a comprehensive solution for the end customer.**

**‚ÄúKULR has a long history of developing products that offer its customers proven solutions built to safely withstand the most severe conditions, from space to extreme heat, while also mitigating the potentially devastating effects of excessive vibration on machinery,‚Äù said KULR‚Äôs President &amp; COO, Keith Cochran. ‚ÄúThrough our KULR VIBE solution we enable this Client to provide high-quality support to their customers and ensure they can safely carry out some of the most challenging assignments in aviation.‚Äù**

**This recent contract comes on the heels of KULR VIBE's platform** **identifying and remedying** **vibration problems on two Bell AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters and one Bell Boeing Osprey V-22 tiltrotor aircraft at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in southern California. The almost $40 million AH-1Z Viper Attack Helicopter was previously diagnosed as inoperable before KULR's team quickly identified, resolved, and facilitated a return of the aircraft to mission capable status.**

**KULR is currently working with a helicopter retrofit company to embed its systems in older aircraft while focusing on a key market of original equipment manufacturers who may wish to install KULR VIBE as factory equipment. The Company‚Äôs immediate focus is two-fold: grow the commercial helicopter business and integrate with the United States Department of Defense to help enable their fleet for flight readiness 24/7/365.**  
**In addition to helicopters, the Company sees applications for KULR VIBE in eVTOL aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems, high-performance automobiles, renewable wind energy turbines and industrial motors.**

**According to Fact.MR, an insights-driven global market intelligence company, the global vibration motor market** **is estimated** **at USD 6.5 Billion in 2022 and is forecast to reach USD 24.1 Billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 14.1% during 2022-2032.**",NYSE: KULR Provides Client‚Äôs Global Fleet of Helicopters with Mission-Critical Maintenance Support,1671638718

# [Dow futures jump more than 300 points, boosted by Nike shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose on Wednesday after earnings reports from two major bellwethers raised hopes that corporate earnings may be better than feared even with a possible recession on the horizon.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 340 points, or 1%. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.6%.
*****
&gt; Nike shares added 12% after the apparel maker beat Wall Street‚Äôs expectations for quarterly earnings and revenue. FedEx gained 4.7% even as it fell short of revenue expectations. The package delivery giant beat consensus earnings per share estimates on per-share.
*****
&gt; With the end of 2022 in close sight, all three major averages are on pace to post their worst yearly performance since 2008 and break a 3-year win streak. As of Tuesday‚Äôs close, the Dow was down 9.6%. For the month, it‚Äôs toppled about 5%. The S&amp;P is down 19.82% for the year and more than 6% for December, while the Nasdaq‚Äôs plummeted 32.58% in 2022 and about 8% this month.
*****
&gt; Wednesday‚Äôs moves followed a day of slight gains for stocks. The major indexes snapped a four-day losing streak, putting a little wind back into hopes for an end-of-year rally.
*****
&gt; The modest gains came even after the Bank of Japan moved to widen its cap on the 10-year Japanese government bond yield, leading to a spike in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield higher that initially rattled traders.
*****
&gt; There are a few more big names left to report earnings before the Christmas holiday, with Micron reporting after the bell.

**This isn't financial advice. Never rush into investments. Always take your time to do your own DD before investing.** 

The last couple of days we got confirmation. Several uranium transactions were made above an uranium price of 60 USD/lb, even Encore Energy announced a small uranium transaction at 70.50 USD/lb yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

**EnCore Energy:**

Indeed, based on the global uranium production cost curve analysis vs the global uranium demand, uranium transactions around 80 USD/lb will eventually occure in the near future. It's just a matter of time.

Today physical uranium can be bought through Sprott Physical Uranium Trust at an uranium price of only \~42.50 USD/lb (= U.UN share price 14.60 CAD/share), while transactions are occurring now above 60USD/lb and even already 70USD/lb

Plan: Long around $128.5, stop loss at $127, target to $133, risk-reward ratio is 1:3.

Buy at $127.5, stop loss at $127, 1 to 1 kick at $128.2. Sell some position at $129.2, and then hold before market close.

It‚Äôs a good choice when open at $127.5, risk is $0.5, but you can reward $2.5.

Plan: Long around $145, stop loss at $143.5, target to $148, risk-reward ratio is 1:2.

Buy at $145, stop loss at $143.5, 1 to 1 kick price is around $146.8, but failed, hold my positions before market close.

In yesterday‚Äôs two trade, open at a cheaper price so that I can buy more, and hold to get profits.

In a Bloomberg monthly survey of 38 economists, the probability of a recession in 2023 is estimated to be 70%. The median estimate of GDP growth is about 0.3% next year. Economists also estimate an annualized 0.7% DECLINE in the second quarter and flat readings in first and third quarters. 

Payrolls are expected to decline in second and third quarter, unemployment rate expected to peak at an average of 4.9% by the first quarter of 2024. Private investment including spending on equipment and structures are expected to fall 3% in the first three quarters of 2023. Industrial production is estimated a 0.7% decline on average in 2023.

The Senate aims to pass the bill by Thursday, to then have it signed by the President on Friday, giving the public and law makers little to no time to review it. It seems rushed and secretive.

‚ÅÉ	$38 billion in emergency funding to help Americans (natural disasters) 
‚ÅÉ	$2.6 billion for US Attorneys

‚ÅÉ	$5 billion for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund
‚ÅÉ	$8 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant (aids low income family‚Äôs with child care)
‚ÅÉ	$12 billion for the Head Start Program (aids children in low income families prepare for school)

‚ÅÉ	$576 million for the Environmental Protection Agency
‚ÅÉ	$132 million for the Capitol Police
‚ÅÉ	$3.6 billion for homeless assistance grants
‚ÅÉ	$6.4 billion to the Community Development Block Grant formula program
‚ÅÉ	$1.5 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program ( will build 10,000 new rental and homebuyer units)
‚ÅÉ	$4 billion to Navy's shipbuilding budget
‚ÅÉ	$8.5 billion to buy F-35 fighter jets and $2.5 billion to buy Boeing's new KC-46 tankers
‚ÅÉ	$1 billion to help developing countries expand their renewable energy efforts
‚ÅÉ	$950 million for Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop drugs to combat pandemics
‚ÅÉ	$965 million to the Strategic National Stockpile, (Nation's medical reserve)
‚ÅÉ	$770 million for federal law enforcement grants issued to local governments
‚ÅÉ	A pledge that the United States will deliver $11.4 billion annually by 2024 to help developing nations tackle climate change

1.

Securitization is larger than market knows and tranches will default as well

2. Buckingham palace will be stormed and the UK will vote to either go back into EU or the economy will suffer its largest contraction recession in decades and mass protests

3. New BOJ head (April) will shift policy and the JBG market will explode to 1% causing major losses to the bank and BOJ will be forced to sell ETF holdings and bonds onto market to defend , selling the equities can take over 100 years hit a big chunk will happen next year. Long YEN all year, short Nikkei

3. Macron will be forced out of office in France and a shift in party will take shape.

4. Italy will become more brazen and cause a lot of headaches for EU in 2023, which PIGS countries will undergo austerity measures or vote to leave EU or simply cause another European debt crisis

5. Mexico will be one of the best performing economies next year with AMLOs nationalization of lotion deposits and oil refineries and more friendly towards cattle agreements to not allow Canadian and Asian countries to plunder resources. Maybe even restructuring nafta agreement 

6. US unemployment will rise to mid 5s next year causing a surprise in data and consumers pairing back significantly in retail and e-commerce spending 



7. Credit Susie will be bought out or restructured causing a banking crisis short term for European banks

8. Gold wll see $3000 price tag per oz


9. Agriculture and farming will be overhauled with continued investment in agri automation and smart farms as farmers are being forced out and gov takes a more central role in our food supply. Also influencers and media will talk up insect protein and bugs eating more and more, beyond meat 3.0 


10. Price controls on commodities will hit in ferrous metals and some agri commodities next year

1170,StockMarket,"**OVERALL**: Slight relief today. The fact it came on light volume, and more from a time-perspective than a technical level, suggests only neutral to positive bias for tomorrow's price action.

 

**SPY**: Barely retraced back into yesterday's candle. If upside continues, first resistance is 385.18 and 389.63 gap window/fill -- with 394.30 and 399.40 gap window/fill as significant resistance.  For the bulls to regain control, the failed-breakout descending TL must be broken around 405.  If selling resumes tomorrow, modest support should come at 374.13 gap-fill, followed by a decade-old ascending TL around 365 until hitting major support at the 357.70 COVID-low TL.

**QQQ:** Price failed to close within yesterday's candle, but at least it did not validate the breakdown of its ascending TL. If upside continues, first resistance will be that ascending at TL 273.90 -- followed 280.72 where its previous bullish consolidation broke down -- then 282.25 to 286.51 are gap window/fill.  Similar to SPY, major resistance remains around 295 the pivot high TL.  If selling resumes tomorrow, first support is at 263.32 gap-fill, then it will hit major support between 260.85 to 261.21 the COVID-low TL.

**IWM:** The most solid retrace by any major, but on the least amount of volume.  If upside continues, first resistance will be gap-fills at 175.68 and 180.19 with major resistance between 186.40 to 185.95 at a confluence of descending TLs.  If selling resumes tomorrow, first support is 167.78 pre-COVID pivot high with major support  between 167.55 to 167.75 the COVID-low TL.

**Introduction**

As an investor, I have been highly interested in the precious metals market for the past couple of years. Having followed the history of money - particularly gold - I have been deeply impressed. As such, I recently began researching Aris Mining, a holding in a junior mining ETF. What I have discovered is that Aris Mining is an exceptional company that both operates its own properties and actively looks for new exploration opportunities.

https://preview.redd.it/37ehz5ggf37a1.png?width=240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3410ce0eb28206ce226107929edb778c2e77f894

**Exploration Project**

The Juby Project is an advanced exploration-stage gold project located in Ontario, Canada, 100 kilometres south-southeast of the Timmins gold camp. It is situated within the Shining Tree area in the southern part of the Abitibi greenstone belt, and is owned by GoldON Resources Ltd. The Project covers an area of 180.4 square kilometres and is comprised of 13 mining claims and one patented mining claim. The Juby Project has the potential to host multiple gold deposits, and has recently seen the completion of a positive Preliminary Economic Assessment, indicating a financially robust gold mine.

The Juby Project has excellent access to infrastructure including a major highway, a power transmission line that passes through the property, and an abundance of water in the region. The regional geological setting at Juby is similar to that of the Kirkland Lake and Timmins gold camps and is largely underexplored.

**Dividend History**

The most impressive part of Aris' books is its dividend history. As of this moment, the company has a forward dividend yield of 5.26% at $0.18 per share, which is higher than all of its previous dividends of $0.15. This increase in dividend yield is especially remarkable considering the current economic turmoil. This solid dividend performance speaks volumes about the soundness of Aris' financials and its ability to manage risk. This is a testament to the company's commitment to providing long-term value to its shareholders.

**Operating Mines**

***Segovia***

The Segovia Operations are located 180 kilometres northeast of Medell√≠n in the Segovia-Remedios mining district of Antioquia, Colombia. Segovia is a multi-million-ounce high-grade gold operation that has been producing gold for more than 150 years. The area is rich in gold deposits, and Segovia has been able to take advantage of this natural resource to create a successful and long-running business. The company is committed to responsible mining practices, and works to minimise its environmental impact. Segovia is a major contributor to the local economy, and provides employment for many people in the area.

***Marmato***

The Marmato gold district has been mined since pre-Colonial times by the Quimbaya people. The gold resource was so significant that Simon Bolivar, the revolutionary leader who liberated much of South America from Spanish rule, used the gold as collateral with British banks to secure funding for his war efforts. In more recent times, the Marmato gold district has been extensively mined by large-scale commercial operations, and is currently estimated to contain over $20 billion worth of gold reserves.

**Final Thoughts**

To be clear, I don't have any shares in Aris, but that might change in the future the way this company is headed. There are so many good aspects its hard to find any negative ones. They have producer that's creating an insane profit margin that's essentially 50% while spending capital on developing and exploring other sites. I can't wait to see what happens when they get the others online as well.

Additionally, the price is overextended from 8 and 21 EMA, so a price correction is needed. A rebound happened yesterday, but not enough to complete the price correction. I am expecting a further rebound for today.

  I found a weekly basis support around 35.5, and a daily basis resistance at around 36.21. Last Friday‚Äôs trade just tested the weekly basis support and price got pushed up later, so this support is still effective. On 15 mins chart, KDP went beyond and fell back to the daily basis support, and then the support did its job to hold the price. This to me is a signal that the daily basis support is working, but the power of this support needs more information to justify. With that said, I believe it's still a technically low point to entry in this sideways pattern of KDP.

1251,StockMarket,"Hello All,

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to write this post for a couple reasons and would love to hear input from the Vol and equity crowd. As I am sure you have seen on TWTR countless graphs superimposing 08s SP500 and VIX chart to 2022 there's supposedly going to be an impending spike in VIX and selloff in equities within 2-3 months. Now this may happen but let's see why this is likely not going to happen in the short term (1mth)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Showing the correlation coefficient between 08/22 graphs ) and looking at the charts fintwit loves to redraw their lines to make it seem like the pattern of price action between these two markets (VIX/SP500) is direct and almost 1.0 correlation is laughable. Digging through the data if anyone does basic research can show that right now corCoef is less than .70. Secondly, they can't explain why is it the price action doesn't compute when it was q1/q2 of this year to early 08 doesn't even correlate to less than .50 only that because prices are getting tighter NOW is when it's starting to line up. This is false. 

2. Open interest and new positions on VIX the last couple days. So I saw on Twitter today all these breaking news handles showing big OI positions being opened in the JAN 30 VIX calls - where someone purchased a block position of 27109call contracts ($2.81mm) and think this is a catalyst of someone knows something pending going to happen. This also appeared in the Jul 75calls 10,000 ($820,000) and in other calls ranging out to March over 6mm notational. 

This is RETAIL!!

How do I know, well, as a firm that strictly trades asymetric vol and tail events, retail always does this shit near market ST bottoms. Why? Because they have been seeing their long only portfolios go down and instead of being institutional building a position in smaller chunks to not give away their position and become overly concentrated in one chain, they always buy BLOCKS all at once. Institutional does not do this. The cost to insure on VIX right now is high going out to 50 calls and anything higher than that, is a long shot less than 0.03% of occurannce for payout so Retail always buys these 'protection hedges' without realizing or understanding their greeks. They just think I have several million in a long only potfolio and will purchase what I percive is cheap insurance and not look elsewhere. 

Institutional was buying protection when value and options pricing was cheapest in the last quarter and this was last week of November and in doing it in smaller chunks. And insitutional knew that this was also high so buying protection on SOFR, CDS, calls on JPY or CHF was a better play than outright VIX action. 

So why should we care and what does this all mean. The block orders coming in on VIX right now on egregious call prices is hedging on long only, not understanding their payoffs, and those who are going to be trapped selling back these options at much lower prices in the comping 2-14 days. Now that they have bot all these call options and exposed themselves in a certain chain, guys like us or others who spot this abnormal volume will supress prices and sell more calls to these individuals and will see their options level off or theta kicks in. The market is oversold at these levels, and yes could we have a major correction? Of course. But it wont be this week or even next week. 

&amp;#x200B;

The rant or wisdom however you want to take it is when you see big OI positions take place in stupid prices of VIX way OTM or ATM for less than 60days happen, usually the market is near a bottom at least short term before retesting older resistance levels at higher prices on SP500. If we revisit this post this time this week, the market will be say 4-5% higher, and those options chains will be much lower with forced selling because now they dominate the majority of the OI and they have to sell it back to those not willing to pay a 30% premium to where prices should be given options models. 

&amp;#x200B;

So when you see more posts on TWTR this week talking about the superimposed SP500 and VIX mimicking 08 and a combination of big orders hitting VIX in BLOCKS, This is retail and not insitutional and retail is usually wrong in spots like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dear XXXXX,  


Today, we took an important step toward our goal of returning assets to clients through our chapter 11 cases. It is our belief that clients unambiguously own the digital assets in their BlockFi Wallet Accounts. As such, we filed a motion requesting authority from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to allow clients to withdraw digital assets that are held in their BlockFi Wallet Accounts. We will be seeking similar relief from the Supreme Court of Bermuda with respect to BlockFi Wallet Accounts held at BlockFi International Ltd. This motion does not impact withdrawals or transfers from BlockFi Interest Accounts, which remain paused at this time.  


In order to facilitate withdrawals from BlockFi Wallet Accounts, we also requested permission to update the User Interface to properly reflect transactions as of the platform pause on November 10, 2022 at 8:15 p.m. (prevailing Eastern Time). This is a necessary step towards ensuring all clients are treated fairly and that the User Interface properly reflects the digital assets in Wallet Accounts as of the pause so BlockFi can honor all withdrawal requests from Wallet Accounts properly if authorized by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and, with respect to BlockFi International Ltd., the Supreme Court of Bermuda.  


While filing this motion is an initial step, we will continue to work towards solutions that maximize value for all clients and other stakeholders and will share updates as quickly as practicable.  


We are looking forward to discussing this motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and key parties in our cases, and expeditiously moving towards a path that returns Wallet Accounts assets to clients. We expect that our request will be heard by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court at our hearing currently scheduled for January 9, 2023, at 10:00am ET. We expect that our request for similar relief with respect to BlockFi International Ltd. will be first heard before the Supreme Court of Bermuda at our hearing currently scheduled for January 13, 2023 at 10:30am AST and then scheduled for a full hearing after that on a date to be fixed.  


Additional information regarding our chapter 11 cases, including court documents and claim information, can be found by visiting BlockFi‚Äôs claims agent Kroll at https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/blockfi.Clients with questions about the process may call Kroll at (888) 773-0375 (Toll Free) or (646) 440-4371 (International), or email blockfiinfo@ra.kroll.com

1254,StockMarket,,How the World‚Äôs Central Banks Orchestrated the Coming Recession,1671499365
1255,StockMarket,"Many people might be confused and horrified to see the market falling, falling, falling. The JPow said that the terminal rate would go (slightly) higher than expected previously, and that the Fed would hold interest rates at the terminal rate throughout 2023. Just that catalyst has triggered days of red across the major indexes, with little sign of abating. Why is this happening?

Market participants, primarily institutions, are forward-looking. They're not reacting to what's happening right now, but to what they expect will happen three to six months from now. Essentially, prices are moving down as if the recession and other bad events were already happening *right now*. What we're seeing is insane.

Consider the current prices of three companies and their pandemic lows:

    AMZN: $84.92/share v. $81.33/share. 
    PYPL: $68.95/share v. $82.38/share. 
    VZ: $37.03/share v. $48.97/share.

The bad news is already happening, long before a real recession, *in anticipation* of that recession. I have no idea how low prices will go, or over what period of time. But I can reasonably predict that the nose will pull up *before* macroeconomic conditions start to improve. (This could be years away, though.) 

Going forward, what should we expect?

By the end of H1 2023, the Fed will have done whatever it's going to do, and all of that will finally, *finally*, well and truly have been priced *in*. The problem is that what it will have done will have led to lots of people being fired. Corporate earnings will drop. Guidance will weaken. Share prices will drift downward, on the whole. This ""deep freeze"" is what will bring inflation under control. 

There will, however, be other problems. Our economy runs on credit. We buy lots of things using our credit cards. We buy cars on credit. We take out mortgage loans to buy houses. The Fed is removing credit from the market. Because people don't want to pay a fortune in interest, they'll defer major purchases as much as they can. Being afraid of losing their jobs will also inhibit large purchases. 

Most companies run on credit, even if they have positive cash flow. They're always trying to grow and expand, which they finance through debt (i.e. borrowing money). In these restrictive economic conditions, it will cost them a lot more in interest to secure loans, and the size of the loans will be smaller than they were able to secure before, due to credit risk. 

Taken together, there's no place for share prices to go *but* down over time. I suspect that SPY will drop meaningfully (e.g. at least 10.00%) in 2023, although flatlining for a protracted period of time is also possible. I also expect the CPI to continue to decrease, but the cost for achieving that isn't clear yet. Expect growing personal and corporate bankruptcies and loan defaults, lower corporate earnings, weakening guidance, and lower share prices in 2023. 

When will the market truly bottom?

It could happen in the summer of 2023, or two years later. No one knows because no matter which macroeconomic data you look at, there are too many ambiguities and unpredictable variables to be able to make any conclusion, such as the course of the Ukraine war, whether the EU will find itself in a devastating recession (this is relevant because it's such a huge trading partner of ours), and the price of oil (energy prices are a key input into every economy). We also can't forget about the evolution of the pandemic virus and the ongoing risks and problems that it creates world-wide. 

My own impression is that the market conditions are going to be bad for a long time. Everywhere we turn, we find bad news.

If this is true, what can we do?

I'm doing two things. 

First, when prices become unrealistically cheap (look at PLTR, for instance), I'm shorting a large number of puts at even more unrealistic striking prices. Those who don't trade options can start DCA'ing (slowly). If you're afraid of growth stocks, consider TMUS or VZ, which should prove resilient in a recession because people aren't going to cancel their cell phone plans. Those companies' cash flows are secure, and you can also benefit from dividend payments. 

Second, I'm very carefully making explicit bearish bets, such as a *Long Put Spread* on MDB, which is currently profitable and will hopefully become more so over the coming weeks. It's very dangerous to make bearish bets in a bear market (ironically) because of the risk of a sudden and violent relief rally. But there's also something to be said for not fighting the trend, and the trend has been down, down, down.

I'm a pretty good trader. (I booked $100k in a period of nine days in 2020, for example.) In a bear market, I feel lucky to book $1,000 in a month from trading. It's just too dangerous to scale substantially into plays, no matter which strategy you use, because bear markets are characterized by high volatility, which means that your win rate is going to drop substantially, and because you have to bet a lot of money to make just a little money, even a single loss can cause a large drawdown. 

The only way for us to get through this nightmare is to be very patient, and understand that it's not going to end in 2023, which is going to be a bad year. Eventually, new market leaders will emerge. We don't need the market to regain all-time highs anytime soon. We just need it to be stable to make money. We're a long way away from that point.

Finally‚ÄîI'm sorry for the welter of bad tidings‚Äîconsider SPY, going back fifteen years. Draw a trend line through it. Whether looking at that trend line, or the Buffett Indicator, we can see that the market is overvalued and can reasonably infer that it has to drop. The conditions are unfortunately ripe to cause it to do just that.

Hunker down for the long haul. My long-term guess is that even though things are pretty bad for us, they're much worse for other countries. Everything in the Money Game is relative. Although I don't know when things will stabilize, let alone reverse, I believe that when they *do* reverse, America will lead the world.

And *we* will go on to make a killing!

Hang in there, everyone.

1274,StockMarket," [Bureau of Labor Statistics Press Release](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/24/2022-17994/updating-spending-weights-annually-based-on-a-single-calendar-year-of-data) \- *Effective with the February 2023 release of CPI data for January 2023, BLS will update weights annually for the Consumer Price Index based on a single calendar year of data, using consumer expenditure data from 2021. This change impacts the CPI for urban consumers (CPI-U), wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W), initial and interim versions of the Chained CPI-U, and CPI research series. This reflects a change from prior practice of updating weights biennially using two years of expenditure data. This shift will result in changes to some documents available from CPI, including the CPI Relative Importance tables Report and CPI Handbook of Methods.*

**I've been exchanging emails with an economist at the BLS and here is what I've gotten back from him.**

*The overall methodology will be basically the same. The main change will be that weights will be based on more recent data. For example, historically we had two years of data (e.g. 2019-2020) that had to be updated to the December pivot month (e.g. December 2021) by the change from the average index value in 2019-2020 to the index value in December 2021. Now, with the January 2023 update, it will be 2021 data updated to the December 2022 pivot month by the change from the average index value in 2021 to the December 2022 index value. As for how it will impact CPI and core CPI, obviously any differences in weight allocations will translate in differences in the impact of various categories on overall inflation, but we can‚Äôt make any predictions at this point.*

Essentially, the previous method would have used 2019-2020 weight data, updated by price change and now it will be 2021 weight data, updated by price change. He wouldn't discuss how this could possibly change the CPI and Core CPI numbers but I will probably be looking to close out any positions prior to this print as I think there could be a serious rug pull in the same way that healthcare calculations changed in October.

If you look back at my previous posts you'll see that I'm not optimistic about the future performance of the market but my conspiracy brain is telling me there is a greater than zero chance that they'll try to inflict maximum damage over the next 2.5 months, there will be another clear leg down as the 5% terminal rate gets digested by the market and the Q1 2023 earnings disappoint and then when the February CPI prints and it shows a dramatic drop the Fed will back off their current hawkish projections SLIGHTLY as they are still not going to want to dramatically ease financial conditions. At least that's what I'm thinking now and I'll be looking to close as many positions as I can at a profit before this release because it's going to be a major wildcard.",Bull/Bear Warning: February 2023 CPI Print WILL BE A WILDCARD,1671477170

1284,StockMarket,"In a letter to Tesla‚Äôs board, the Democratic senator asks whether investors have been harmed by the billionaire tech mogul‚Äôs time running the social network.

Elon Musk‚Äôs chaotic tenure running Twitter has already drawn scrutiny from an array of international government officials, who have professed concern about his changes to content moderation, including the suspension of several journalists, and new restrictions on promoting rival social networks. (The Musk management style was again on display after his followers voted to give him the boot as the Twitter C.E.O. in a poll he ran overnight; more on the latest head-snapping developments later.)

Now, DealBook is first to report, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, is taking aim at an issue with more serious potential legal consequences: whether Mr. Musk has created a series of conflicts of interest with and misappropriation of resources from Tesla, the electric carmaker he also runs.

*‚ÄúAs you know, it is the legal obligation of Tesla‚Äôs board to ensure that its C.E.O. is meeting all his legal responsibilities and serving as an effective leader,‚Äù Ms. Warren wrote in a letter to Robyn Denholm, Tesla‚Äôs chairwoman, on Sunday night. (Ms. Denholm did not respond to a request for comment.) While the chaos at Twitter isn‚Äôt Tesla‚Äôs concern, Ms. Warren raised the possibility that many of Mr. Musk‚Äôs actions may be shortchanging Tesla.*

Ms. Warren asked whether Mr. Musk‚Äôs diverting of resources from Tesla ‚Äî including software engineers and senior executives ‚Äî is harming the carmaker. In her letter, the senator also questioned whether Mr. Musk‚Äôs assertion that their being seconded to Twitter was purely voluntary, citing an anonymous employee who told CNBC, ‚Äúmost would also feel it was impossible to turn down a direct request from Mr. Musk without later facing poor performance reviews or other consequences.‚Äù

Ms. Warren also suggested the possibility of Mr. Musk **intentionally shortchanging either Twitter or Tesla to benefit the other**, including Twitter potentially overcharging Tesla for ads or tweaking the social network‚Äôs algorithms to benefit the carmaker. She also asked the board whether content appearing on Twitter under Mr. Musk‚Äôs new content moderation, including a rise in misinformation and what the senator said was hate speech, could end up hurting Tesla‚Äôs reputation.

* **Louise Abbott, a partner at law firm Keystone Law, told CNBC the exchange‚Äôs demise is ‚Äúdevastating for investors.‚Äù**

&amp;#x200B;

The collapse of FTX, once a $32 billion crypto exchange, has shattered investor confidence in cryptocurrencies. Market players are trying to gauge the extent of damage it has caused ‚Äî and how it will reshape the industry in the years to come.

Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX‚Äôs former boss who stepped down on Nov. 11, was arrested in the Bahamas last week. He has been charged by the U.S. government with wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering.

FTX connected buyers and sellers of digital currencies like bitcoin, as well as derivatives. However, the company did more than that, allegedly dipping into client accounts to make risky trades through its sister firm Alameda Research.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hugely disappointing for investors, or more so devastating for investors,‚Äù said Louise Abbott, a partner at law firm Keystone Law who specializing in crypto-asset recovery and fraud.

It‚Äôs clear the FTX drama could radically reshape crypto in the years to come. Here are three big ways the industry could change.

## 1. Regulation

For one, the disaster will looks certain to stir regulators into action.

Crypto as an industry is still largely unregulated, meaning investors don‚Äôt have the same protections they would have placing their funds with a licensed bank or broker.

That may be about to change. Governments in the U.S., European Union and the U.K. are taking steps to clean up the market.

The EU‚Äôs Markets in Crypto-Assets is the most comprehensive regulatory framework to date. It aims to reduce the risks for consumers buying crypto, making exchanges liable if they lose investors‚Äô assets.

But MICA is not due to start until 12 months from now. Keystone Law‚Äôs Abbott said it‚Äôs important that regulators act quickly.

‚ÄúPeople need to see that there‚Äôs steps being taken to regulate it. And I think If we are able to offer some regulation, we will build confidence,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs no regulation, the investors are left without that protection that they need.‚Äù

The saga has set back adoption of crypto assets by ‚Äúone or two years,‚Äù according to Evgeny Gaevoy, founder and CEO of crypto market maker Wintermute.

‚ÄúEverything that failed this year, if you look at Celsius, Three Arrows, FTX now ‚Äî all those guys were taking the worst of both worlds because they were not completely decentralized, and they were not properly centralized either,‚Äù he said.

For Kevin de Patoul, CEO of crypto market maker Wintermute, the biggest lesson from FTX‚Äôs bankruptcy is that ‚Äúyou cannot have complete centralization and lack of oversight.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are evolving to a world where you are going to have both centralization and decentralization,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen you do have that centralization, you need to have proper oversight and a proper balance of power.‚Äù

## 2. Consolidation

Many new companies and projects emerged in the years that followed the 2018 crypto winter ‚Äî FTX among them. The expectation now is that fewer firms and coins will exist in the years to come.

Contagion from the FTX saga is already playing out.

Crypto lender BlockFi, which earlier sought financial assistance from FTX, has entered bankruptcy. Now, attention is turning to other trading and lending firms, like Gemini and Genesis.

‚ÄúThe challenge for the whole space when you think about contagion is that FTX and Alameda were extremely active investors in this space,‚Äù Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain.com, said in a CNBC-moderated talk at a crypto conference in London.

Near Foundation, which is behind a blockchain network called Near, was among the firms that took investment from FTX. Marieke Flament, Near‚Äôs CEO, said the firm had limited exposure to FTX ‚Äî though the collapse was still ‚Äúa surprise and a shock.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think all the dominoes have fallen out from the contagion,‚Äù Flament said. ‚ÄúThe impact that this will have is that a lot of projects actually are not going to have the funds, and therefore the resources, for them to continue and develop.‚Äù

Fears have risen over the financial health of other major crypto exchanges after FTX‚Äôs failure. Since early 2020, about 900,000 bitcoins have flowed out of exchanges, according to data from CryptoQuant.

Binance, the world‚Äôs largest exchange, is facing questions about the reserves it holds to backstop customer funds. The company saw billions of dollars in outflows in the past week.

Currently, there is no reason to suspect Binance faces any risk of bankruptcy. But exchanges like Binance and Coinbase face a bleak market backdrop ahead amid falling trading volumes and account balances.

Experts believe they‚Äôll continue to play a role ‚Äî though their survival will be determined by how seriously they take risk management, governance and regulation.¬†

‚ÄúThere will be exchanges that are doing things the right way and that will survive,‚Äù said Abbott.

As for tokens ‚Äî bitcoin, being the longest-living digital currency, may be better positioned than its smaller rivals.

‚ÄúMy bet would be that bitcoin and DeFi \[decentralized finance\] are decoupled from the rest of crypto and actually start to have a life of its own,‚Äù Gaevoy from Wintermute told CNBC.

## 3. Innovation

Despite the depressed state of crypto markets, and the toll it‚Äôs taken on investors, the digital asset industry is likely to pull through.

Proponents of ‚ÄúWeb3,‚Äù a hypothetical blockchain-based internet, expect 2022‚Ä≤s crypto winter to pave the way for more innovative uses of blockchain, rather than the speculative uses crypto is associated with today.

‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre seeing a lot is companies having digital innovation arms or metaverse innovation arms,‚Äù Flament said. ‚ÄúThey understand that the technology is here. It‚Äôs not going to go away.‚Äù

NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, could alter users‚Äô relationships with properties in games and events, for example. These are digital assets that track ownership of unique virtual items on the blockchain.

‚ÄúDigital assets will be an increasing part of our lives, whether that is a collectible, a ticket, value, identity,‚Äù Ian Rogers, chief experience officer at crypto wallet firm Ledger, told CNBC. ‚ÄúIdentity could be membership ... \[people\] using NFTs they own to get access to a particular event or something like that.‚Äù

But for many, there‚Äôs still a learning curve to overcome. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard creating wallets and storing keys and going through different platforms,‚Äù Cordel Robbin-Coker, CEO of mobile games firm Carry1st, told CNBC at the Slush startup conference in Helsinki, Finland.

Robbin-Coker compared Web3 today with the internet in the early 90s. ‚ÄúIt was clunky. You had dial-up, it took four minutes to get on, the original web browsers were not very intuitive,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really the early adopters that really engage at that stage. But over time, companies build smoother interfaces. And they cut steps out of it.""",The FTX disaster has set back crypto by ‚Äòyears‚Äô ‚Äî here are 3 ways it could reshape the industry,1671422896

So, as stated for last 6 months keep an eye on the fed watch-tool.  ""[CMEgroup.com](https://CMEgroup.com)"", Keep an eye on March23 and May23.  That 5% peak level is key and secondarily how long we are going to hold that before a cut. Refer to ""CME group Chart"".

Second, price definitively broke down when Friday closed below what had been bullish consolidation within the micro trend.  The sharp move down which started on Tuesday and continued to Friday puts price extended on the shorter time frame. We could see a small bounce at any point between Monday to Wednesday. This bounce could occur off the next support level at 374.13, or 363.54 - 362.17 as  moderate support.  Major support this week is at the ascending TL from the COVID low: 357.43 (Monday) to 358.14 (Friday).  When the bounce comes, upside will be limited. 389.63 and 399.40 are both gap fills from the most recent move.  Major resistance this week is from that aforementioned descending TL: 405.61 (Monday) to 404.35 (Friday).

**QQQ:**   Both macro &amp; micro trends are now bearish; however, there is slightly more bullish sentiment if Friday's low does in fact create an ascending trend line on the micro timeframe. The sharp move down which started on Tuesday and continued to Friday puts price extended on the shorter time frame. We could see a small bounce at any point between Monday to Wednesday. The next moderate support level is 263.32 gap-fill. Major support this week is at the ascending TL from the COVID low: 260.70 (Monday) to 261.21 (Friday). When the bounce comes, upside will be limited: 282.25 and 286.51 are the gap window &amp; fill from the most recent move.  Major resistance this week is from the descending TL which price failed to reach, let along break through, this previous week: 296.15 (Monday) to 294.40 (Friday).

**IWM:**  Both macro &amp; micro trends remain bearish. As a ""leading indicator"" for the major indices, IWM is a full candle ""ahead"" of SPY and QQQ in terms of having its previous bullish consolidation fail &amp; price falling below those support levels. By comparison, there are less technical indicators here as price hit gap-fill at Friday's low. Next moderate support is 167.78 -- former pivot high just prior to COVID. Major support is coming into this same level from the COVID low: 167.31 (Monday) to 167.75 (Friday). When the bounce comes, upside will be limited: there is an immediate gap-fill at 175.68 and another at 180.19 from the most recent move.  Major resistance this week is from a confluence of descending TLs; the first is from 186.77 (Monday) to 185.95 (Friday).

1334,StockMarket,"The reality is that

1) In a bear market like these days, most stocks just keep dropping for no fundamental reason. It‚Äôs just emotions and market pressure. If you‚Äôre short or have puts, you‚Äôll make money.

2) In a bull market, when some stock jumps say 40% because of a good earning or good news, usually within a few days all that gain is wiped out and if anything it goes below what it was before the news. So at the end, with some patience, again shorts win.

While calls / buying shares can hypothetically be profitable, it is designed for the hedge funds and big investors (billion dollars) and tends to fail if your account is couple thousand or hundred of thousands or even a million.

So in summary, I believe that general public should only short or buy puts at any given time. This is not an investment advice obviously but I hope that general public can make more money to survive this crazy inflation.

1358,StockMarket," Learning about how stocks work here so please bear with me. From what I learned so far, I know that stocks are a way of basically fundraising a lot of capital that they can use to fund business operations to grow and become more profitable. And this is why many companies will opt to go public instead of solely running on private VC backing.

But what about after all the outstanding shares are bought up and the stock begins trading on a secondary market such as the NYSE/NASDAQ exchanges? How does this activity affect the company and its business performance?  
Now I'm specifically asking about how the performance of the stock's price in a secondary market affects the company, if at all, and not the other way around of how the company's performance affects the stock price.  
I know that in terms of how a company affects its stock price, it's mainly driven by supply and demand, and on a deeper level that supply and demand is impacted greatly by large institutional investors and analysts that analyze the fundamentals of a company to determine its intrinsic value vs. it's market value to see if its price is a justified one.

But what about in the cases where a stock's price drastically changes maybe due to market manipulation and hype, which has little to nothing to do with a company's performance? Such as Gamestop? I knew it blew up like crazy due to the hype, but how did that affect the company and its operations? I imagine that it did nothing to the company right? Because after all the stocks of a company gets bought up, that's it, they achieved their fundraising objective and however those shares are resold in a secondary market exchange is the individual investor's business, unless it does something like issue out more stocks, right?  
So I'm assuming that in the case of, Gamestop, that crazy stock performance did nothing for the company in general and their business operations continued as normal, and it merely left the company a hot topic to talk about among the media, investors, and the board of directors.

Sorry if my line of questioning is a bit scattered, it's just how I'm trying to organize my thoughts and confusion while typing this out. But hopefully, my understanding is somewhat correct and my questions make sense haha. Thanks in advance.",How does a stock's performance in a secondary market affect the company??,1671329453

1377,StockMarket,"Green Giant Inc. (NASDAQ: GGE), a provider of green energy solutions, has been relatively flat since December,in a trend of consolidation at a high level. Both the long and short sides seem to be deadlocked and the stock price lacks directions. However, from a technical perspective, GGE released positive signals at the end of November, forming a golden crossing of the moving average.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lp0kzd4iwh6a1.png?width=554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc834e222ec282a68dd4f0d819a794d8ded63c98

The ""golden crossing"" of the moving average means that the rising short-term moving average crosses the rising long-term moving average from bottom to top. At this time, the pressure line is broken up, indicating that the stock price will continue to rise and the market is optimistic about it.

GGE's cross between the 50-day moving average and 200-day moving average at the end of November is the golden cross of the moving average, which is also one of the positive signals valued by technical analysts. Therefore, from the technical point of view, GGE is in the consolidation trend, but the overall trend is still bullish. I even think that this stock has the potential to soar in the future. Why?

First of all, GGE is a small cap stock with a market value of less than US $150 million and only 22.47 million float shares, and small cap stocks usually have the potential to soar. GGE's surge ability in early October has already shown us. In only three trading days, GGE's share price rose from a low of $0.66 to a high of $2.82, with a return of 327%.

In view of the small cap characteristics of GGE, I believe that once GGE has good news, its share price is expected to rise, bringing amazing returns to shareholders.

The following are several incentives that may drive GGE's price: broad prospects of green energy, favorable policies on green energy in the United States, and GGE's business progress.",GGE releases positive signals technically with soaring potential,1671299764

1396,StockMarket,"As always, this in not financial advice. This is simply a public reflection of my thoughts on the year as it relates to my portfolio. Due your own due diligence and don‚Äôt trust the words of a random stranger on the internet.

This year I will likely end the year with a return -30% to -40%, currently down about 35%. As I have done (not on reddit) for several years now, I like to reflect on the quality of my decisions and the outcomes.

Entering 2022 I had the following holdings: GOOGL, AXP, BRKB, CHE, CHWY, CNSWF, DPZ, HIFS, LMND, MSFT, SPGI, SCI, TMX, TSLA, TOITF, U, YETI

During the year, I made the mistake of moving aggressively into beaten down low-quality tech. Names like U, LMND, PLTR, UPST, DDOG, OKTA, SHOP, TEAM, TOST. In terms of the quality of the decisions I would say that I was that I did not make complete well-rounded decisions. On one hand, I generally applaud myself for buying companies when they are out of favor. These names were down 40 to 60% at the time of purchase. Where I did not do well was look at more than factors other than torrid growth rate and a bright future fed to me on the beautiful pages embedded on their investor presentations (let‚Äôs look at that and avoid the skeletons in the 10-Q I said to myself). These companies were bought with too much sunshine and not enough rain.

I should have reviewed additional factors:

First, how are the financials trending other than growth. Sure, revenue was going up gangbusters, what about margins, or dilution or capital requirements, Revenue/EE, Revenue/Sh etc. As I dug under the hood later in the year most of these companies made no advancement on margins despite torrid revenue growth. I realized not digging this far was very very stupid.

Additionally, I realized throughout time the competitive landscape has changed and I need to update my assessment as well. Take DataDog. My belief about their competitive positioning was ‚Äúdue to the nature of their mission critical software companies are not likely to leave them due to the high switching costs.‚Äù One day I went over my portfolio holding by holding and I realized that I had virtually all software names that had an advantage in my view that stemmed from a switching cost. It kind of hit me this is ridiculous. How can every company have a switching cost advantage? The cloud changed everything. Without the need for servers, it is much easier to simply move from one company to another. Now of course there are still training costs and implementation costs to be sure, but the barriers to create software have never been lower and the number of options has never been higher.

The realization that switching costs in my opinion is not stringent enough of a definition led me to investigate competitive advantages further. As I do often when I feel I have lost my way in investing, I revisit some legendary texts. This time, I revisited Terry Smith‚Äôs Owner‚Äôs Manual ([https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf](https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf)). In there, he has a section where he speaks about the types of companies they like. Here is what it said:

‚ÄúWe seek to invest in businesses whose assets are intangible and difficult to replicate

It may seem counter-intuitive to seek businesses which do not rely upon tangible assets, but bear with us. The businesses we seek to invest in do something very unusual: they break the rule of mean reversion that states returns must revert to the average as new capital is attracted to business activities earning super-normal returns.

They can do this because their most important assets are not physical assets, which can be replicated by anyone with access to capital, but intangible assets, which can be very difficult to replicate, no matter how much capital a competitor is willing to spend. Moreover, it‚Äôs hard for companies to replicate these intangible assets using borrowed funds, as banks tend to favor the (often illusory) comfort of tangible collateral. This means that the business does not suffer from economically irrational (or at least innumerate) competitors when credit is freely available.‚Äù

This section gave me an epiphany! To sum it up, businesses with competitive advantages are built in a way that capital alone is unable to reproduce. In other words, there has to be an intangible factor that capital is unable to recreate. I combined this idea with the other questions I typically ask myself.

¬∑ **Company Soundness**

o Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

¬∑ **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is their evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

o Is their evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

o What is the competitive advantage?

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

¬∑ **Growth**

o Is their a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

¬∑ **Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

Answering these questions brought down a watchlist of \~75 names to 26.

This filter took names like Amazon off my list. In my opinion, Amazon derives most of its advantage from a long recurring investment in capital. Distribution centers for their retail business and data centers for AWS. Over time as firms have invested in DTC, this has marginalized much of Amazon‚Äôs advantage. Additionally, as more cloud players come into the space, the investment in data centers is becoming more common. Ironically, my opinion on Amazon is add odds with Terry Smith given his position in Amazon. As they say, that is what makes a market. Just pull up annual return on assets and you will see one of the reasons why Amazon is plummeting.

Below is my refined list of 26 companies and why I feel capital alone will be able to replicate them sorted alphabetically by name.

Company Ticker Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB Network Effect for Airbnb's. Customers want to shop for Airbnb's where the hosts are. Host want to list where the customers are.

American Express Company AXP Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

Apple Inc. AAPL Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want phones where they can access the services they customarily use. The Duopoly has been attacked by Microsoft and Amazon, yet we still only have two phone systems.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B Reputation. BRK's reputation has a financial powerhouse makes its insurance division one of the few insurers that can be trusted with large and complex risks. Additionally, management unique operating structure allows for very little conglomerate penalty due to the individual management of many businesses.

BlackRock, Inc. BLK Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history with Blackrock and iShares it will be difficult to upset these funds

Blackstone Inc. BX Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history across many alternatives it is difficult to select a smaller player.

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F Decentralized operating culture. Management acquires small niche vertically integrated software providers. Their capital allocation is uniquely pushed down to distant levels fromtop management which allows them to scale acquisitions on a decentralized basis. This extremely unique management approach is not something money can buy.

Costco Wholesale Corporation COST Low-Cost Provider. By selling items virtually at cost along with leveraging negotiating powers to drive lowest prices Costco has cemented a foothold in retail. All this value is captured in their annual membership fee.

CRA International, Inc. CRAI Reputation. Within Business consulting, CRAI has a reputation for solving large complex solutions across many industries. When a consultant work with 78 of the fortune 100, you know that paying high fees for results is worth it.

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD Network Effect. CRWD's cloud-based cybersecurity solutions and massive customer base allows for quick handling of threats. As one threat is dealt with, the solutions are synced through the rest of their cloud-based service. This means helping one client helps all and the more customers the strong the service.

Fair Isaac Corporation FICO Regulatory Entrenchment and track record. The FICO score is synonymous with personal lending. Often it is a key determinant for determining loan eligibility. Given its efficient track record at quantifying risk, newer options will be behind as they don't have the track record.

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS Culture of Discipline. There are many banks in this world, virtually none of them are as efficient as HIFS. Their disciplined culture toward underwriting leads to lower than industry average charge offs annually while their focus on costs leads to above industry profitability. If you could re-create this with capital, banks with more scale would have similar returns.

IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. IDXX Trade Secrets. IDXX offers many proprietary tests for vets. This means that only IDXX labs can process them. Additionally, many vets are trained on their tests meaning switching would result in the need for new training.

Lemonade, Inc. LMND Potential to be low-Cost provider and culture of customer care. By offering insurance DTC, Lemonade can avoid many entrenched costs from agency model. Additionally, by getting Guinness World Records for fastest claim paid and removing the frustrating part of insurance which is using it, they have the potential to earn pricing power over time

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU Network Effect. In Latin America they are the leading provider of a P2P payment system (like Venmo). They have captured sizeable portions of the populations in Brazil, Mexico and Columbia.

RLI Corp. RLI Disciplined Underwriting culture and unique track record. Their underwriting culture had led to a 10 BPs lower combined ratio and lower ratio every year for the last decade. Money can't buy discipline. They insure a broad spectrum of odd risks. These are both not easily replicated but offer great diversification in their operations.

Rollins, Inc. ROL Low-Cost Provider. As the largest player in most of their markets, Rollin's benefits from major scale advantages. More contracts allow for pest control people to have greater route density during a day and therefore greater profits as well as negotiate better terms on inputs. This is something that a competitor is unable to solve by throwing money at it. Additionally with high brand awareness with Orkin man, they have a step up on smaller lesser-known players.

Roper Technologies, Inc. ROP Decentralized operating culture focused on end markets that benefit from efficient scale. Efficient scale is when an end market is logically only served by one player in a small area, like a freelance truck distributor. If you are looking for a delivery truck, it makes sense that one website would be best for that.

S&amp;P Global Inc. SPGI Regulatory Entrenchment and Track Record. S&amp;Ps credit rating are required by many contracts and regulations for many debt deals. If you need money and your bank requires it, you‚Äôre going to pay a hefty fee for their rating. Additionally, they own the IP for the S&amp;P and Dow Jones indexes. These long track records will never be replaced due to their entrenchment and first mover advantage.

Salesforce, Inc. CRM Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Salesforce is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

ServiceNow, Inc. NOW Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. ServiceNow is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

Shopify Inc. SHOP Network effect. For eCommerce players that are looking to compete independently from the likes of Amazon, Shopify is their lifeblood. This means that App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Smaller player and late entries like BigCommerce have struggled to gain traction

Tesla, Inc. TSLA Network effect, Brand, Unique Operating Culture in a tough industry. Network effects stem from outsized number of cars on road all outfitted with self-driving equipment giving Tesla more data to develop self-driving cars giving them a data advantage for developing self-driving cars. Additionally, Tesla is the undisputed electric vehicle king given their first mover advantage. Finally, they operate differently than most of their competitors. They build the important and unique components in house whereas legacy auto tends to outsource all parts and simply assemble them. They sell DTC at retail prices whereas legacy auto sell wholesale to dealers. They have a standard labor force whereas most of legacy auto has unionized labor which is trained on legacy ICE engines. The auto industry is historically difficult to enter as it requires large amounts of capital, high fixed costs with a cyclical product.

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN You can't re-create the limited supply of mountains in the world. There are so many mountains and locations with the proper weather conditions to enable skiing. This gives them pricing power, particularly when you account for how many mountains they own in many regions.

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN Government granted monopoly. All .com and .net domains must be registered with VRSN. Additionally, price increases are regulated. Fortunately, ROCs are not

Visa Inc. V Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

From there I reviewed the 26 companies by valuation and felt 15 of them are compelling investments at this time:

Company Ticker Target

Visa Inc. V 10.00%

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B 10.00%

Blackstone Inc. BX 8.00%

American Express Company AXP 8.00%

Salesforce, Inc. CRM 8.00%

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F 8.00%

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS 6.00%

Tesla, Inc. TSLA 6.00%

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN 6.00%

Lemonade, Inc. LMND 5.00%

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU 5.00%

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB 5.00%

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN 5.00%

Shopify Inc. SHOP 5.00%

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD 5.00%

I feel much more confident in the portfolio after re-reviewing the soundness, ability to be replicated, future growth prospects. They key for future years is to avoid laziness when analyzing names. It is foolhardy and expensive to fall in love with an investor presentation and then go and buy it on hopes and dreams rather than seeing the larger picture.

The ironic thing is I have owned 14 of the 15 at some point in my life. For one reason or another I got shaken out of them and bought into the temptress that goes by the name of high growth. Like most temptresses, more research reveals not much substance.

For next steps, I will work on integrating the above process into my stock review routine and stick to it. I find that the hardest part with investing is simply sticking to a practical approach. Its too easy to waver to something new. Variety is the spice of life, but makes for the taste of cocoa powder in investments.

*****
&gt; Stocks dropped Friday, building on their year-end sell-off, as fears grow over a recession taking place as the Federal Reserve continues raising rates.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 281.76 points, or 0.85%, to 32,920.46. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.11% to 3,852.36. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 0.97% to 10,705.41.
*****
&gt; The indexes notched a second consecutive week of losses. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.08% for the week, and putting its December losses at 5.58%, as hopes for a year-end rally fizzle. The Dow and Nasdaq slid 1.7% and 2.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Trading was especially volatile Friday with a large amount of options expiring. There were $2.6 trillion worth of index options expiring, the highest amount ‚Äúrelative to the size of the equity market in nearly two years,‚Äù according to Goldman Sachs. At session lows, the Dow was down as much as 547.63 points, before paring back some of those losses.
*****
&gt; The sell-off was broad-based, with three stocks falling for every advancer at the New York Stock Exchange. At one point, there were only 10 S&amp;P 500 names in positive territory. The real estate and consumer discretionary sectors were the biggest laggards, down nearly 3% and 1.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Stocks fell this week in the wake of the Fed‚Äôs 50 basis point interest rate hike on Wednesday ‚Äî the highest rate in 15 years. The central bank said it would continue hiking rates through 2023 to 5.1%, a larger figure than previously expected.
*****
&gt; Following the policy update, the Dow dropped 142 points on Wednesday, plunged 764 points Thursday, and declined further on Friday.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúAt the beginning of the week, we had the hope, given the very soft CPI number, that we could expect the Fed, and maybe the other central banks of the world, to be less hawkish,‚Äù Bokeh Capital founder Kim Forrest said.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúBut because they didn‚Äôt, and they had some stern words for investors and consumers alike that they were really focused on getting inflation down quickly, that has taken away a lot of our hope for a soft landing,‚Äù Forrest added.

&gt; # Santa Claus Rally, Mid-December Low &amp; January Indicator Trifecta

&gt; Wall Street, MSM and social are abuzz with Santa Claus Rally chatter and hype this week, but everyone has it all wrong. I can see Yale‚Äôs big grin shining down on us as his famous indicator and catchphrase reverberate on The Street.

&gt; They argue their case for why the ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally‚Äù will or won‚Äôt come to town this year. But they miss the point. Yale Hirsch invented and named the Santa Claus Rally in 1972, published in the 1973 Almanac. Oh lord, it is still misunderstood. It‚Äôs not a trading strategy, it‚Äôs an indicator!

&gt; SCR is the short, sweet rally that runs from the last 5 trading days of the year to the first two trading days of the New Year. S&amp;P 500 posts an average gain of 1.3%. Failure to rally tends to precede bear markets or times when stocks could be purchased at lower prices later in the year.

&gt; To wit Yale‚Äôs famous line: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come To Broad And Wall.‚Äù (Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac 2023 p 118).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c6285b39d656e4d47a2825774f0ebca7/14d8e7b82ba5eca8-a9/s500x750/c2684ec719407200da72d1e590a56cbc11015917.jpg))**

&gt; The current situation is reminiscent of 1974. Midterm October low, December retest. Lots of dire news and conditions. The Fed is clearly done taking orders from Wall Street and Washington and is bent on halting inflation. Their quarterly dot plot ticked up and it looks like at least one more 50bps hike. It‚Äôs working, inflation is decelerating. Reality is we will have higher inflation and rates for a while.

&gt; But we have already been in a bear and likely a recession. Bear markets bottom before recessions end and bull markets start when The Street least expects and practically everyone is a bear right now. While it sure looks ugly out there, we contend the worst is behind and a nascent bull is trying to emerge.

&gt; Stocks tend to bottom here in mid-December ahead of the seasonally strong last half of the month, especially small caps ‚Äì what used to be the ‚ÄúJanuary Effect.‚Äù

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/abe551038af905961dbe224f3309291b/14d8e7b82ba5eca8-dd/s500x750/bf884d42dce190a9e6386a7bab4025a8131b2f8d.jpg))**

&gt; The results of the Santa Claus Rally along with the other two components of our ‚ÄúJanuary Indicator Trifecta,‚Äù the first five days of January and the full month January Barometer (also created by Yale Hirsch in 1972) will help solidify our outlook for next year.

&gt; When all three are up the S&amp;P 500 has been up 90% of the time, 28 of 31 years, with an average gain of 17.5%. When any of them are down the year‚Äôs results are reduced and when all three are down the S&amp;P was down 3 of 8 years with an average loss of -3.6% with bear markets in 1969 (-11.4%), 2000 (-10.1%) and 2008 (-38.5%), flat years in 1956 (2.6%), 1978 (1.1%) and 2005 (3.0%). Down Trifecta‚Äôs were followed by gains in 1982 (14.8%) and 2016 (9.5%).

&gt; Keep your eye on the SCR for signs of a new bull or continuing bear. Then watch for the rest of our ‚ÄúJanuary Indicator Trifecta‚Äù FFD and JB. When all 3 agree the market generally follows suit.

&gt; We are anticipating a SCR this year. Inflation is easing, the Fed is likely to be done with rate increases in Q1 and we also see supply chain constraints fading now that China is loosening its Covid-19 restrictions. Seasonally speaking, we are also in the middle of the historically strongest period for stocks, the ‚ÄúSweet Spot of the 4-Year Cycle,‚Äù Q4 of midterm years through Q2 of pre-election year.

&gt; # 5 Things To Know About Recessions And Bear Markets

&gt; ‚ÄúI am an optimist because I don‚Äôt see the point in being anything else.‚Äù Abraham Lincoln

&gt; With all the talk about a pending recession and stocks in a bear market, today, I wanted to share some more thoughts and stats on recessions and bear markets.

&gt; First things first, we do not currently anticipate a recession in 2023, which is quite opposite of the general consensus. You can read more about that here and here.

&gt; What exactly is a bear market? For the definition of a bear market, we are using the traditional definition, which is an index down 20% or more from the recent peak. Yes, there isn‚Äôt much difference between 19.8% and 20.0%, so we will also include some near bear markets as well, but when we say bear market, that is what we mean.

&gt; First, do all bear markets take place in a recession? Turns out they don‚Äôt, as stocks, indeed can have a bear market without a recession. The worst ever was the 34% bear during the Crash of 1987, which all took place without a recession.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-197-800x595.png))**

&gt; Second, taking things a step further, here we broke down the performance based on if the bear market took place in a recession or not. Take note; we did include some ‚Äònear bear markets‚Äô this time to get more instances. Plus, a near bear feels like a bear market if you are in it. What still amazes us about the table below is that the average bear market without a recession was 24%, and this recent bear was 25%. Assuming we avoid a recession and October was indeed low, this was right on the bullseye.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-264-800x361.png))**

&gt; Now take another look at the table above. The last few bear markets recovered quite quickly. In fact, the last three bear markets that didn‚Äôt have a recession recovered in four, four, and three months. Something to think about here, as stocks are two months off the October lows.

&gt; Third, this has been making the rounds lately and has been adding to some of the worries. Looking at all the bear markets that took place around a recession, not once did the bear market end before the recession started. In other words, if we are indeed headed for a recession in 2023, this could suggest that new lows may also be quite likely. Incredibly, bears don‚Äôt end for another nine months on average after the recession started, before they find their ultimate low. Again, we don‚Äôt see a recession, so this wouldn‚Äôt be the case now, but the data is quite compelling.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BearMarketEnds-800x332.png))**

&gt; Fourth, the month of October tends to be a bear-market killer. Most bears have met their end during the month of October, more than any other month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/OctoberEnds-800x338.png))**

&gt; Below, we break down those previous 17 bear (or near bear) markets. The bottom line six of them ended in October, and we think there‚Äôs a very good chance number seven just happened.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-632-800x455.png))**

&gt; Fifth and lastly, if October was indeed the bear market low, be open to the idea of higher prices over the coming two years. While not a predictor of future behavior, history shows the markets were up more than 40% a year off of the bear-market lows and up almost 60% two years off of them. During uncertain and volatile situations (like the ones that markets have treated us to in 2022), it can be hard to imagine a positive path forward, and all we see are the obstacles. Stepping back a bit can be a helpful reminder of the resiliency of the markets over the long term.

&gt; Dr. Seuss said, ‚ÄúSometimes the questions are complicated, and the answers are simple.‚Äù To me, bear markets can be confusing and complicated, but the answer has always been that they indeed do eventually end, and historically better times will come when they do.

&gt; # 2022 US Stock Market Snapshot

&gt; With just a couple more weeks left in the year, the S&amp;P is down 18.2% year-to-date, which is tracking for the worst year since the Financial Crisis in 2008. As shown below, we've seen huge monthly volatility throughout the year within an overall downtrend. If December's declines hold, we'll have seen a move of 3% or more in either direction in eleven of twelve months this year. September has (so far) been the worst month with a decline of 9.3%, while July was the best month with a gain of 9.1%. In terms of weekday performance, Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays have averaged declines this year, while Tuesdays and Wednesdays have averaged small gains.

&gt; # Energy Losing Its Grip

&gt; You know those scenes in the movies where a character finds themselves hanging off a bridge, and slowly their sweaty grip starts to loosen as a finger or two starts to slip? That's what the energy sector is going through right now. As oil prices have been under pressure over the last few months, energy stocks had been holding up relatively well as the S&amp;P 500 Energy sector hit a new cycle high exactly a month ago today. Since then, the sector has declined nearly 9% even as the S&amp;P 500 has moved higher. Last week, the sector broke below its 50-DMA for the first time in over two months before stabilizing this week. Since that break below the 50-DMA on 12/6, the sector has made multiple intraday attempts (including today) to get back above it, but each time the sector has sold off and finished off its intraday highs. When looking at a price chart, any time you see a security break below a key moving average and then make several unsuccessful attempts to get back above that level, it's often a sign of a momentum shift.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/121422-XLE.png))**

&gt; On a relative strength basis, the Energy sector is also toeing a key trendline. The chart below compares the relative strength of XLE to the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) over the last year. During that time, Energy's relative strength has been riding a trendline higher with bounces each time it kissed that level. The most recent example occurred this week, but at this point, the bounce has been meager. Energy stocks have been outperforming energy commodities in recent months, so it's only natural to see some mean reversion in the stocks as well, but with the sector already breaking below its 50-DMA, this is a key trendline to watch. If the sector's relative strength weakens further, the technical picture for the sector would weaken materially, which would be a development investors in just about every other sector wouldn't shed a tear for.

&gt; # The Monetary Policy Conversation is Going to Shift in 2023

&gt; First, the good news ‚Äì

&gt; * The Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate by 50 basis points (bps) to the 4.25-4.50% range ‚Äì a step down from the 75 bps rate hike pace they went with at the last four meetings. This was expected, but it‚Äôs always good to see confirmation.
&gt; * They also said that ‚Äúongoing rate increases will be necessary‚Äù and raised their estimate of the peak rate from 4.6% to 5.1% in 2023, which was not a big surprise. What‚Äôs important is that the end of the rate hike cycle is near. The estimate revisions are nowhere as large as what we had seen earlier this year. At the end of 2021, they estimated rates to peak at 2.1% and then continuously shifted those up by 0.6% ‚Äì 1% increments every three months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-2022-12-14-median-fed-funds-rate-expectation-600x800.png))**

&gt; The not-so-good news: They also provided revised estimates for the economy, which wasn‚Äôt great.

&gt; * They revised economic growth lower, from 1.2% to 0.5% (2023)
&gt; * They revised the unemployment rate higher, from 4.4% to 4.6% (about 1% point higher than where it is now)
&gt; * They revised core inflation higher, from 3.1% to 3.5% (2023)

&gt; While Fed Chair Powell was careful to say that they don‚Äôt believe these forecasts qualify as a recession, keep in mind that the U.S. has never experienced a 1% rise in the unemployment rate outside of a recession.

&gt; But if you notice, I said ‚Äúnot so good news‚Äù instead of ‚Äúbad news.‚Äù Powell pointed out that these are members‚Äô best estimates ‚Äúas of today,‚Äù but that could change as new data comes in. And we have plenty of data coming in. Before their March meeting (when they update the projections again), we have three more inflation reports, three employment reports, and an employment cost index report (which is a preferred gauge of wage growth).

&gt; If you look back at the previous chart, we‚Äôve seen significant shifts in rate expectations just over the course of this year. There‚Äôs no reason to think we won‚Äôt see more revisions if the data cooperates.

&gt; # The shift: From how fast and how high to how long
&gt; The conversation in 2022 revolved around inflation, which surged to the highest level since 1981. As a result, we saw the most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in four decades as the Federal Reserve (Fed) looked to get on top of inflation. The Fed‚Äôs singular focus was to ensure they did more than ‚Äúenough‚Äù to lower inflation. Consequently, the over-arching question on investors‚Äô minds across the year was how quickly the Fed would raise rates, and how high they would go.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-2022-12-14-fed-funds-target-rate-601x800.png))**

&gt; I believe that‚Äôs going to shift in 2023. Fed officials will likely start thinking about balance again: the risk of tightening too much vs. the risk of not doing enough. Powell mentioned this in comments he made a couple of weeks ago but didn‚Äôt mention it again in his post-FOMC meeting press conference. The omission was curious, more so because we just got a second consecutive inflation report that surprised us to the downside. All he said was that, while the report was encouraging, they need substantially more evidence to believe that inflation has turned a corner. And so, they‚Äôll keep rates ‚Äúsufficiently restrictive.‚Äù

&gt; I think it was probably more a matter of Fed officials not having enough time to digest the report and not revising estimates accordingly. But as I wrote, the prospects of softer inflation in 2023 look good. There is enough reason to believe that disinflation will kick in as we get into the backend of 2023, especially if energy prices don‚Äôt spike again and core goods prices continue to ease. Official rental inflation starts to reflect market rents (which are falling rapidly). All of which makes it likely that estimate revisions will happen.

&gt; So, the question for investors will also shift‚Äîfrom how fast and how high to how long and how long they will keep interest rates at an overly restrictive level. The conversation will revolve around how many months of soft inflation data they need to see and how soft it must be. This could obviously take some time since inflation is not going to go down in a straight line ‚Äì there may be fits and starts and false alarms, but the trend is clear.

&gt; # The risk of ‚Äútransitory‚Äù deflation
&gt; What will upset the apple cart is that the disinflation we see in goods prices and housing is deemed transitory by the Fed, and they maintain rates at an overly tight level. This is not an insignificant risk. Powell again mentioned core services inflation, excluding housing in his press conference. He tied it to wage growth and a tight labor market. This group includes personal care services, education, childcare costs, wireless services, insurance fees, etc. ‚Äì all captured in the light blue bar in the chart below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-2022-12-15-core-CPI-576x800.png))**

&gt; As you can see, the good news is that the light blue bar just made its lowest contribution to core inflation in four months. The risk is that the Fed looks past all of this. Instead, they use wage growth and other labor market metrics as their guiding light as they think about ‚Äúhow long to stay restrictive.‚Äù

&gt; I think the odds are weighted in favor of them moving lower once inflation starts to fall rapidly, though only by the end of 2023 at the earliest. Which is not as early and not as big cuts as the market currently expects.

&gt; # Is Anyone Bullish?

&gt; ‚ÄúThe future ain‚Äôt what it used to be.‚Äù Yogi Berra

&gt; We‚Äôve noticed a recent trend: nearly no one is looking for stocks to do much in 2023. As Yogi said many years ago, the future ain‚Äôt looking too good.

&gt; The general consensus is that the first half of next year could be very rough, with many banks and investment shops expecting stocks to go back to new lows. Here‚Äôs a tweet I did summarizing some of the recent calls.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-195-800x364.png))**

&gt; Adding to this, for one of the first times ever, Bloomberg data showed that Wall Street Strategists expect negative returns for the S&amp;P 500 next year. That just doesn‚Äôt happen, or it didn‚Äôt happen until now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-275.jpg))**

&gt; We‚Äôve also noticed a considerable spike in put volume over the past week, another way of showing how potentially worried the masses are currently. Then yesterday, I saw this headline, adding to the festive mood.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-361-800x228.png))**

&gt; Here are two more signs of near-historic levels of skepticism. First, the recent Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey showed a record low level of risk appetite. In other words, lower than the financial crisis and COVID.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-410.png))**

&gt; Second, our friends at TDAmeritrade have proprietary data showing retail investors near the lowest level of sentiment since April 2020. This is called the Investor Movement Index (IMX), which measures what investors are actually doing and how they are positioning in markets. Again, not a lot of excitement out there.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-581-800x523.png))**

&gt; There‚Äôs an old Wall Street adage that it is hard to get hurt falling out of a basement window, and we think that could be the case now. Our take is that an incredible amount of negativity is priced into markets currently, and any good news could continue the recent strength off the October lows. Or, as General Patton said, ‚ÄúIf everyone is thinking alike, somebody isn‚Äôt thinking.‚Äù

&gt; What could spark it? It‚Äôll likely be better trends in inflation, which could open the door for the Fed to turn slightly more dovish. Coupled with what we continue to believe is a healthy and robust consumer, the economy may likely avoid the recession that many are expecting. We discussed better trends in inflation here and here.

&gt; It is hard for us not to keep pointing out that it is extremely rare for stocks to fall two years in a row. The S&amp;P 500 was down two years in a row in ‚Äô73 and ‚Äô74 (one of the worst recessions ever), then three years after the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s, that‚Äôs it. Even during the financial crisis, stocks only fell in 2008 before a significant rebound in 2009.

&gt; As the table below shows, it pays not to drive the car looking at the rearview mirror, as what just happened likely won‚Äôt happen again. As every time stocks fell in a midterm year (likely where we land in 2022), they bounced back the following year each time and gained 25% on average. Now, to be clear, we aren‚Äôt saying stocks will gain 25% next year‚Ä¶ But we are saying it isn‚Äôt as crazy as it sounds.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/table-for-joey-800x375.png))**

&gt; Warren Buffett said, ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.‚Äù Things haven‚Äôt been good for investors this year, but there are many opportunities to plant some trees today and benefit from what we predict to be a surprisingly good year for investors in 2023.

&gt; # VIX Death Cross Historically Bullish for S&amp;P 500 over Next 2 Weeks

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/701d12ab931a8e09d896aca1743b79b8/45d979a75554c1bd-aa/s500x750/84cf1e777c0891ca4ee5224dedf9b08cf23f5650.jpg))**

&gt; On Friday December 9, a Death Cross appeared on a chart of CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). A Death Cross occurs when the 50 day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. When this happens to an individual stock or major index like S&amp;P 500 it is normally considered bearish. But since the VIX is designed to measure near-term market volatility the lower it goes the better the S&amp;P 500 usually performs. Thus, a VIX Death Cross can be a bullish indication.

&gt; Going back to 1990, including the most recent cross, there have been 36 VIX Death Crosses. The S&amp;P 500‚Äôs average performance 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the past 35 VIX Death Crosses have been plotted in the following chart. In the 30 trading days prior to the VIX Death Cross, S&amp;P 500 rose an average of 4.1%. This solid advance is what played a large role in the VIX Death Cross as a rising market is normally accompanied by falling volatility and a declining VIX. After the Death Cross, S&amp;P 500 continued to climb another 2.5% over the next 60 trading days.

&gt; Also included on the chart are the 35 VIX Golden Crosses. A Golden Cross is just the opposite of a Death Cross, the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average as VIX is rising. A VIX Golden Cross is not a good event for S&amp;P 500 as it has typically declined an average 2.4% before the VIX Golden Cross and failed to return to breakeven 60 trading days later.

&gt; In following tables, we present the S&amp;P 500 performance after past VIX Death Crosses and VIX Golden Crosses across various timeframes. Based upon average performance the near-term, 1-and 2-week S&amp;P 500 performance following a VIX Death Cross is better than a VIX Golden Cross, but by 1-month later and beyond the results are less clear. This would suggest that the current VIX Death Cross is likely bullish in the near-term, but not a great indication much beyond 2-weeks.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/StockMarket. :)","Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 19th, 2022",1671234316
1417,StockMarket,[removed],Super weird question,1671232982
1418,StockMarket,,This is war!,1671228465
1419,StockMarket,"
I don‚Äôt understand. In the past 10 years of trading, I‚Äôve never come across an easier market. Just buy daily puts and short SPY and APPL or any other stock you like and you end the day green. There is no way the market will go up anytime soon so we can repeat this process every single day for months to come and keep making money. No analysis needed no DD needed. For instance, last night I loaded on puts and I made $42k. Today I again loaded on puts to make even more on puts. There is no stop.

Why has recently market been so easy?

1420,StockMarket,[removed],Next week setups DXY - SPX - XAG,1671226732

1422,StockMarket,[removed],SEC toughens rule on insider trading,1671226040
1423,StockMarket," As always, this is my plan and I share it to get feedback or help others view the market in new ways. It is not meant as trade advice or ideas. *Note that this uses the futures, which are currently trading at a \~30 point premium to the SPX.* 

***Recap***: Unfortunately for US-based traders like myself, the big move below **3920** happened overnight and we missed the clean trend move. In yesterday‚Äôs plan, I said that *‚Äúlosing support at* ***3920*** *could be grounds for a bigger move down. This would represent a move into value from the week of 11/5/22, and would begin a retrace down the November 10th spike up on a well-received CPI number. Targets are* ***3879*** *and* ***3820***\*.‚Äù\*

The first target hit quickly in the extended hours and after a move up at the cash session open, we got a swift move down to **3879** again. In yesterday‚Äôs analysis section, I wrote that ‚Äúmoving below **3880** would mean that this flag structure has also begun to fail.‚Äù I should have brought this point into the Plan section, but forgot. Luckily, I was still ready to trade and went short there for a quick trade down. With a profitable week already locked in and quad witching today, this was my only trade, and I took very little out of it.

***Balance/Trend***: The market has trended down for the last three days and this could be the start of the next leg down in this market. On the weekly time frame, the market has now booked consecutive weeks down, too.

***Analysis***: The most important thing to note is the big rejection on the weekly chart, which shows a move down from resistance in the core trend channel from January. In the process, this also was a rejection of the 200 day moving average. The second most important structure is the technical break from the trend up since October on the daily chart. The market first broke down from the 200 day last week and back tested it this week, unable to close any days above it. Therefore, the core trend remains decidedly down.

The final thing of note is that the market today found support at **3875-80** before failing there. This is not only important for reasons mentioned above, but also because if the market had held above, it would mean that the bull flag I mentioned back in November was still holding.

***Plan***

* Staying below **3920** is broadly bearish, and this remains a pivot area as indicated yesterday
* If the market can recapture **3877-3880**, the I would be interested in going long, targeting **3915-20**
* If the market can show some strong buying above **3920**, I would also be interested in going long to target **3955-65**. Should there move continued buying above this level, I would add to the long side, targeting **3997**.
* If the market remains below **3871-79**, I am interested in shorts. Ideally, as usual, I‚Äôd like a show of force from sellers as indicated by volatility and volume, and delta too. Markets typically will repair these ‚Äúgaps‚Äù I mentioned, which extends to **3826** and next up would be my target of **3820** mentioned in the plan for today. Final target would be 11/5 weekly vPOC at **3816**.  

   * It‚Äôs hard trading with targets that are too big, but this move could extend quite a ways, and my final target could be as low as **3750**

1433,StockMarket,"An overvalued stock is a company whose value has been elevated beyond that of its fundamentals. There are many possible reasons for this to happen, such as investor optimism, speculation, or a lack of accurate information about the company's true financial health.

Several indicators may reveal that a stock is overvalued. For example, the company might be experiencing a decline in sales or profits, or it might have high levels of debt. Additionally, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share, may be significantly higher than the industry average.

Investors who buy overvalued stocks run the risk of having their shares plummet in value when the market realizes their true worth. Investors should do their homework and thoroughly investigate the company's finances and prospects before making any decisions to buy or sell.

It should also be noted that overvalued stocks can sometimes continue to rise in price for a long time because investors are still optimistic or some other factor is at play. However, this does not necessarily mean that the stock is a good investment, since it may eventually come back down to its true value.

In conclusion, overvalued stocks can be risky investments because they may not be accurately priced based on the company's financials. Before you buy or sell a stock, do your research and think things through carefully.

1444,StockMarket," The Al Bayt Stadium on the 15th saw how the Atlas Lions fought tooth and nail and lost the semi-finals to mighty France. They may have lost the match, but Morocco won our hearts!

The FIFA World Cup 2022 gave us some great underdog stories; Saudi Arabia defeating Messi‚Äôs Argentina, Japan bringing Germany to its knees, Ronaldo‚Äôs Portugal getting beaten by Tunisia and Morocco, Brazil getting beaten by Croatia‚Ä¶ and that unpredictability is the beauty of this game.

Like the World Cup, the markets have been a roller coaster ride this year with some less favoured stocks showing resilience and outperformance, like Croatia and Morocco.

Most investors pick stocks like football teams favouring Argentina, Brazil, France or Germany‚Äôs of the stock market- well known and popular. However, it is often the lesser-known ones that surprise everyone with their success. Finding those names is tougher, but often more rewarding.

Some InvestorAi picks include:

¬∑ **Sharda Cropchem Ltd**, in the Materials sector delivered a return of over 50% in the month to 11th Feb 2022

¬∑ **DB Corporation Limited**, in the Communication Services sector, delivered over 26% over a 30-day period to 27th Aug 2022

¬∑ **Karur Vysya Bank Ltd**, in the Financials sector, delivered over 40% returns in the month from 7th July 2022

Underdogs carry greater odds than the mainstream picks, but it‚Äôs harder to find the winners, so in the absence of being lucky, how do you identify them?

Fortunately, for markets, technology and massive amounts of data can help. Our [InvestorAi Equity](https://investorai.co.uk/equity/) app uses AI trained to look for breakout patterns to make investment predictions. As a machine, it lacks the human biases that we all have (like betting on your favorite team) and has the discipline to implement them (recognizing that it‚Äôs hard to come back from being two goals down.) It covers over 4500 global stocks and 1500 ETFs in 15 markets and performs over 800 million calculations every day, something that is impossible for a regular person to do. The proof is that it picked all the winners above and many more.

Whilst we will all be glued to our screens this Sunday eagerly to finally see who wins in the Lusail Stadium, we can‚Äôt wait to see who the surprise standouts of 2026 will be and hope that InvestorAi continues to spot the underdogs with great potential.

1445,StockMarket,"There are several reasons to¬†be bullish on the future of renewable energy industry in the United States: government support, market force, increasing demand, etc. But today, I want to highlight a latest news in technology: it is reported that the scientists with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory produced more energy than was consumed in a fusion reaction for the first time. In an experiment on 5 December, the lab‚Äôs National Ignition Facility (NIF) fusion reactor generated a power output of 3.15 megajoules from a laser power output of 2.05 megajoules ‚Äì a gain of around 150 per cent. However, this is far outweighed by the roughly 300 megajoules drawn from the electrical grid to power the lasers in the first place. This is a significant technology breakthrough in renewable energy ‚Äì maybe energy in general, which might have been changed forever because of this milestone. This is why the mere result of experiment, although have not been applied to any industrial usage, has intrigued global discussion and attention. 

What does it tell retail stock investors? If you‚Äôre sensitive enough to understand the importance of this news, then maybe it‚Äôs time to be bullish on renewable/alternative/clean energy stocks. Institution favorite blue chips and industry leaders are too crowded for retails investors, so it is important to find undiscovered small-cap stock, for example, Green Giant Inc. (GGE). This company came to my attention because of it has just entered the game ‚Äì a new executive is just appointed with a board that came from a real-estate background with enough capital and willingness to spend money and do something. I can‚Äôt help but notice the way they claim to operate in this new industry for them: they cooperate with companies that want to decarbonize and help them achieve that goal by sending experienced experts and technicians. At the same time, they will invest in renewable companies by leveraging financial resources.

Now the stock is basically unnoticed with low volume and very few press coverage. Sometimes it‚Äôs a good sigh when it comes to small caps because retail investors can only beat institutions by finding gems first.","A significant technology breakthrough in renewable energy, arousing public attention to renewable/alternative/clean energy stocks",1671205231

* Trump is launching his own NFT collection.
* The collection counts 45,000 NFTs, which are minted on Polygon and available for $99.
* Directly purchasing the trading cards on the website automatically enlists collectors into a sweepstakes game with thousands of prizes.

The former President of the United States announced on Truth Social the launch of his official digital trading card collection. The collection counts 45,000 NFTs, all of which feature Trump himself in a different attire‚Äîsuperman, spaceman, sheriff, stock market broker, golfer, etc. The President stated in his post that he intended for his fans and followers to view each of his cards ‚Äúvery much like a baseball card, but hopefully much more exciting.‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs NFTs are currently only purchasable for $99 each on his official website, though it shouldn‚Äôt take long for them to pop up on secondary markets such as Blur or OpenSea. The website makes it easy for non-crypto natives to buy the digital cards‚Äîfans only need an email address and a credit card, and the platform creates a crypto wallet for them. It‚Äôs also possible to buy the NFTs using MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet, and pay with wETH.¬†

Purchasers of Trump NFTs are automatically entered in a sweepstakes game, in which more than a thousand prizes will be distributed. Rewards include a dinner with Trump, a cocktail with him at Mar-a-Lago, a one-on-one meeting, the possibility of playing golf with him, a zoom call, and hand-signed memorabilia, among other things. Moreover, collectors are guaranteed a ticket at the Gala Dinner with Trump in Florida should they buy 45 cards.¬†

Trump fans also have the possibility of entering the sweepstakes without buying the trading cards. Sweepstakes entries are not tied to the digital cards themselves, meaning that collectors won‚Äôt be eligible for rewards if they buy the cards off of secondary markets. The website states that the money received through trading card sales would not be used to fund Trump‚Äôs political campaign.

Interestingly, the website calls the trading cards both ‚ÄúNFTs‚Äù and ‚Äúdigital collectibles‚Äù interchangeably. This is not the first time that a major brand uses ‚Äúdigital collectible‚Äù to describe the technology, since the word isn‚Äôt perceived quite so negatively by mainstream audiences as ‚ÄúNFTs.‚Äù Nevertheless, the website is careful to highlight that the cards are minted on Polygon, which it describes as eco-friendly and carbon neutral.¬†

I am holding DUK for several days. On Wednesday, it feels like everyone is expecting good news from the Fed, DUK has gone up to test the daily basis resistance. However bad news came out with Powell‚Äôs hawkish speech, the price has fallen to almost the open price. Yesterday, the market still hasn‚Äôt digested the Fed‚Äôs surprise and brought down DUK further. But I believe I am correct on the daily basis support at 101.81, because from 15 mins chart, DUK tried to reach that line and brought back in the afternoon trading hours.

Additionally, there is a trend support which is very close to the daily resistance. I think that‚Äôs a double support at around 101.5. Also, by looking at the economic calendar, I don‚Äôt think there will be any more terrible news coming out recently. Therefore, I believe the double support should be able to hold the price of DUK from falling, at least for short term.",DUK technical analysis,1671187607

\- Dot plot, market does not believe the fed.  They believe the Fed will cut rates sooner than projected.  Depending on when we see the fed cut is when we see the last drop for the market or around this time.  Sell off can take place starting before or after.  Recent history happened when fed levels rates like now.  Few months lining up with May/June peak based on the Fed watch tool is about the right timing in theory.

# PRINCIPAL SOLAR ANNOUNCES JOINT VENTURE WITH EXECUTIVE LOGISTICS &amp; TRANSPORTATION 

&amp;#x200B;

 

*Joint Venture Seeks to Expand ELT‚Äôs Current Reach into New Markets; Expand ELT‚Äôs Existing Vehicle Fleet, Convert Fleet Vehicles Using Principal Partner‚Äôs EV/Hybrid Technologies, and Generate Near-Term Revenue*

DALLAS, TEXAS, Dec. 15, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Principal Solar, Inc. (OTC Pink: PSWW) (‚ÄúPrincipal‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Company‚Äù), a strategic investor in organizations and technologies that support next- generation opportunities in traditional, renewable, and clean energy sectors as well as an investor in and operator of undervalued petroleum-producing properties, today announced that it has entered into a Joint Venture Agreement (the ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù) with Executive Logistics &amp; Transportation (‚ÄúELT‚Äù) for the purpose of expanding ELT‚Äôs existing logistics operations into new markets beyond its current activities in Tennessee and the Southeastern United States. Per the agreement, ELT will make an investment into Principal via a strategic restricted stock purchase, the proceeds from which are expected in part to fund the expansion of ELT‚Äôs existing fleet as well as the hybrid conversion of a portion of ELT‚Äôs fleet vehicles.

‚ÄúI believe this joint venture with ELT represents an exciting opportunity that leverages virtually all of Principal‚Äôs core strengths and stands to build positive forward momentum for both ELT and Principal,‚Äù said K. Bryce ‚ÄòRick‚Äô Toussaint, CEO and Chairman of Principal Solar. ‚ÄúOur primary goals for this Agreement are to generate near term revenue, expand ELT‚Äôs fleet and operations to take advantage of new market opportunities, and to gain ready access to a fleet of Class 8 trucks with the potential for future EV/Hybrid conversion with systems supplied by E Truck Transportation, one of Principal‚Äôs strategic investments. Along with our current minority investment in Double H Services LLC, we expect our venture with ELT to further expand our footprint into another region in the United States.‚Äù

Per the Agreement, Principal and ELT plan to launch business development initiatives intended to procure new logistics customers and contracts as well as to expand logistics services into new market sectors, with significant focus on the petroleum and concrete and aggregates industries.¬†ELT currently operates a fleet of approximately 30 Class 8 trucks and trailers, and the new joint venture is expected to facilitate an increase in fleet vehicle count as well as enable future EV and hybrid vehicle conversions.

Financial terms of the Agreement are expected to be disclosed at later date; however, due to its belief in the potential success of the new joint venture, ELT has already provided an initial tranche of working capital to Principal.

1517,StockMarket,"Elon Musk fan Cathie Wood seized a sizable chunk of Tesla stock (TSLA) late Wednesday after the stock extended a recent skid to its lowest level in more than two years.

ARK Invest, Wood‚Äôs investment management firm, snapped up 74,862 shares of the electric-vehicle maker across three of her exchange-traded funds, according to a daily transaction report sent via email. The purchase was valued around $11.7 million, based on Wednesday‚Äôs closing price of $156.80.

The snap-up by ARK also comes after Tesla's own chief executive officer Elon Musk sold approximately 21,995,000 shares of the company, or roughly $3.6 billion worth, during the three-day period ending Dec. 14, a regulatory filing showed after Wednesday's close.

ARK‚Äôs Tesla buy comprised 61,537 shares for the ARK Innovation fund (ARKK), 10,066 for the ARK Autonomous Tech. &amp; Robotics ETF (ARKQ), and 3,259 for the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW). Tesla is the third largest holding among ARK‚Äôs suite of investment products after Zoom Communications (ZM) and Exact Sciences (EXAS).

Wood's dip-buying spree comes during a difficult month amid a difficult year for Tesla as concerns intensify among investors that Musk as CEO diverted his attention away from the company to manage Twitter, the social media platform he recently acquired in a $44 billion take-private deal.

Tesla stock is down more than 19% in December so far and roughly 55% year-to-date. ARK's flagship ARK Innovation fund (ARKK) is down around 13% this month and 64% on the year.

(OTCQB:ILAL), (‚ÄúILAL‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), an international land investment and development firm, is pleased to announce the completion of Phase I of construction at its Oasis Park Resort, a 497-acre master planned community, located approximately eight kilometers south of the Company‚Äôs Rancho Costa Verde development, that offers breathtaking 180-degree sea and mountain views from every home site. ILAL has already pre-sold 75 of the 1,344 planned residential lots at Oasis Park Resort.*

*The completed Phase I development at Oasis Park Resort includes a two-mile main road from the highway to the Sea of Cortez as well as grading of the beach and marina. Phase II development is expected to commence in January 2023 and will include clubhouse and model home construction to facilitate onsite tours and sales. With home prices starting at $99,000, the Company‚Äôs Oasis Park Resort could ultimately generate over $30 million in gross lot sales and an additional $75 million in gross construction revenue. Home construction on pre-sold lots is expected to begin in Q1 2023.*

*Frank Ingrande, President of ILAL, commented, ‚ÄúAs announced earlier this week, we are seeing sales return to pre-COVID levels at our communities. With a boutique hotel, over 1,000 lot sales (at an average of $31,000 per lot) and nearly 100 homes built (at an average of $250,000 per home) to date at our 1,100-acre Rancho Costa Verde development, the timing to add Oasis and its unique natural amenities to our active portfolio could not be better. With zero debt on this property and the added boost from our planned mortgage division going into 2023, we expect sales from Oasis to have a significant impact on our operations in 2023 and beyond as we ramp sales and marketing efforts.‚Äù*

*****
&gt; Stock futures were sharply lower Thursday following the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest policy update, as investors worried the central bank could tip the economy into a recession as it continues its fight against inflation.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 350 points, or 1.05%. S&amp;P 500 futures dropped 1.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1.59%.
*****
&gt; Tesla shares fell more than 2% in the premarket after CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his stake in the company.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields declined following the most recent Fed rate hike, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling below 3.5%.
*****
&gt; Those moves follow a down session Wednesday when the Dow fell 142 points, while the S&amp;P 500 declined 0.61% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.76%.
*****
&gt; Investors digested the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest comments following a boost to its overnight borrowing rate. The central bank said it will continue hiking rates through 2023 and projected a higher-than-expected terminal rate of 5.1%. With Wednesday‚Äôs half a percentage point hike, the targeted range for rates is currently 4.25% to 4.5%, which is the highest in 15 years.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúOverall, we expected to hear Chair Powell emphasize that the ‚Äòhard part‚Äô of returning inflation to 2.0% is just beginning. We largely received that message,‚Äù Bank of America‚Äôs Michael Gapen wrote in a Wednesday note.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe Fed remains willing to risk a recession in the labor market in order to bring inflation down and, if anything, the December projections suggest that risk has risen, not diminished. We agree and continue to look for a recession in 1H 2023 and a sharper rise in the unemployment rate than the median FOMC member projects,‚Äù Gapen added.
*****
&gt; Despite favorable improvements like modest growth, spending and production, Powell indicated he remains concerned job gains are too robust and the unemployment rate is too good for the Fed‚Äôs fight against inflation.
*****
&gt; Investors will get another batch of economic data to digest Thursday. Retail sales, jobless claims and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index are all due out at 8:30 a.m. ET.

1549,StockMarket,"Seen a few posts today that confuse me. Do people not understand why the stock market exists?

The shares you are holding have value to you because they represent a portion of a company's earnings, but after they are sold the company don't really care that you get some of their money. Trust only exists because they might want to sell shares again in the future.

To the company/person selling shares, selling shares means the money in the present and helps them accomplish things. Its something that means to happen and is part of business, and you should start by selling things you deem overvalued. 

Now companies don't just sell shares when they go public, they also sell them when interest rates are high. Now because they need to, but because it's cheaper to sell shares than get a loan.

Debt and selling equity work in similar ways. Both take your future earnings in return for cash now. The difference is the debt you are forced to pay back, but equity can have almost 0 impacts until you issue something like a dividend.

When interest rates are low, borrowing is appealing, because you really want to hold onto equity, but when debt is high, selling equity is cheaper short term and makes more sense. You can always buy them back tax-free after making the money.

Expect a lot more companies to choose option b from now on.",Selling Shares is the Reason Stocks Go Public!,1671097934

* Fed funds rate set to a range of 4.25% - 4.5%, raised 50 bps as expected.
* Revised the projection of median terminal rates from 4.6% to 5.1%, or 5%-5.25% for a rate range at the end of 2023, no pivot will happen until 2024. For now, there is still 75 bps to reach the projected terminal rate.
* February rate hike will be based on incoming data.
* Powell is hawkish on the rate hikes, believing that more rate hikes are appropriate. Said the Fed will not cut the rate until they are confident about the inflation moving down to the target 2% in a sustained way, more evidence needed to stop the rate hike.

CEO‚Äôs sale of Tesla stock has weighed on the company‚Äôs share price, which is down more than 50% in 2022

&amp;#x200B;

By Rebecca Elliott

Updated Dec. 14, 2022 10:44 pm ET

&amp;#x200B;

Elon Musk sold more than $3.5 billion worth of Tesla Inc. stock this week in his second round of sales since buying Twitter Inc.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Musk sold nearly 22 million Tesla shares over a three-day period ending Dec. 14, according to a regulatory disclosure made public Wednesday.

&amp;#x200B;

This week‚Äôs sales mean the Tesla chief executive has sold more than $39 billion in Tesla shares since the company‚Äôs stock peaked in November 2021. Tesla, still the world‚Äôs most valued auto maker by value, has lost more than $700 billion in market capitalization since that all-time high.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn‚Äôt clear what prompted Mr. Musk to sell additional Tesla stock, and the company didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment. On Tuesday, however, Mr. Musk tweeted, ‚ÄúAt risk of stating obvious, beware of debt in turbulent macroeconomic conditions, especially when Fed keeps raising rates.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Musk‚Äôs ownership of Twitter, which the billionaire bought in a deal valued at $44 billion in October, has gotten off to a tumultuous start. Last month, Mr. Musk said Twitter had suffered ‚Äúa massive drop in revenue‚Äù and was losing $4 million a day. He later invoked the specter of bankruptcy.

&amp;#x200B;

As part of the acquisition, Twitter took on around $13 billion in debt. That could leave the social-media company owing annual interest payments of more than $1 billion, analysts have estimated, compared with around $51 million in 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Musk‚Äôs focus on Twitter has irritated some Tesla investors as the company tracks for its worst annual stock-price performance on record.

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla shares closed down 2.58% Wednesday at $156.80, the lowest level in more than two years. The company‚Äôs stock price decline of around 55% in 2022 has eclipsed that of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, which has fallen roughly 29% year-to-date.

&amp;#x200B;

It has also weighed on Mr. Musk‚Äôs personal wealth, which has declined by more than $100 billion this year to around $160 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. On Tuesday, Mr. Musk ceded the unofficial title of world‚Äôs richest person to European mogul Bernard Arnault.

&amp;#x200B;

The Tesla CEO previously sold company stock in April, August and November of this year, linking the latter two batches of sales to Twitter. This month‚Äôs sales leave Mr. Musk owning roughly 13.4% of Tesla, meaning he remains the company‚Äôs largest shareholder by far.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, selling stock could weaken his control over Tesla, which has a single class of shares. Companies including Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. have multiple classes of shares, giving founders supervoting power over common shareholders.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. Musk doesn‚Äôt accept a salary from Tesla and instead is compensated with stock awards. He also has used his Tesla holdings as collateral to secure personal debt.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to this year‚Äôs sales, Mr. Musk sold more than $16 billion of Tesla shares in November and December 2021. Much of that was earmarked to cover taxes associated with exercising vested stock options that would have expired this year.",Elon Musk Sold More Than $3.5 Billion Worth of Tesla Shares - Wall Street Journal,1671077704

In August 2022, Voyager revealed in a court filing that Alameda Research had borrowed $1.6 billion in crypto, representing 61% of Voyager‚Äôs loan book. If these loans were exposed, then it becomes SBF‚Äôs problem, so he wants to cover it up by posing his partial repayment of the loan as a bailout and completing the sale of Voyager and BlockFi with FTX equity.

SBF effectively bankrupted both Voyager and FTX. In the course of his attempt to cover his and his staff‚Äôs losses, SBF adversely affected the deposits of two sets of clients. Maybe, he knew he was in deep shit at that point, so he took out a massive loan using somebody else‚Äôs money (Voyager and its clients) as collateral to try and cover his own positions.¬†

1624,StockMarket,"The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against eight individuals in a $100 million securities fraud scheme in which they used the social media platforms Twitter and Discord to manipulate exchange-traded stocks.

According to the SEC, since at least January 2020, seven of the defendants promoted themselves as successful traders and cultivated hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter and in stock trading chatrooms on Discord. These seven defendants allegedly purchased certain stocks and then encouraged their substantial social media following to buy those selected stocks by posting price targets or indicating they were buying, holding, or adding to their stock positions. However, as the complaint alleges, when share prices and/or trading volumes rose in the promoted securities, the individuals regularly sold their shares without ever having disclosed their plans to dump the securities while they were promoting them.

""As our complaint states, the defendants used social media to amass a large following of novice investors and then took advantage of their followers by repeatedly feeding them a steady diet of misinformation, which resulted in fraudulent profits of approximately $100 million,"" said Joseph Sansone, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division‚Äôs Market Abuse Unit. ""Today‚Äôs action exposes the true motivation of these alleged fraudsters and serves as another warning that investors should be wary of unsolicited advice they encounter online.""

The following seven individuals were charged with securities fraud:

**Name - State of Residence - Twitter Handle**

1. Perry Matlock - Texas - PJ\_Matlock¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†
2. Edward Constantin - Texas - MrZackMorris
3. Thomas Cooperman - California - ohheytommy
4. Gary Deel - California - notoriousalerts
5. Mitchell Hennessey - New Jersey - Hugh\_Henne
6. Stefan Hrvatin - Florida - LadeBackk
7. John Rybarcyzk - Texas - Ultra\_Calls

The complaint further charges Daniel Knight (Twitter Handle: DipDeity), of Texas, with aiding and abetting the alleged scheme by, among other things, co-hosting a podcast in which he promoted many of the other individuals as expert traders and provided them with a forum for their manipulative statements. Knight also traded in concert with the other defendants and regularly generated profits from the manipulation.

1626,StockMarket,"Beta is a value that measures a security's volatility relative to the market as a whole. A stock with a beta value less than 1.00 is less volatile than the market. This can be appealing to investors who want to avoid the ups and downs or who are looking for more stable investments.

Low beta stocks can be a good choice for investors who are risk-averse or who have a conservative investment strategy. Because they are less likely to be affected by market movements, low beta stocks can provide a level of safety and predictability that may not be found in higher beta stocks.

Additionally, low beta stocks provide benefits of diversification to a portfolio. Because they have a lower correlation with the market, they can help to balance out the risks of other, more volatile investments in the portfolio.

Examples of stocks with low beta include utilities, consumer staples, and other companies that provide essential products. These companies typically have steady, predictable earnings and are less impacted by market fluctuations.

Investing in low beta stocks can be a wise way to provide stability to your portfolio. However, it's important to remember that all investments come with some risk and past performance is not a guarantee of future results. As with all investments, it's important to do your own research before making any decisions.

P.S: You can use our screeners to find low BETA stocks.

1628,StockMarket,"Binance Holdings Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao warned his colleagues to expect tough months ahead and said the firm will overcome current challenges, as the crypto billionaire tries to assuage concerns about the company‚Äôs financial health.

In a memo sent to staff, CZ, as the founder of the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange is known, said the industry for digital assets is going through ‚Äúa historic moment‚Äù and that Binance is in a strong financial position and ‚Äúwill survive any crypto winter.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhile we expect the next several months to be bumpy, we will get past this challenging period ‚Äì and we‚Äôll be stronger for having been through it,‚Äù he wrote in the memo seen by Bloomberg. He added that FTX‚Äôs recent collapse has brought with it ‚Äúa lot of extra scrutiny and tough questions‚Äù on his firm, referring to reports this week on customer withdrawals.

FTX‚Äôs shock collapse has rocked investor sentiment and prompted some traders to take control of their tokens, causing outflows at other exchanges. Binance was one of the exchanges hit by large outflows on Tuesday, which have since started to show signs of easing.

The memo and rebuttals on Twitter came on the back of a record number of net daily Bitcoin and Ether token outflows from Binance on Tuesday.

‚ÄúRest assured, this organization was built to last,‚Äù Zhao wrote in the memo.

*****

# [Stock futures are muted as investors await the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Wednesday as investors awaited the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest interest rate hike decision in its effort to crush inflation.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 2 points, or less than 0.1%. Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were also roughly flat.
*****
&gt; The Fed will conclude its December meeting and is expected to deliver a 50 basis-point rate hike. That‚Äôs a smaller bump after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes. A basis point is equal to one hundredth of one percent.
*****
&gt; Chair Jerome Powell will also speak Wednesday, giving further clues about what‚Äôs coming from the Fed in 2023. In previous meetings this year, traders have been sensitive to Powell‚Äôs language, interpreting his tone as hawkish or dovish.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWhile we expect the Fed to slow the pace of rate rises at its Wednesday meeting, policymakers are likely to stress that the job of curbing inflation is not yet over,‚Äù UBS‚Äô Mark Haefele wrote in a Wednesday note. ‚ÄúA slowing of job creation and wage growth will be needed before the Fed can stop hiking.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Stocks rose for a second day Tuesday, fueled by a cooler-than-anticipated inflation report. The November consumer price index was 7.1% on the year, less than the 7.3% gain expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The 0.1% increase from the previous month was also less than forecast.
*****
&gt; The signal that inflation may have peaked was positive for stocks as it means the Fed may be one step closer to halting interest rate hikes or switching to cuts, which would fuel equities.

If you‚Äôre looking to improve your trading performance, you may be tempted to add more indicators to your analysis. However, too many indicators can lead to clutter and confusion, and can actually have a negative impact on your trading performance. In this blog post, we‚Äôll look at how reducing the number of indicators you use can actually enhance your trading performance.

Understanding the Limitations of Indicators  
When it comes to trading, indicators are often not 100% reliable, as they may be based on past market data, and may not anticipate future trends or events. To identify false signals caused by a laggy trading tool, it is important to pay attention to discrepancies between expected outcomes and actual results. If the results of a trade are delayed or incorrect despite having followed signals that were generated via the trading tool, then this could be an indication that the tool is lagging. Other signs such as sudden changes in market trends, or false buy and sell signals may also indicate that a trading tool is lagging. It is important to monitor these indicators closely and make sure that the trading tool is working correctly before making any investment decisions.

Indicators can also suffer from lag, meaning they may not be useful in providing timely alerts when the market is volatile. This can manifest itself in false signals in the form of false positive trades or false negative trades. False positive trades happen when an indicator generates a signal to buy or sell, but the market acts contrary to what the indicator was predicting. False negative trades are when an indicator does not generate any signal despite a change in market conditions. A lagging indicator also has the potential to influence trader behavior and give false confidence if it is used without considering other factors. When trading with lagging indicators, it is important to consider multiple factors such as price action, volume and other technical indicators.  
üì∑  
Finally, traders should understand that indicators are meant to be used as a supplement to their own analysis and trading decisions and should not be relied on solely for making trading decisions Besides indicators being a helpful supplement, traders should be aware that indicators can also be lagging and cause traders to make decisions too late. If a trader fails to identify the indicators' lack of accuracy, they may unknowingly rely on indicators as the main decision-making tool, which can lead to costly trading mistakes. Therefore, indicators should be used in tandem with other forms of analysis and not as a stand-alone trading decision tool.

Why it can be Beneficial to Use Fewer Indicators  
Fewer indicators can help keep your trading decisions simpler and easier to understand. Markets can be unpredictable and having too many indicators can lead to laggy trading tools. As markets continuously evolve, it is important to select only the indicators that are reliable and reflect true market sentiment. Additionally, some indicators require a longer amount of time to show results while others provide instantaneous responses. When choosing indicators for markets, it is important to ensure that they are capable of providing meaningful information in a timely manner in order for your trading tool to perform optimally.

You will have more time to focus on analyzing the price action of the markets, instead of trying to decipher complicated trade signals when you use a high-performance trading tool. When markets become laggy or slow, there are various indicators that can alert you that your trading tool is not working optimally. Examples of these indicators include delays in the execution of orders, disconnection from the server, and frequent freezing. Fortunately, by using a reliable trading tool and keeping an eye out for such signals, you can maximize your chances of successful trades.

You will also be able to eliminate unnecessary noise from your charts, which can help you spot important trend reversals more quickly In conclusion, the laggy trading tool is a helpful tool for investors, helping to identify false signals and eliminate unnecessary noise from charts. This can help you ensure that you detect important trend reversals more quickly and accurately, which can help you make sound decisions about your trades.

Determining which Strategies Are the Most Effective  
Analyzing which strategies have the best returns over a certain period of time can help you determine which strategies are the most effective, especially when lagging is taken into account. If a trading tool appears to be lagging, it could be an indicator that the tool is not providing the most efficient steps for success. Comparing lagging activity with other strategies can give insight into why lagging is occurring and what steps can be taken to improve performance. By understanding lagging indicators and how it affects trading, investors can make informed decisions that ultimately result in more profitable investments.

Keeping track of the average profit or loss per trade is also important, as it can help you identify any potential losses or inefficiencies in your trading system. If your lagging trading tool consistently has lower profits than expected, it could indicate that the lagging indicator is not providing accurate results. It is important to monitor the lagging indicator to ensure that you are accurately interpreting market conditions and taking advantage of profitable trades. Additionally, if you find your lagging trading tool is lagging more than usual, this could be a sign that the parameters of your lagging indicator are no longer optimal and need to be adjusted. By monitoring your lagging indicators regularly, you can ensure that you are making profitable trades and avoiding losses due to lagging trading tools.

Utilizing a range of statistical indicators such as volatility, correlation, and moving averages can also be useful in determining which strategies are the most effective Meanwhile, utilizing a range of statistical indicators like volatility, correlation, and moving averages can be a helpful tool in determining which strategies are the most effective when dealing with lagging trading tools.

Developing Your Own Trading System  
Developing your own trading system requires a deep understanding of the markets and the ability to identify meaningful patterns. One of the most common tools used by traders to identify meaningful patterns are oscillators. Oscillators are mathematical calculations that oscillate between overbought and oversold levels to indicate when a market may be due for a reversal or a continuation. Oscillators can provide insight into the demand and supply which often provides an indication of where the price may go. Additionally, oscillators are often used in tandem with other technical analysis indicators, such as trend lines and support and resistance, to gain more confidence in trading decisions.

Backtesting is an important part of any trading system; it allows you to assess the performance of your strategy in the past and make tweaks for future success. One of the common indicators used for backtesting is oscillators, which are mathematical calculations that oscillate around a center line. Oscillators are used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in a market and signal potential trading opportunities. They can also be used to identify divergences, which indicate when momentum is slowing down or reversing its direction. By using oscillators during backtesting, traders can identify profitable trading opportunities and adjust their strategies accordingly.

You should also use indicators to measure volatility and risk, so that you can react quickly to changes in market conditions Meanwhile, indicators can be used to measure volatility and risk which is important in order to adapt quickly to changing market conditions. Making sure you have an indicators tool is essential in making sure your trading tool isn't laggy and that it responds quickly. Indicators can help you make the best decisions in order to help your trading tool remain responsive and successful.

Setting Clear Trading Goals and Objectives  
Setting clear trading goals and objectives is essential to help traders stay focused when trading with a laggy tool. A lagging trading tool can be indicative of a low refresh rate, causing the trader to miss out on potential opportunities. Furthermore, lagging tools often fail to provide the most up-dated and accurate trading data. To identify lagging tools, traders should be aware of any lags in order entries, speeds of market data updates, lags between verifying orders and lags between order routes. Additionally, lags in latency or response times can also cause lagging tools. To combat this issue, traders should look out for tools that have high refresh rates and low latency periods in order to ensure they are able to make well-informed decisions with the most accurate information available.

A trader should always have realistic goals and know exactly what they are trying to achieve with each trade. Traders should be aware of the lagging indicators that their trading tools might possess. These lagging tools can come in the form of lagging algorithms, lagging data points, lagged market information, or lagged signals. All of these lagging indicators can lead to unexpected losses or gains that can be difficult to counteract. As such, it is important for traders to have a clear understanding of their trading environment and the lagging indicators that might be present. By being aware of these lagging indicators, a trader can adjust their strategy accordingly and improve their chances of successful trading.

It is also important to set stop-loss and take-profit levels to ensure that losses are minimized and profits are maximized similarly, false signals from the trading tool can indicate a laggy platform and it is crucial to set stop-loss and take-profit levels in order to limit your losses and maximize your profits. Although false signals should be taken seriously, they can also be a result of market conditions that are outside of your control. It's important to understand all the risks involved in trading before making any decisions.

Monitoring Performance for Continuous Improvement  
Monitoring the performance of trading tools is essential to ensure they are running smoothly and efficiently. Common indicators of a laggy trading tool include slow response times when placing orders, freezing screens, and error messages. Additionally, if the tool is taking longer than expected to receive data from the market, it could be an indicator that there are performance issues. It is important to address these issues quickly so trading strategies are not impacted.

Regularly testing the latency and speed of the trading tool can identify any issues that need to be addressed before they become a problem. If the trading tool is not as fast as it should be, it could indicate a laggy response time. As most traders rely on quick execution of trades and decisions, any lags can be a hindrance to success. Signs of laggy performance include slower order execution, delayed price feeds, and a slow response time from the platform. If any of these indicators are present, it may be time to investigate further and consider if additional resources or changes are needed to improve the speed of the trading tool.

By carefully tracking performance metrics, it is possible to continuously improve the accuracy and reliability of the trading tool over time Additionally, it is important to keep a close eye on the performance metrics of the trading tool, as this can help to identify any areas of lag. Keeping track of key performance indicators such as latency and throughput provide an effective way to measure the accuracy and reliability of the trading tool over time. With careful monitoring, it is possible to reduce any lags and make sure that the user experience is smooth and seamless.

To Conclude  
In conclusion, reducing the number of indicators you use may be one of the best ways to enhance your performance as a trader. Too many indicators can lead to clutter and confusion and can actually have a negative impact on your trading performance. Focus on learning more about the indicators you already have and start to make sense of the data they provide for you.

1706,StockMarket,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially charged disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (aka SBF) with defrauding investors, it revealed on Tuesday morning following his arrest in the Bahamas. The SEC said in a press release that in addition to being charges with fraud regarding equity investors in FTX, he‚Äôs also being investigated regarding other securities law violations ‚Äî and noted that there are ongoing investigations pending against others involved as well.

The SEC isn‚Äôt the only one getting a hand on this ball, however: Both the Southern District of New York‚Äôs Attorney‚Äôs office and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also filed charges against SBF in ‚Äúparallel actions.‚Äù

The complaint from the U.S. securities regulator alleges that while Bankman-Fried presented FTX as ‚Äúa safe, responsible crypto asset trading platform,‚Äù in reality the founder sometimes described as ‚Äòcrypto‚Äôs white knight‚Äô was engaged in a ‚Äúyears-long fraud‚Äù designed to hide from FTX investors the fact that their funds were being redirected to SBF‚Äôs Alameda crypto hedge fund, while Alameda enjoyed a kind of favored status that protected it from the usual risk mitigation measures FTX employed. The SEC also takes issue with the degree of exposure FTX had to Alameda‚Äôs very large holdings of ‚Äúilliquid assets such as FTX-affiliated tokens.‚Äù

Also included in the complaint are allegations that FTX customer funds were employed via Alameda for other expenditures including VC investments, ‚Äúlavish real estate purchases,‚Äù and political donations, all of which have been documented in numerous reports and in some cases, by SBF‚Äôs own admission during his many interviews following the collapse of his businesses.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler reiterated his oft-repeated position that in fact, crypto trading platforms need to comply with existing securities laws in a quote in the release announcing the charges. This stands to be likely the most impactful and significant test of that position to date, since SBF‚Äôs specific charges in this action are allegations of violation of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. One consequence if SBF is convicted could be that he‚Äôs banned from future securities trading beyond as an individual, and prevented from acting as a corporate officer or board member, in addition to monetary penalties.

Soaring inflation and rate hikes have been investors' top concerns so far, and that's likely to continue to be the case, at least in the short term.

# [Stock futures rise as investors await key November inflation report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday as Wall Street braced for November‚Äôs key inflation report and the beginning of the Federal Reserve December policy meeting.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 197 points, or 0.57%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.53% and 0.55%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Investors are looking ahead to the release of November‚Äôs consumer price index report, and hoping for signs of easing inflation. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 0.3% increase on a monthly basis or an annual pace of 7.3%. That would be a step down from October‚Äôs 0.4% monthly increase and annual gain of 7.7%.
*****
&gt; Tuesday‚Äôs inflation report could play a key role in the Federal Reserve‚Äôs next rate-hiking decision expected at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are largely pricing in a 50 basis point increase, a slight decline from the previous four hikes. They will also monitor updated economic projections and commentary out of Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs press conference for signs of a potential policy pivot as fears of a recession linger on Wall Street.
*****
&gt; Monday‚Äôs overnight moves follow a solid session for all the major averages after a tough down week. The Dow gained more than 528 points, or 1.58%, while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq rose 1.43% and 1.26%, respectively.
*****
&gt; All S&amp;P 500 sectors finished with gains, led to the upside by energy stocks, which rose as oil prices gained.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think this is a reflection of what‚Äôs anticipated out of the CPI number tomorrow, and a hope that the Fed will confirm a 50 basis point raise on Wednesday,‚Äù said Kevin Philip, partner at Bel Air Investment Advisors.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think the market, as it‚Äôs done before, is banking, in my opinion, a little too heavily on some sort of Fed pivot and this bounce we got today is fragile at best.‚Äù

[ A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. ](https://preview.redd.it/wqdpnnwewn5a1.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=467fd39222648525d2b92ffd66c74fd303e41f26)

* The S&amp;P 500 could advance by 12% to 4,400 from current levels in 2023, Oppenheimer said Monday.¬†
* Stocks could find support from inflation easing after the Fed's aggressive campaign in raising borrowing costs.¬†
* China, meanwhile, holds both upside and downside risks for stocks next year.¬†

Stocks look ready to spring up by 12% in 2023, with support from cooling inflation and reopening prospects in China, but too much tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve poses downside risk, Oppenheimer said Monday.¬†

Adding its voice to the 2023 outlook for equities, the asset management firm set a target of 4,400 on the [S&amp;P 500](https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&amp;p_500?utm_medium=ingest&amp;utm_source=markets). The target represented nearly 12% upside from Friday's closing price of 3,934.38.¬†

Such a move would dig into the S&amp;P 500 likely loss for 2022, a year swayed largely by the Federal Reserve's fight against hot inflation centered on a fast pace of large interest rate increases. The 4,4400 level would, however, fall short of the index's all-time intraday high of 4,818.62 logged in early January.¬†

""Inflation stateside continuing to trend lower"" is among the factors contributing to Oppenheimer's target.¬†

""In our view the Federal Reserve's policy towards inflation implemented this year has begun to have a positive effect reducing the momentum that inflation has had since late 2021,"" wrote John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, in Monday's note.

""While we do not expect the Fed to pivot or pause a process of rate hikes anytime soon, we do expect that it will temper increases of its benchmark rate going forward should inflation come down further,"" he wrote.¬†

A step-down from four consecutive rate hikes of 75 basis points each may take place with Wednesday's policy decision from the Federal Open Market Committee. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has suggested that policy makers will slow the pace of increases to 50 basis points, which would put the fed funds rate at a range of 4.25% to 4%.¬†

Chinese policies could also play a role in pushing up the S&amp;P 500 next year, with expectations that China ""will have some success"" in reopening the world's second-largest economy by loosening its stringent zero-COVID policy. Cities across China have backed off some testing and quarantine requirements in the wake of mass domestic protests last month.¬†

China's zero-tolerance approach toward coronavirus infections has hurt the world's second-largest economy, said Stoltzfus. It has also ""delayed the process of addressing supply chain disruptions which have challenged the economies of China's trading partners around the world.""

Negative geopolitical developments from China as well as from Russia could contribute to knocking down stocks in 2023, the firm said. Negative implications and the impact on the global supply chain would include further COVID lockdowns in China, an incursion into Taiwan by Beijing, and a worsening outlook stemming from Russia's war in Ukraine. Oil production cuts by OPEC and its allies are also a downside risk factor, said Oppenheimer.¬†

The firm said its earnings projection of $230 for the S&amp;P 500 calls for a price-to-earnings multiple of 19x with near-flat earnings growth next year.¬†¬†

1721,StockMarket,"* Detention follows investigation into FTX implosion last month
* The Bahamas said on Monday that he faces extradition to the US

Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced co-founder of digital-asset exchange FTX, was arrested in the Bahamas after the US government filed a criminal indictment, following weeks of speculation that client funds were misused before his empire‚Äôs collapse.

Bankman-Fried is being held in custody pending an extradition process, the island nation‚Äôs attorney general, Ryan Pinder, said in a statement Monday. 

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan plan to unseal the case against him Tuesday morning, ‚Äúand will have more to say at that time,‚Äù Damian Williams, US attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a separate statement. He didn‚Äôt elaborate on the allegations.

The Securities and Exchange Commission separately authorized civil charges relating to Bankman-Fried‚Äôs violations of securities laws, Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal said in a statement. Those civil charges are expected to be filed publicly in Manhattan Tuesday, according to the statement. 

Bankman-Fried has been facing investigations in the US and the Bahamas, where FTX was headquartered, into a range of possible misconduct. One key inquiry has been whether customer funds were lent out to trading firm Alameda Research, which Bankman-Fried also founded. More than 100 FTX-related entities filed for US bankruptcy protections on Nov. 11. 

**‚ÄòPowerful Evidence‚Äô**

‚ÄúTo indict this early, when they didn‚Äôt have to, tells me that they have incredibly powerful evidence,‚Äù said Gene Rossi, a former federal prosecutor. Rossi added that prosecutors were probably ‚Äúgravely concerned‚Äù that Bankman-Fried would flee to a jurisdiction where he could not be extradited.

The White House declined to comment on the arrest and charges.

House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters told reporters the panel still plans to hold its hearing on FTX‚Äôs collapse. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important for the American public to understand FTX and what was going on,‚Äù she said.

Bankman-Fried, 30, is being held at the Cable Beach police station in Nassau, according to an officer working at the facility. The person, who declined to give a name when reached by phone, said that all the cells there are comfortable, but didn‚Äôt provide details.

The facility is about 13 miles from the Albany Bahamas luxury community where Bankman-Fried lives and is located close to a main tourist zone.

Bankman-Fried‚Äôs arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the matter. His attorney, Mark Cohen of Cohen &amp; Gresser, didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment outside normal business hours.

In media interviews since FTX‚Äôs collapse, Bankman-Fried has admitted major managerial missteps, but has also claimed that he never tried to commit fraud or break the law.

In his remarks prepared for the US House hearing that Bankman-Fried was scheduled to appear at on Tuesday, he offered a blunt assessment of his plight. 

‚ÄúI would like to start by formally stating under oath: I f‚Äî-ked up,‚Äù Bankman-Fried said in draft copy of his remarks obtained by Bloomberg News. 

He added that the company‚Äôs new managers, led by restructuring expert John J. Ray III, have repeatedly rebuffed his offers to help sift through the wreckage of the collapsed crypto empire. Ray, who‚Äôs now leading the company, hasn‚Äôt responded to five of his emails, he said. 

**Crypto Exchanges**

Prior to the arrest and long before his empire collapsed into bankruptcy, federal prosecutors in Manhattan had already been looking into FTX as part of broader sweep of exchanges and potential anti-money laundering violations under the Bank Secrecy Act.

The investigation, led by the Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit, took a different trajectory after FTX‚Äôs catastrophic implosion.

Prosecutors were closely examining whether hundreds of millions of dollars were improperly transferred to the Bahamas around the time of FTX‚Äôs Nov. 11 bankruptcy filing in Delaware, according to a person familiar with the matter.

They were also digging into whether FTX broke the law by transferring funds to Alameda Research, the bankrupt investment firm also founded by Bankman-Fried, Bloomberg reported previously.

Last week, prosecutors, the FBI, Department of Justice officials and FTX‚Äôs new CEO and restructuring expert Ray met at SDNY‚Äôs headquarters in downtown Manhattan. Potential charges were not discussed at that meeting, according to a person familiar with the conversation.

Talking about the key levels, I am currently holding DUK and I found one daily basis support at 96.56 because I see 4 lows at around that line (the blue circle), even though it was broken two times in recent two months, I think it should still be effective because prices stayed around there for several days while trying to breakout. 

I found another key level at 101.81 which is daily basis key level 1. It might not be as strong as the previous support, because I see only 2 lows and 1 high (the red circle) that the price gets successfully supported or resisted. 

Daily basis key level 2 is found at 105.80, because four green circles show that the price has a hard time either going beyond or below too much of the line. 

For now, the price has gone above the line yesterday, but so far, I cannot be sure the key level 1 has been broken, might need to wait for today to see if there will be a callback, maybe the CPI data will give me an idea about to hold or to sell.

Yesterday's low was near the previous intensive trading area which I think traders maybe like to long.

Plan: Long around $169.4, stop loss at $167.7, target to $173, risk-reward ratio is 1:2.

From 15-minutes chart, ZM broke the left high, short-term uptrend established.

Due to earnings, LULU drops sharply. It‚Äôs a hammer, support obtained near the 200 SMA. And LULU extended from 8&amp;21 equilibrium, I think it will be price correction.

Plan: Long around $326, stop loss at $321, target to $340, risk-reward ratio is 1:3.

If at opening stock price falls quickly below the stop loss or opens directly below the stop loss point, abandon the plan.

Many signs are pointing to September 2022 as a major turning point for precious metals as evidence is mounting that gold made a major low that month (8 year cycle low). If this was the case that means we‚Äôre in month 3 of a new long term (usually around 8 years). That means the advancing phase should last for years. For context, the 8 year cycle that likely just concluded in September 2022 rallied for 54 months from January 2016 to August 2022.

You can see a chart marking that last 8 year cycle low and the rally that ensued. If this is a new long term cycle that would mean years of upside ahead

We can‚Äôt be sure we will get a rally just as long this time but we can see from the chart the shortest 8 year rally we have had was 34 months. Again, we may be just on month 3 so let them sink in!

There are the 4 specific data points that suggest September 2022 was the 8 year cycle low for Gold. They are listed below along with a corresponding chart for each.¬†

The wonderful thing is we will be able to see if any of thee data points starts to move in the wrong direction telling us the thesis is wrong. These will serve as our guideposts to be sure the 8 year cycle low is behind us. We will continue to monitor these data points and update if there are significant changes.

**Our 4 Major Pieces of Evidence**

1. Bullish monthly swing low for Gold (and silver and GDX too!).

&amp;#x200B;

[Monthly chart of Gold showing the monthly swing lows that formed the foundations of a major cycle low. For the previous cycle bottom that happened by crossing above $1088.90.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Bearish monthly swing high for Gold to Silver ratio. Silver outperforms Gold in precious metals bull markets so seeing this ratio in a long term downtrend is very bullish.

&amp;#x200B;

Nigeria‚Äôs 60 Million Farmers via AFAN, and Through the Farmers of Ghana and Several Other Territories Expected to Come Online Soon, Tingo has Access to up to Several Billion Dollars Per Annum of Agricultural Produce for Export

&amp;#x200B;

As a leading center of international trade and the World‚Äôs No.1 Free Trade Zone, with its more than 21,000 member companies and $475 billion of commodity derivatives traded in 2021, the DMCC is regarded as the ideal partner to launch the Group‚Äôs commodities and export business. Agriculture is a particularly important commodity group for the DMCC, where the Middle East and North Africa (‚ÄúMENA‚Äù) region‚Äôs own considerable demand for food imports with its estimated population of 547 million (Source: Worldbank - 2020), has assisted in creating a thriving and fast-growing agricultural commodities market.

&amp;#x200B;

CEO comments: ‚ÄúThe considerable investment Tingo Mobile has made over the years in establishing strong relationships and infrastructure in Africa has allowed it to create a unique and exceptionally strong supply chain. With our Agri-FinTech platforms and products significantly impacting users‚Äô crop yields and increasing the amount of produce available for export, we are now able to empower our members further by offering them direct access to international markets.

&amp;#x200B;

Through this end-to-end, seed-to-sale model, and our ability to procure billions of dollars of agricultural produce through Nigeria and Ghana, we believe we will become a major global food exporter and completely dollarize our business from next year. It should also be noted that the significant growth in group revenues, which we expect to result from our commodity platform and export business, will in turn contribute to a significant increase in profitability.‚Äù

1824,StockMarket,"Like many other battery metals, nickel is staring at a looming supply shortage. Fourteen years of underinvestment is running headlong into surging demand from a rapidly electrifying world.

[Global Nickel Demand](https://preview.redd.it/fedp5wpsoh5a1.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=080294130d0e5f2c18fd957d9cc41a0dac3e70fe)

At the same time demand is exploding, mining capital spending is running at the same level as 12 years ago and forecasts call for continued cuts in spending.

&amp;#x200B;

[Global Mining CAPEX Forecast](https://preview.redd.it/ya8v51whth5a1.png?width=847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65aa9e6abba05b74e9e6508db26bc1e1ee6a5598)

Global producer Vale is racing to build a battery metals refining operation in Canada while also acknowledging the nickel industry will need to spend an additional $20bn this decade for supply to have any chance of meeting demand.

Even with strong fundamentals, an eye-opening gulf between performance of the commodity and the companies that mine nickel has emerged. So far in 2022 the price of nickel is up 54% while a basket of global nickel miners is down a whopping 40%.

An 94% spread in less than 12 months sends a powerful message about the disconnect between industry fundamentals (the commodity price) and investors expectations (the stock price).

[Nickel Price vs. Nickel Producer Prices](https://preview.redd.it/7o3j2hzoth5a1.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a41deb45d6576da2e090a70373287914d810cc42)

Interestingly, this relationship is not playing out in other commodity markets. Contrast nickel with oil where the price of the commodity is up 17% so far in 2022, while oil producer stocks are up 53%, an outperformance of 36% for the producers.

[Oil Price vs. Oil Performance \(YTD 2022\)](https://preview.redd.it/8p0r7jiuth5a1.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1561d164bfc25f9b3027429d1dca5b96c5367bcd)

Oil investors are clearly aware of the state of oil supply and are looking through short term volatility of the commodity.

Nickel producers in contrast are deeply unloved, even as the underlying commodity continues to rally and is still up 100% from pre-covid levels.

Nickel is facing the same supply shortage effecting battery metals and energy, yet investors are clearly focused on near term slowing economic growth and missing the big picture.

Historically producer stocks track the underlying commodity and large divergences always close.

A recent interview with Mark Selby, CEO of Canada Nickel (CVE:CNC) neatly explains the supply dynamics going on in the nickel market today:

[https://youtu.be/nM4PWTgf1JY](https://youtu.be/nM4PWTgf1JY)

The fact that the government of Indonesia reached out to Canada on forming a nickel OPEC-like cartel, tells us nickel rich territories expect nickel to gain even more strategic national importance across the world.

Indonesia is signaling it expects to have significant bargaining power for years to come as supply struggles to keep up with demand.

Indonesia barred exports of their nickel last year, which sparked an ongoing trade dispute with the European Union. Indonesia has moved from being a small player in the 90‚Äôs to producing almost half of the world‚Äôs nickel supply today.

**Canada will be a Key Player** 

Canada is already a major global player when it comes to the largest producing nickel mines. Three of the eight largest nickel producing properties are located in Canada. 

[https://youtu.be/FVbS9VY3feI](https://youtu.be/FVbS9VY3feI)

Global miners are already positioning for Canada to become a global battery metals hub with Vale announcing plans on Wednesday to split off its base metal assets (includes nickel) from the larger iron ore business. Vale understands the strategic value of battery metals as it relates to the company‚Äôs valuation.

As mentioned above Vale estimates ramping nickel production will require $20 billion of additional investments in exploration and production.

&amp;#x200B;

**Canada Nickel: Crawford Mine**

Canada has also been home to a number of significant exploration discoveries lately, the Crawford and Timmins Nickel districts in particular. Both located in Northeastern Ontario, these districts are home to discoveries that could rival the largest nickel sulfide operations globally.

Canada Nickel‚Äôs Crawford mine is estimated to contain 3.5 million tons of nickel, on par with the four largest nickel projects in the world.

[Largest Global Nickel Sulphide Projects by M&amp;I Resource](https://preview.redd.it/j9p6dk91rh5a1.png?width=872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1397d408e3be29c9c3ecc9955bcf0dcf8e552f04)

Canada Nickel is drilling additional properties as well and two recent drilling programs results in promising samples.

[Canada Nickel Property Map \(Reid &amp; Sothman Highlighted\)](https://preview.redd.it/lmwuahvbrh5a1.png?width=686&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c62f6accd6343d85a5d19c73566f6478c3702b3)

The company‚Äôs Reid asset has already confirmed a mineralized footprint that is 90% the size of the massive Crawford resource and there is still significant land to explore.

[Reid \(left\) Comparison to Crawford \(right\)](https://preview.redd.it/v2779panrh5a1.png?width=867&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7937b192fcb45045199fa20bc1a36ed6c34e4da3)

New holes at Reid encountered mineralized dunite with 0.29%-0.35% nickel content, competitive with other North American projects.

The Sothman property is 70km south of Timmins and also confirmed mineralization, meaning nickel was found in peridotite rock, though the final assays are not yet completed to confirm the detailed nickel content.

Next Canada Nickel will be drilling in an area of Sothman where prior drilling has found intervals greater than 1% nickel, compared to typical concentrations below 0.50% in the region.

Current production and exciting exploration results make it likely Canada will remain a top three nickel destination through this decade if not longer.

**Quebec Nickel: The Ducros Project**

Quebec Nickel (CNSX:QNI) is a company focused on exploring high-grade nickel-copper-platinum group element deposits in Quebec; they are starting with its 100%-owned Ducros property located in the eastern Abitibi Greenstone Belt.

[Ducros Project Map](https://preview.redd.it/zbxgfv5xrh5a1.png?width=887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00623a3f6b648ef8e2c69691bdbccd765cb463f3)

The Quebec based nickel explorer recently announced preliminary drill results at the company‚Äôs Ducros project with nickel content of 1.21%.

A 1.21% concentration is in line with some of the best recent discoveries around the world and is far higher than many recent discoveries in Canada with concentrations below 0.50%.

[Quebec Nickel Drill Sample](https://preview.redd.it/u1wwj7s2sh5a1.png?width=883&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df767ca033bc5b85a1ed4f738ecb22f649003c34)

**High ESG Score = More Investor Dollars**

Canada has an overwhelming emissions advantage over mines in Asia.

Developed government‚Äôs and investors are fixated on bringing down Co2 emissions. Most of the mining and refining done in Indonesia, China and Russia is powered by coal generated electricity vs the hydro and increasingly renewable nature of electricity in Canada.

The result is that future mines in Canada will potentially give off 90% less Co2/ton than Indonesia, the world‚Äôs largest nickel mining jurisdiction.

Investor dollars continue to flow into companies with low and falling emissions. Canada‚Äôs low emission nickel projects should have a lower cost of funding and will have an easier time funding projects than an equivalent mine in the east, an important competitive advantage.

**Summing up the Opportunity for Nickel**

The rapid adoption of electric vehicles and the rise of renewable energy, which requires battery storage to truly replace fossil fuels, are fueling unprecedented demand for nickel and other battery metals.

Investment in new supply is not keeping up with demand however. A new supercycle in nickel, which happens every 15 years or so is now upon us.

Most importantly, investors are focused on slowing economic growth in the short term instead of the multi-year opportunity over the long term.

# [Stock futures nudge higher to start the week with Fed meeting, key inflation data on deck](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/11/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close-live-updates.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were fractionally higher early Monday ahead of a week with several anticipated events in the ongoing fight against inflation.
*****
&gt; Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 50 points, or 0.15%. Those for the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 edged 0.2% and 0.26% higher, respectively.
*****
&gt; The move in futures comes as investors will be focused on inflation this week. On Tuesday, the November consumer price index will be released, and traders will be looking for a sign that inflation is slowing.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve has a two-day meeting starting the same day. The central bank is expected to announce another rate hike on Wednesday, though traders are anticipating a smaller move than in recent months.
*****
&gt; In addition to the expected rate hike, the Fed‚Äôs updated economic projections and Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs press conference could be key signals for what the central bank wants to do in the coming months.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúFinancial conditions have eased dramatically since the October CPI reading released last month, so the Fed will likely use the December FOMC meeting to walk those back,‚Äù said Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Wealth. ‚ÄúWe think the markets are too sanguine on rates after the first quarter and we expect Powell to take a more hawkish tone and for the dots to indicate higher rates for a longer period of time than what is currently being priced in by the futures markets.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a rocky week that saw all three major averages lose ground. The Dow fell 2.77% for its worst week since September. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 3.37%, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 3.99%.

1851,StockMarket,"For years, PREPA (Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority), a company that had financial records little better than FTX, was able to raise billions on Wall Street and investors took the plunge, against all sense. The deal was enticing, but the parties must have known that the public utility was insolvent. However, PREPA‚Äôs bonds were underwritten by reputable banks like Morgan Stanley and Barclay‚Äôs and they were triple tax-exempt, and investors could evade state, local, and federal taxes.¬†

Several of the hedge funds that invested in PREPA bonds are seasoned investors in distressed debt who already plied their trade in Greece and Argentina, as well as Detroit. Angelo Gordon &amp; Company notified investors in 2019 that its Puerto Rican bet had paid off, offering the strongest performance of any strategy the AG Super Fund employed.¬†

In addition, Oppenheimer Funds, Franklin Templeton Investments, Aurelius Management, Elliott Asset Management, Blue Mountain Capital, D.E. Shaw Galvanic Portfolios, Knighthead Capital, Marathon Asset Management, and Franklin mutual fund also sunk money into PREPA‚Äôs bonds, and they counted on Puerto Rico in general and PREPA, in particular, being unable to claim bankruptcy.¬†

As PREPA underwent privatization, a gaggle of politically connected American contractors got big contracts.¬†McKinsey came in early on to advise both FOMB and various contractors while the firm was invested in a hedge fund selling PREPA bonds.

Bondholders, many of them retirees looking for steady dividends, haven't been paid in 6 years.

1862,StockMarket,"The world economy is facing one of its worst years in three decades as the energy shocks unleashed by the war in Ukraine continue to reverberate, according to Bloomberg Economics.

In a new analysis, economist Scott Johnson forecasts growth of just 2.4% in 2023. That‚Äôs down from an estimated 3.2% this year and the lowest ‚Äî excluding the crisis years of 2009 and 2020 ‚Äî since 1993.

However, the headline figure is likely to mask diverging fortunes, with the euro area starting 2023 in recession and the US ending the year in one. By contrast, China is projected to expand more than 5%, boosted by a faster-than-expected end to its zero-tolerance Covid strategy and support for its crisis-hit property market.

Differences will also be on display when it comes to monetary policy after a year in which central banks ‚Äúdashed toward restrictive territory in a pack,‚Äù Johnson wrote.

‚ÄúIn the US, with wage gains set to keep inflation above target, we think the Fed is headed toward a terminal rate of 5%, and will stay there till 1Q2024. In the euro area, meanwhile, a more rapid decline in inflation will mean a lower terminal rate and the possibility of cuts at the end of 2023.‚Äù

In China, where authorities are torn between a desire to support the recovery and concern about the weakness of the currency, ‚Äúlimited‚Äù rate cuts are on the cards.

On Dec 9, the major U.S. stock indexes all closed lower. By the close, the Dow closed down 0.9%, the Nasdaq was down 0.7% and the S&amp;P 500 was down 0.73%.

.

It is interesting that SPY broke last Thursday‚Äôs low and closed 1 cent above it on last Friday. Basically SPY just went side-way for the last 3 trading days. Right now SPY formed an outside day on the daily chart and the SMA20 just turn flat.

.

QQQ was down 0.64% and it was relatively stronger than SPY on last Friday. It broke last Thursday‚Äôs high while held last Thursday‚Äôs low. The SMA20 also turned flat for QQQ on the daily chart.

.

The 10-year US Treasury yield fell 3.012% to 3.591%, compared with a yield spread of -76 basis points over the two-year note while VIX rose 4.2%. Brent crude closed up 0.17%. Spot gold closed up 0.46% at $1,797.34 an ounce. The dollar index was down 0.13%, closing at 105.94.

.

The latest PPI data released by The U.S. Department of Labor on Friday showed an annual rate of 7.4%, a slightly higher-than-expected increase of 7.2%. It also raised the value for October, just before the Fed's interest rate decision, which is in the midst of the fastest rate hike cycle since the 1980s. Based on last week's ISM report, the price index of goods purchased by factories fell to a two-and-a-half-year low in November, but the shift in consumption to the service sector means that overall inflation will remain high for some time.

From daily chart, it‚Äôs the Morning Star, and I think it will do price correction to 8&amp;21 MA. 

Plan: Long around $130, stop loss at $128.3, target to $135, risk-reward ratio is 1:3.

Plan: Short around $69.8, stop loss at $70.01, target to $68.6, risk-reward ratio is 1:6.

1941,StockMarket,"**JPM's Flows &amp; Liquidity Note does a deep dive on markets across the board.**

* One of the scenarios considered by JPMorgan economists for 2023 is scenario 3, where the Fed raises its policy rate to 6.5% after a pause at 5% until mid-year.
* This scenario is supported by strong credit creation, high cash balances by US households, and elevated corporate profitability.
* This scenario where the Fed's policy rate rises to 6.5% might be less damaging for markets than feared given the low starting levels of demand for bonds and equities.
* It is unlikely that the balance between bond demand and supply will deteriorate significantly in 2023.
* If the Fed raises its policy rate to 6.5%, the longer end of the yield curve is likely to rise by less, implying more pronounced inversion of the yield curve.
* This scenario would be negative for equities from a fundamental perspective, but equity demand indicators are at low levels, making it less likely for a big decline in demand to amplify the weak fundamental backdrop in 2023.
* The high nominal equity yield is cushioning equities against further upward surprises in the pricing of the Fed funds rate.
* The experience of the past seven months supports this thesis: while the peak in Fed pricing has risen by 200bp, the S&amp;P500 index is practically unchanged over the same period.

Who has the money to buy at these interest rates? Car prices are still on cloud 9. All my tech sector friends still have their cushy jobs and some bought 1 million $ homes in CA. My friends work at FAANG and tesla.

If you don‚Äôt look at stocks everything looks normal. There is still crazy price increase in rent, groceries etc. the home prices are not in decline at all. Assuming they went up by 30-40% a 5% correction doesn‚Äôt make a dent. 

I don‚Äôt see a recession right now. Nothing close to it. But why are stocks and tech sector falling? Am I missing something? Am I poor or the people around me too rich? I make 120k working in utilities sector.",Where is the recession? Why are people not scared? Am I missing something?,1670734997
1998,StockMarket," What JPM is expecting out of the week ahead, from their desk research:

&amp;#x200B;

* The FOMC is expected to raise the target range for the funds rate by 50bp to 4.25-4.5% next week.
* The median dot for ‚Äô23 is likely to be revised higher by 25bp to 4.875, but there is a risk of a 50bp increase to 5.125%.
* Similar upward revisions are expected for ‚Äô24 and ‚Äô25 median dots.
* The phrase ""ongoing increases"" in the interest rate guidance may need to be adjusted.
* Given Chair Powell‚Äôs preference for well-orchestrated meetings, these expectations are not too dependent on next Tuesday‚Äôs November CPI report.
* The November meeting minutes raised expectations that the Committee would downshift the size of the December rate hike to 50bp.
* Attention will turn to the dots, with particular emphasis on the median dot for ‚Äô23.
* The strength of the December jobs report could impact the size of the rate hike.
* The September dots had easing of 75bp in ‚Äô24 and 100bp in ‚Äô25.
* Powell‚Äôs remarks about keeping rates restrictive for some time may indicate a bias for less easing.
* The median growth forecast could dip below 1% next year.
* The unemployment projections will be revised up.
* Little change is expected in the inflation projections.
* The Committee may look for ways to balance any changes to guidance with hawkish revisions.",JPM FOMC Preview for Next Week - Synopsis of the Desk Note,1670727676

Recently I am looking at MCD, the chart is interesting. It‚Äôs obvious that buyers and sellers are having an intense clash in a narrow range between $275 and $269 from daily chart. Price remained within the range for over a month, this should not be a normal condition. I think MCD is trying to choose a direction, the thing that could break the power balance between buyers and sellers should be the Fed‚Äôs meetings next Wednesday. If the rate hike is 50 bps, more power on buyers, therefore a breakout above the price range. If the rate hike is 75 bps, more power on sellers, therefore a breakout below the price range.

2036,StockMarket,"Supply and demand trading is a fundamental aspect of economics that involves the analysis of the economic forces of supply and demand in order to identify potentially profitable trades in the financial markets. By understanding the factors that drive supply and demand, traders can better predict price movements and improve their trading performance.

&amp;#x200B;

At its core, supply and demand trading is based on the concept of price equilibrium, which is the point at which the quantity of a good or service that is being supplied is equal to the quantity that is being demanded. This point of equilibrium is determined by a variety of factors, including the availability of the good or service, the level of consumer demand, and the presence of any substitute goods or services.

&amp;#x200B;

When the supply of a good or service exceeds the demand, prices tend to fall. This is because there is an excess of the good or service available, and sellers must lower their prices in order to compete for buyers. On the other hand, when the demand for a good or service exceeds the supply, prices tend to rise. This is because there is a shortage of the good or service, and buyers are willing to pay a higher price in order to obtain it.

https://preview.redd.it/ye437stuv15a1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6d4b0bd7de717e8c0a817495f3bada5635df346

&amp;#x200B;

One of the key principles of supply and demand trading is the concept of support and resistance levels. These are prices at which the supply and demand of a good or service are in balance, and they act as barriers to further price movements. If the price of a good or service is approaching a support level, it is likely that there will be an increase in demand, as buyers are more likely to purchase the good or service at the lower price. Similarly, if the price of a good or service is approaching a resistance level, it is likely that there will be an increase in supply, as sellers are more likely to sell their goods or services at the higher price.

&amp;#x200B;

Traders can use support and resistance levels to make more informed trading decisions. For example, if the price of a good or service is approaching a support level, a trader might consider buying the good or service in anticipation of an increase in demand and a subsequent rise in price. Similarly, if the price of a good or service is approaching a resistance level, a trader might consider selling the good or service in anticipation of an increase in supply and a subsequent drop in price.

&amp;#x200B;

Another key concept in supply and demand trading is the relationship between price and volume. Volume is a measure of the number of units of a good or service that are traded over a given period of time. When the volume of a good or service increases, it can be a sign that there is a change in the balance of supply and demand. For example, if the volume of a good or service increases significantly, it may be a sign that there is an increase in demand, and the price of the good or service is likely to rise. On the other hand, if the volume of a good or service decreases significantly, it may be a sign that there is an increase in supply, and the price of the good or service is likely to fall.

&amp;#x200B;

Traders can use the relationship between price and volume to make more informed trading decisions. For example, if the price of a good or service is rising and the volume is increasing, it may be a sign that there is an increase in demand, and the trader might consider buying the good or service. On the other hand, if the price of a good or service is falling and the volume is decreasing, it may be a sign that there is an increase in supply, and the trader might consider selling the good or service.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to understanding the basic principles of supply and demand trading, traders can use a variety of technical analysis tools to help them make more informed trading decisions. These tools include chart patterns, trend lines and indicators such as moving averages and relative strength index (RSI). By using these tools, traders can identify potential support and resistance levels, as well as potential trend reversals, and make more informed trading decisions based on the analysis of historical data.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, a trader might use a chart pattern such as a head and shoulders pattern to identify a potential trend reversal. A head and shoulders pattern is a chart formation that consists of a high point (the left shoulder), a higher high point (the head), and a lower high point (the right shoulder). This pattern can be a sign that the trend is reversing, and the trader might consider selling the good or service if the price falls below the neckline (the line connecting the lows of the left and right shoulders).

&amp;#x200B;

Similarly, a trader might use a trend line to identify a potential support or resistance level. A trend line is a straight line that is drawn on a chart to connect a series of prices that are moving in the same direction. If the price of a good or service is approaching a trend line and is unable to break through it, it may be a sign of a potential support or resistance level, and the trader might consider buying or selling the good or service based on the direction of the trend.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to using technical analysis tools, traders can also use fundamental analysis to improve their supply and demand trading. Fundamental analysis involves analyzing the economic, political, and social factors that can affect the supply and demand of a good or service. This can include things like economic indicators, such as gross domestic product (GDP) and employment data, as well as political events, such as elections and changes in government policy.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if a country's GDP is growing, it may be a sign that there is an increase in demand for goods and services, and the prices of those goods and services may rise. On the other hand, if a country's GDP is declining, it may be a sign that there is a decrease in demand, and the prices of goods and services may fall. By analyzing economic indicators, traders can gain a better understanding of the underlying forces that are driving supply and demand, and make more informed trading decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

Political events can also have a significant impact on supply and demand. For example, if a country is experiencing political instability, it may be a sign that there is an increase in uncertainty, which can lead to a decrease in demand for goods and services. On the other hand, if a country is experiencing political stability, it may be a sign that there is an increase in confidence, which can lead to an increase in demand. By analyzing political events, traders can gain a better understanding of the potential impact on supply and demand, and make more informed trading decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to economic and political factors, social factors can also affect supply and demand. For example, if there is a change in consumer preferences, it can lead to a shift in the demand for certain goods and services. For instance, if consumers become more health-conscious, there may be an increase in demand for organic foods, and the prices of those foods may rise. On the other hand, if consumers become less interested in a particular type of product, the demand for that product may decrease, and the prices may fall. By analyzing social trends and consumer preferences, traders can gain a better understanding of the potential impact on supply and demand, and make more informed trading decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, supply and demand trading is a powerful tool that can help traders to better understand and predict price movements in the financial markets. By understanding the factors that drive supply and demand, and by using technical analysis tools to identify potential support and resistance levels and trend reversals, traders can make more informed trading decisions and improve their trading performance.

&amp;#x200B;

 

Some questions that a reader might consider when thinking about how they use supply and demand in their own trading are:

* What factors do you consider when analyzing the supply and demand of a good or service? Do you focus mainly on technical analysis, or do you also incorporate fundamental analysis into your analysis?
* How do you identify potential support and resistance levels, and how do you use those levels to make trading decisions?
* Do you use any specific tools or indicators to help you analyze the relationship between price and volume, and how do those tools impact your trading decisions?
* How do you incorporate economic, political, and social factors into your analysis of supply and demand, and how do those factors influence your trading decisions?
* How has your understanding and use of supply and demand trading impacted your trading performance?

Together, the Big Three (BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street) are the largest single shareholder in almost 90% of S&amp;P 500 companies, and the largest shareholder in 40% of all publicly listed firms in the United States.

# **Dow tumbles 300 points Friday, posts worst week since September - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks finished lower Friday, with all the major averages posting losses for the week as worries persisted over continued rate hikes.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 305.02 points, or 0.9%, to close at 33,476.46. The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 0.73% to end at 3,934.38, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7% to finish at 11,004.62.
*****
&gt; On a weekly basis, the Dow fell 2.77% to post its worst week since September. The S&amp;P tumbled 3.37%, while the Nasdaq dropped 3.99%.
*****
&gt; Friday‚Äôs moves came after November‚Äôs producer price index showed higher-than-expected wholesale prices, which rose 0.3% last month and 7.4% over the previous year. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, also topped expectations.
*****
&gt; Optimistic consumer sentiment data alleviated some fears, but attention remains laser-focused on next week‚Äôs busy economic calendar.
*****
&gt; Attention shifted toward the consumer price index due out Tuesday, which is expected to show whether inflation has receded. The Federal Reserve will likely deliver a 50 basis point hike at the end of its December meeting on Wednesday. While the increase would be smaller than the previous four hikes, concerns have mounted over whether the central bank can architect a soft landing and prevent a recession.
*****
&gt; Investors have long hoped for a pivot from the Fed‚Äôs aggressive tightening stance, but the data fails to support that desire, said Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our expectation that we really need to see inflation come down closer to the fed funds rate for the Fed to pause, and we still have quite a bit of delta between those numbers,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still a bit of work to be done on the inflation front to really see that as the reality.‚Äù

&gt; # Quarterly Options Expiration Historically Bullish

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/30804cd4212fb2f406ef46e31ae8248c/63e5a913c7477243-9f/s500x750/a5723d5045a0683344447e2721fb5996ef625828.jpg))**

&gt; In fact, the week of options expiration and the week after have the most bullish record of all quarterly option expirations (page 108, Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac 2022 &amp; 2023 Almanac). Since 1982, DJIA has advanced 30 times during December‚Äôs options expiration week with an average gain of 0.51%. S&amp;P 500 has a similar, although slightly softer record.

&gt; However, the record is not pristine. Last year, accelerating inflation metrics triggered concerns the Fed was behind the curve with monetary policy. In 2018, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly loss as the Fed remained hawkish and determined to raise interest rates even as economic growth was slowing and Treasury bond yields were falling. In 2011, Europe‚Äôs debt crisis derailed the market. In 2012, the threat of going over the fiscal cliff triggered a nearly 2% loss the week after.

&gt; Going into next week, the market‚Äôs bullish historical trends will be tested by the Fed and CPI. The Fed is widely anticipated to raise its rate by 0.5% to a new range of 4.25%-4.50%. Today‚Äôs slightly hotter than expected PPI raises the stakes slightly, but the trend of lower inflation does remain intact which suggests the Fed is likely to remain on the course.

&gt; # More Positive Signs for Inflation

&gt; There are many reasons stocks and bonds have had a rough year so far in 2022, and right at the top is the huge spike in inflation this year. With the latest ‚Äòmost important economic event of our lifetime‚Äô, aka the latest CPI data coming out on Tuesday, today we‚Äôll look at some continued better inflation trends we are seeing.

&gt; First up, the consumer price index was up more than 9% year-over-year in June but has since come back to 7.7%, and we expect the trend to continue lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-141-800x546.png))**

&gt; Prices paid for manufacturing have simply crashed lower. If people aren‚Äôt paying as much for stuff, there is a good chance they will be able to charge less. As the chart below shows, services prices have been more stubborn, but manufacturing is dropping at a record pace. It recently came in at 43, cut in half from March.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-2100-800x546.png))**

&gt; Shelter makes up about 40% of the core inflation basket, so this is a very big deal when it runs hot as it has for most of this year, but should it turn lower, it could be a nice tailwind. Although the government‚Äôs data showed that rental prices were recently up more than 7% over the past year, we are seeing private measures of rents slowing down considerably, with the Apartment List nation rent report down a record 1% last month, on the heels of the previous record of 0.8% set the month before.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-334.png))**

&gt; Apartment List found that rents were up 17.6% last year but are up only 4.7% this year, and the trend remains firmly lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-4.png))**

&gt; Lastly, rents in 93 cities out of the 100 largest saw rents decline last month, so safe to say this is a widespread trend.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-5.png))**

&gt; Once again, government data lags behind private data, and the truth is that the government looks at existing and new leases, while private indices consider just new ones. Also, for the official data, rental units are sampled only every six months (given that rents aren‚Äôt re-negotiated very often). For this reason, we expect CPI rental measurements to lag private indices by about 8-12 months.

&gt; Additionally, Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index has dropped more than 1% back-to-back months for the first time in over a decade and has been lower three months in a row. Again, positive signs show that inflation is coming back to earth.

&gt; Lastly, used car prices continue to sink. According to their data, the Manheim Used Car Index showed that used car prices have dropped a record six months in a row and are down year-over-year 14.2%, the largest decline ever. Given that used cars make up about 5% of headline inflation, this is another potential tailwind as we head into 2023. And similar to rent prices, the government‚Äôs data tends to be slow to get with the picture, so we expect these lower used car prices to begin to get into the government‚Äôs data more over the coming months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-6-800x377.png))**

&gt; Why does all of this matter? As quickly as inflation soared, we think it could come back down in 2023, and things like rents, prices paid, and used cars are all suggesting that much lower prices could be coming soon. This, of course, would give the Fed room to take the foot off the pedal and likely end rate hikes early next year.

&gt; # Sentiment Staves Off Lower Readings

&gt; Sentiment tipped over before the S&amp;P 500's rough start to December. Without the market giving investors any more reason to take a bullish stance, the latest sentiment data from the AAII showed that once again less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. This week's reading was actually slightly higher rising 0.2 percentage points to 24.7%, a reading in the middle of this year's range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120822-Sentiment-1.png))**

&gt; Although bullish sentiment was higher, bearish sentiment rose by more with the reading going from 40.4% to 41.8%. That is the highest level since November 10th. While bearish sentiment has remained in a relatively tight range just above 40% for the past four weeks, current readings are more muted than what had been observed throughout most of the past year when there have been plenty of readings above 50%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120822-Sentiment-2.png))**

&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to heavily favor bears with a 17.1 percentage point spread between bulls and bears. That extends the record streak of negative readings to 36 weeks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120822-Sentiment-3.png))**

&gt; While the AAII survey was overall little changed, other sentiment readings were a bit mixed. The NAAIM Exposure index dropped to the lowest reading in a month. Conversely, the Investors Intelligence survey saw bulls surge to the highest level since late August combined with the lowest reading in the percentage of respondents expecting a correction since June. Aggregating all of these readings points to sentiment taking a bit more pessimistic of a stance this week than what has been observed over the past month.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 (SPY) December Drop

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has struggled to pick a direction so far this morning but at least as of this writing, it is on pace to finish lower yet again. From a technical perspective, the index is at a cross roads having formed a wedge in the past couple of months. During the recent rally, SPY did manage to move back above its 200-DMA, but it couldn't quite get above the past year's downtrend line. After the streak of declines in the past week, it has returned to the bottom of the rough uptrend line that has been in place off the October lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120722-SPY-1.png))**

&gt; Again price action has been choppy so far today, and while further declines could result in a break down, it would also mark an impressive, but not exactly unheard of, streak of declines. As shown below, it would be the fifth daily decline in a row. From a historical perspective, that is not particularly rare with 65 other streaks of 5 days or more since SPY began trading. As recently as October and September, there were two streaks that even extended to 6 days long.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120722-SPY-2.png))**

&gt; What is more rare is for these streaks to start at the beginning of a new month. In fact, this month's 3.5% drop to start December is on pace to be the 20th worst start of a month for the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) since inception, and there have only been two other times in which all of the first five trading days of a month have seen declines: February 2002 and June 2011. As shown below, those streaks of declines actually came in what were the middle of periods of consolidation while the following few months went on to experience further downside. As for the actual size of the declines, both of those previous instances saw larger drops (roughly around 4.5%) than the 3.5% decline currently.

&gt; # Bonds Catch a Bid as Stocks Sink

&gt; US equity markets have gotten off to a very weak start to December with four consecutive declines to start the month (and futures on Wednesday pointing to a fifth straight day). As shown below, SPY and most other major US index ETFs are already down more than 3% MTD, with growth underperforming value by a bit. Energy (XLE) is down most of the US sector ETFs followed by Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Financials (XLF). Utilities (XLU) is down the least so far in December at just -0.50%.

&gt; International equity markets have held up a little better than the US. The All-World ex-US ETF (CWI) and the Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) are both down just 1.2% MTD, and the All-World ex-US ETF is now outperforming SPY on a YTD basis because of the recent divergence.

&gt; For most of the year heading into December, we saw the bond market fall in tandem with stocks, but recently as stocks have dropped, bonds have caught a bid. As shown in the bottom right corner of our ETF matrix below, Treasury ETFs of all durations are up on the month, with the 20+ Year Treasury (TLT) up the most at 4.35%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120722etf.png))**

&gt; The chart below of the year-to-date percentage change (total return) of the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) and the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) is a great way to highlight how closely stocks and bonds have tracked each other this year. So far this month, QQQ is down 3.98%, while TLT is up 4.35%, but this performance divergence over the last four days hardly shows up yet on the chart.

&gt; # Back-to-Back Monthly Surge Consolidating Gains

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/blog_20221207_SP_5per_streak_table.jpg))**

&gt; Chances are you have already heard about the S&amp;P 500 gaining more than 5% in October and November this year. We can confirm this feat is not all that common occurring only 11 times since 1950 including this year. The longest S&amp;P 500 streak of monthly gains in excess of 5% per month was in 1998 beginning in September with a 6.2% advance, followed by 8.0% in October, 5.9% in November and 5.6% in December for a total gain of 28.4% in four months. The most recent streak was respectable, up 13.79% in two months.

Based upon the Bull &amp; Bear Markets table on page 134 of the 2023 Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, all ten previous streaks occurred in bull markets. Streaks in 2020, 2009, 2002, 1998 and 1974 all occurred early in new bull markets. Performance after the previous 10 monthly streaks ended was broadly bullish, but choppy during the 1-month immediately following. The recent tough start of trading this month is consistent with the consolidation that followed past streaks and the more recent 21-year Seasonal Pattern for December.

Digging deeper into the data we have graphed the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the previous 10 streaks in the following chart. A typical calendar month has 21 trading days on average. We elected to set our reference point at the day the monthly streak ended. The sizable gain in the 30 trading days before is clear. What also becomes more visible is the tendency for the S&amp;P 500 to pause and consolidate those gains in the 15-20 trading days after the streak‚Äôs end. Following this period, the S&amp;P 500 historically resumed its march higher and was always higher 1-year after the streak ended.ail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù

&gt; # When does the Santa Claus Rally Start?

&gt; As we noted on the blog last week, December is historically a strong month for stocks, and we don‚Äôt expect 2022 to be any different. It is historically the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500 since 1950 (April and November are stronger) and third-best during a midterm year (with October and November better).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-1-copy-800x338.png))**

&gt; Here are some of the major takeaways from that blog:

&gt; * When stocks are down for the year heading into this month, December has been higher eight of the past nine times.

&gt; * Stocks have finished green in December for the past three years, the longest such streak since six in a row from 2008 to 2013.
Midterm years have been worse lately, down a record 9.1% last time (in 2018) but also down in 2014. At least we‚Äôve never seen stocks down three Decembers in a row during midterm years.

&gt; * When stocks are up in both October and November (which could be the case this year as long as we don‚Äôt see a massive drop today), the S&amp;P 500 doesn‚Äôt do quite as well in December, up 0.75% on average compared with the average December return of 1.54%, suggesting the prior months could be taking some of December‚Äôs historical strength.

&gt; * Lastly, only once in history has December been the worst month of the year for the S&amp;P 500. That was in 2018 when the Fed hiked rates one more time, and it caused massive selling, but this month is usually quite calm, and big drops are rare.

&gt; Taking things a step further, though, when does Santa come to town? One of the most well-known investment axioms is the ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally,‚Äù and most investors assume it just means that stocks do well all of December, but this isn‚Äôt the case. It turns out that most of the strength in December happens in the latter half of the month. It makes sense to me, given that this is when Santa comes.

As I draw on the chart, the past two days 5 mins moving gave a triangle narrowing pattern on the chart, along with higher lows, and lower highs. Its represents that market is ""negotiating"" buyers and sellers are stuggling can not reached consensus. If the SPX goes up and breakup 3950 level (as in red short line), the buyers might hold the lead. If the SPX goes down and breakdown 3920 (yesterday's low) then trend reversal comfirmed.

2190,StockMarket," Shares of Block (SQ -0.38%) climbed 12.8% in November, following a strong earnings announcement. However, it lost some of those gains later in the month as fintech stocks and cryptocurrencies hit a rough patch.  

Gross profit increased more than 50% for its Cash App segment. That's impressive progress for a consumer-facing platform that offers transfer, digital payment, and investment services. Slowing economic growth, inflation, and difficult capital markets are all challenges for Cash App, but that service has been resilient. 

 Square, Block's payment-processing and analytics platform, also reported an impressive 30% increase in gross profit. Square is popular among small- and medium-sized businesses that offer goods and services to consumers, so investors were justifiably concerned that difficult economic conditions would jeopardize the segment's operations. 

 Block has leaned heavily into the disruptive potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, which founder and CEO Jack Dorsey believes will transform fintech. That might prove to be a shrewd long-term bet but is creating turbulence right now. 

 Block is down more than 60% year to date. It soared high in 2021, along with other growth stocks and cryptocurrency assets, but rising interest rates and dwindling investor risk appetite have fueled a serious collapse. Block's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is under 40, which is among the cheapest levels in its history. It might be too cheap for growth investors to ignore.  

The company has proven itself a fintech innovator multiple times. It has positioned itself to maintain a leadership role in every facet of next-generation finance for both consumers and small businesses. It has diversified revenue streams, and all of them seem to be growing quickly. Even if there are bumps in the road due to a weak economy over the next few months, this company is a strong candidate to deliver big returns for long-term investors.

Block could also be a compelling buy for investors who want crypto exposure but don't like the speculation involved in buying digital tokens outright. This stock is likely to rise if there's a crypto bull market, but it also has actual business fundamentals, regardless of speculation.",Shares of Block Rise 13% in November,1670473564

2240,StockMarket,"Oil fell for a fourth session as warnings from major US banks of a tough outlook for 2023 stoked concerns about the prospects for demand and dented appetite for risk assets including commodities.

West Texas Intermediate traded near $73 a barrel after futures sank almost 9% over the previous three sessions, as optimism surrounding China‚Äôs move to loosen strict virus curbs was tempered by data showing shrinking exports. Among the gloomy predictions, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said that he saw ‚Äúbumpy times ahead.‚Äù

Crude is limping into the end of the year, with the US benchmark heading for the first back-to-back quarterly drop since mid-2019 as central banks tighten monetary policy. Concerns about the global growth outlook, alongside a soft physical market and falling liquidity have weighed on prices, despite China‚Äôs easing of Covid-19 restrictions.

The latest leg down comes at a complex moment, with traders assessing the fall-out from Group of Seven curbs on Russian oil, including a price cap that‚Äôs meant to punish Moscow for the war in Ukraine.

‚ÄúThe geopolitical risk premium has all but disappeared, but inflation concerns have not,‚Äù PVM Oil Associates analysts Tamas Varga and Stephen Brennock said in a report. ‚ÄúClearly, investors are not worried the least about any potential supply shortage that might be the result of the price cap and the EU ban on Russian oil sales implemented two days ago.‚Äù

In response to the cap, which has been set at $60 a barrel, Russia is considering setting a price floor for its international oil sales. Moscow may either impose a fixed price for the nation‚Äôs barrels, or stipulate maximum discounts to international benchmarks at which they can be sold.

China eased a range of Covid restrictions on Wednesday, including allowing some home quarantine and scrapping certain test requirements. The world‚Äôs top crude importer was also said to be shifting focus to the economy, with a growth target of about 5% under consideration.

The American Petroleum Institute, meanwhile, reported that US stockpiles decreased by more than 6 million barrels last week, according to people familiar with the figures. Official inventories data follow later Wednesday.

# [Stock futures fall Wednesday as recession fears continue to batter market sentiment](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures slid Wednesday, with traders fretting over the possibility of a recession as the Federal Reserve could raise rates for longer than expected.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 142 points, or 0.4%, while S&amp;P 500 futures lost 0.6% and Nasdaq 100 futures traded lower by 1.1%.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off another tough session, with the Dow falling more than 350 points, or 1.03%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 1.4% and 2%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Investors have been losing hope that the Fed will be able to engineer a so-called soft landing that successfully tamps down inflation through higher rates and also avoids a recession. Instead, concerns are swirling around the state of the economy and the likelihood of a downturn in 2023.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúAll told, financial indicators point to a recession on the horizon,‚Äù wrote Wells Fargo‚Äôs Azhar Iqbal in a note to clients Wednesday. ‚ÄúThe S&amp;P 500 has peaked ahead of recessions with an average lead time of four months over the past few business cycles. Taken together with the inverted yield curve, markets are clearly braced for a recession in 2023.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Investors await more economic data this week for clues on what to expect from the Fed. Mortgage loan application data showed a decline last week despite a fall in rates.
*****
&gt; The tail end of earnings season continued with a solid report from Campbell Soup.

2271,StockMarket,"While the prospect of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates could spell another havoc for the bond market next year, the number of Treasury haters on Wall Street is slowly fading. Fund managers are starting to rebuild positions in the $24 trillion market on the belief that the highest bond interest income in more than a decade will offset the negative impact on portfolios of higher rates.

Morgan Stanley expects cross-asset income funds to find their best investment opportunities in dollar-denominated securities in nearly 20 years. The coupon rate on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds has reached 4.125%, the highest level since the global financial crisis.

Pimco believes that, as the biggest loser of the Fed‚Äôs tightening cycle, long-term U.S. treasury bonds will rebound in the future, because recession will stimulate investors to buy treasury bonds as a safe haven. In the traditional 60/40 investment portfolio, treasury bonds will once again become a reliable hedging tool.

In Minneapolis, Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates, told clients they could enjoy positive bond returns over the next 12 months. For the first time in 18 months, Doty has been so bullish on U.S. Treasuries, expecting U.S. Treasury returns of between 4 percent and 7 percent. He said, ""The coupon rate is much higher now, and the 2-year treasury bond rate is 4.5%, which has not been so high for many years.""

Still, it's far from smooth sailing for U.S. Treasury managers, as liquidity conditions remain troublesome, inflation threats linger, and long-dated Treasuries aren't cheap at all. Monday was one example, as bond yields surged after a stronger-than-expected U.S. ISM services index confirmed strong economic performance.

However, to be fair, for treasury bonds, an asset that has performed poorly for most of the post-epidemic era, sentiment has indeed improved.

Traders, strategists and economists see a modest rebound in bond prices as inflation cools, with the median 10-year yield forecast at 3.5% by the end of next year. The 2-year Treasury yield is expected to fall to 3.63%, and the Fed's policy rate is expected to be at 4.5%-4.75% by the end of next year.

Of course, investing in government bonds is obviously impossible to be foolproof, because from now until the end of 2023, inflation is expected to continue to be higher than the Fed's 2% target. John Ryding, chief economic adviser at Brean Capital, expects policy rates to peak at a higher-than-expected level of 5.25 percent and then remain on hold until the end of 2023.

To some, shying away from very short and very long-dated bonds appears to be the hottest safe trade in 2023 as the Federal Reserve's most aggressive rate hike in decades nears its peak.",Wall Street loves Treasuries again because the interest rate is so attractive,1670385903

2277,StockMarket,"According to a new survey released by the American polling company Gallup on Tuesday, most Americans (55%) believe that they are experiencing economic difficulties brought about by inflation, which is significantly higher than the 45% in the same period last year; in addition, 13% of the respondents said that the economic difficulties they faced had reached a very serious level.

&amp;#x200B;

Gallup first surveyed the impact of rising prices a year ago, when 45 percent of respondents said they were experiencing economic hardship. Two months later, that percentage rose slightly to 49%. According to the latest survey, 28% of low-income respondents said they had ""experienced severe financial difficulties"". Among middle-income respondents, 60 percent said they had ""experienced some form of financial hardship,"" up from less than 50 percent last year.

&amp;#x200B;

In contrast, high-income respondents were the least likely to be adversely affected by higher prices, but over time, the proportion who said they had ""experienced some form of financial hardship"" also increased from 28% in the previous year. rose to 42%.

&amp;#x200B;

The survey was conducted on the Gallup online platform from November 9th to 27th, and the survey was conducted among more than 1,800 American adults. Gallup found that in response to the effects of inflation, Americans generally cut back on spending, traveling and driving less.

&amp;#x200B;

Still, there are signs that inflation is easing, although prices are still higher than they were a year ago. Data from the U.S. Commerce Department showed personal spending rose 0.8% in October from the previous month. The sector's inflation gauge, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), rose 6% in October from a year earlier, a slowdown from September's 6.3% rise.

&amp;#x200B;

Data from US retail giant Wal-Mart also corroborates Gallup's report. Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on Tuesday that U.S. consumers are still under ""pressure"" from inflation and that many customers are having to save money.

&amp;#x200B;

McMillon pointed out that consumers have become more ""choosy"" when it comes to shopping, skipping some electronics and spending more on essentials. Consumers are buying cheaper proteins like hot dogs, beans and peanut butter over more expensive meats.",Poll: More than half of Americans are experiencing financial hardship from inflation,1670378625

2287,StockMarket,"Financial statements provide a snapshot of a company's financial health, allowing investors to make informed decisions about their investments. The three main types are the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.  


**Balance Sheet:**

The balance sheet is a financial statement that shows a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time.  


The balance sheet provides a comprehensive view of a company's financial position, allowing stakeholders to assess its overall health.  


**Income Statement:**

The income statement is a financial statement that shows a company's revenues, expenses, and net income over a specific period of time.  


The income statement provides a detailed look at the company's performance, allowing stakeholders to assess its profitability and sustainability.  


**Cash flow statement:**

The cash flow statement is a financial statement that shows a company's inflows and outflows of cash over a specific period of time.  


The cash flow statement provides a detailed look at the company's cash management, allowing stakeholders to assess its liquidity and financial stability.  


**Bottom line:**

It is important to review financial statements to make informed decisions. These documents provide valuable information about a company's financial position, performance, and stability, and can help stakeholders identify potential issues and opportunities for improvement. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to these three financial statements, there are several other types of financial statements that are relevant.

According to the source familiar with the matter, Ellison shared this data among a number of FTX staff members when she was experiencing a technical glitch with her personal trading account.

The document shows Ellison ostensibly had a negative balance at that time of around $1.31 billion in May 2022. All FTX accounts show negative balances, if the user has a negative balance for specific reasons such as that a payment wasn‚Äôt settled or the user was in debt from margin positions. The documentation that is allegedly tied to Ellison, shows an enormous balance that no ordinary user would have, including a negative quantity of FTX equity.

The document our newsdesk viewed indicates the user‚Äôs negative balance owed or held in a margin position, points to a massive amount of FTT, megaserum (MSRM), locked megaserum (MSRM), locked serum (SRM), locked maps (MAPS), solana (SOL), ethereum (ETH), bitcoin (BTC), and millions of dollars worth of stablecoins.

# [Stock futures are little changed after Monday‚Äôs rout](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Tuesday, as traders took a breather after fears of even higher rates sparked a sell-off during the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 20 points higher, or 0.06%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose marginally higher.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite led Monday‚Äôs downward charge, dropping 1.93% for its biggest one-day drop since Nov. 9. The S&amp;P 500 shed 1.79%, also notching its worst day in nearly a month. The Dow, meanwhile, lost 482 points, or 1.4%.
*****
&gt; Better-than-expected November ISM Services data, which looks at the purchasing level of manufacturers as a gauge the health of the broader economy, pressured equities Monday. The report stoked fears that the Federal Reserve will need to hike rates for longer than anticipated to bring down inflation. The release aligns with the payrolls report late last week in pointing to resilience within some areas of the economy.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is largely expecting a 50 basis point increase to interest rates at the Fed‚Äôs December meeting, but remain conflicted over how long the central bank‚Äôs interest rate hiking campaign will need to last, especially given the latest data.
*****
&gt; Despite this backdrop, markets could still move higher in the months ahead, even though slowing growth and higher rates will persist even into the new year, wrote Jason Draho, UBS‚Äô head of asset allocation, in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúA year-end rally may still be in the offing, though investors are likely to remain skittish until November CPI is released on the 13th and the FOMC meeting concludes on the 14th,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf there are no surprises with these events, momentum could continue.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Investors will look ahead to data Tuesday morning on international trade for insight into the strength of the U.S. and global economy. Later in the day, they will watch for post-bell earnings reports from Smith &amp; Wesson and Stitch Fix.

A combination of investors transitioning away from high-flying growth stocks, rising interest rates, and its own disappointing performance resulted in Block getting squashed. 

Yet that's throwing the baby out with the bathwater, which creates an opportunity for agile investors. Block has relied on its seller ecosystem as its primary growth vehicle for over a decade, but today it's a much more diverse tool for payments, making its severely discounted stock one that should be looked at more closely.  

Users are adopting the Cash App in droves, ending the third quarter with 49 million users and a record $52 billion of inflows. And just as Block itself has expanded its functionality over time, so has the Cash App ecosystem.

One of those extensions is with Block's Cash App Card, which is a free debit card that allows users to make transactions and withdraw the funds available in their Cash App account. There were nearly 18 million Cash App Card users in September, up more than 40% year over year, which now represents 35% of its total number of monthly active app users. On a weekly and daily basis, the number of actives using the card rose at an even faster rate. It shows Block has an increasingly important product that's popular with users and can create a critical mass of tens of millions of users over time.

Affected by both the ISM services PMI and the U.S. Department of Commerce's factory order data, U.S. stocks, which have been rising intermittently for a month and a half, weakened collectively on Monday. As of the close, the S&amp;P 500 index fell 1.79% to 3998.84 points; the Nasdaq index fell 1.93% to 11239.94 points; the Dow Jones index fell 1.40% to 33947.10 points.

On the one hand, the better-than-expected economic data has deepened the market's concerns about the Fed's more aggressive interest rate hikes. On the other hand, the continuous rise in the past few weeks has also accumulated adjustment pressure.

Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson suggested in a report on Monday that investors should be ""safe in pockets"" after the ""short-short turn-over"" scenario was staged earlier.

Wilson said that although the S&amp;P 500 index stood on the 200-day line last week, the downward trend from the beginning of the year has not changed, which also makes the risk-reward ratio of continuing to be bullish is not worthwhile. Wilson's change of stance also made him join the bearish camp of JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs peers. At the same time, even Deutsche Bank analyst Binky Chadha, who is optimistic that US stocks can stage a New Year's Eve market, also believes that the S&amp;P 500 index will not escape before it establishes an upward trend. plummeted.

Chinese concept stocks performed better than the broader market as a whole. After the Nasdaq China Golden Dragon Index rose more than 22% last week, it opened higher on the first trading day of this week and was dragged down by the broader market to dive, but closed down only 0.3%.

Popular Chinese concept stocks also rose and fell. Baidu rose 2.74%, Pinduoduo rose 1.69%, Ctrip rose 1.36%, and Alibaba rose 0.51%.","The three major U.S. stock indexes closed down, the Nasdaq fell nearly 2%, Tesla fell more than 6%",1670293658

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has warned that pension funds and other 'non-bank' financial firms now have more than $80 trillion of hidden, off-balance sheet dollar debt in the form of FX swaps. Having this much debt off the balance sheet, the BIS warns, leaves policymakers in a fog to avert the potentially disastrous effects of a global dollar squeeze. 

They saw funding squeezes during both the global financial crisis and again in March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic wrought havoc that required top central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve to intervene with dollar swap lines.

The **$80 trillion-plus ""hidden"" debt estimate exceeds the stocks of dollar Treasury bills, repo and commercial paper combined**, the BIS said, while the churn of deals was almost $5 trillion per day in April, two thirds of daily global FX turnover. For both non-U.S. banks and non-U.S. 'non-banks' such as pension funds, dollar obligations from FX swaps are now double their on-balance sheet dollar debt, it estimated.",BIS warns of $80 trillion of hidden FX swap debt,1670252047

On Dec 2, the three major U.S. stock indexes all closed lower. By the close, the Dow was up 0.10%, the Nasdaq was down 0.18% and the S&amp;P 500 was down 0.12%.

.

SPY gaped down on last Friday and closed near last Thursday‚Äôs closing price, which means the second day of time correction is established on the daily chart. The daily chart bull flag is still effective and last Friday‚Äôs low could be significant.

.

QQQ also gaped down last Friday, and on the daily chart, last Friday‚Äôs low could be a significant pivot point if the bull flag is effective.

.

The 10-year US Treasury yield dropped 0.428% to 3.49%, compared with a yield spread of -79 basis points over the two-year note while VIX was down 3.93%. Brent crude closed up 1.34%. Spot gold closed down 0.29% at $1,797.75 an ounce, its highest level since Aug 15. The dollar index was down 0.09%, closing at 104.5.

.

A seasonally adjusted 263,000 jobs were added in November, well above consensus forecasts of 200,000, ending three straight months of declines, and wage growth picked up from the previous month, suggesting the labor market remains very strong and the Fed will need to keep inflation in check. After the U.S. nonfarm data, gold fell more than $15 in the short term, the dollar index pulled up more than 100 points, and non-U.S. currencies generally fell. Job creation continued to rise despite growing signs of layoffs across the economy. Separately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday that the unemployment rate held steady at 3.7 % for the third month in a row. Wage growth has picked up, with average pay rising 5.1% over the past 12 months, below the rate of inflation but well above what the Fed would like to see as it tries to cool the economy.

AAPL‚Äôs KDJ golden cross on the daily chart is still effective and the SMA50 is about to be flat. Since 10/13, AAPL kept making lower highs and higher lows. However, in the next few days either buy side or the sell side will draw a conclusion on this battle.

The breakaway gap for PATH broke recent resistance and closed above it. The next resistance level will be around $15.50 and last Friday‚Äôs low, which is $13.92, may turn into a short-term support in the next few days.

**Opportunities**

1. Powell said a slower pace of rate increases would likely come at the December meeting. Meanwhile, inflation seems to cool down a bit and Fed‚Äôs minutes show a potential slower hike, it is time to look for undervalued technology stocks with solid ROE and high gross margin, which will benefit slower pace of rate hikes.

In addition, China is probably the only place that has a loose monetary policy that helps equities‚Äô valuations.

I realize this is a tricky question as some countries (like Germany) have a flat rate while others like the US have a more complicated system. I am trying to find out a ballpark figure of what the average investor pays in capital gains. Is it around 20%? More/less?

The reason why I am asking is because my country of residence does not impose said tax for stocks held for over 2 years‚Äô time. Dividend tax is also not imposed if I use accumulating ETFs. Because of this, I would assume that holding a broad market ETF and not paying any taxes on gains or reinvested dividends would beat results for 99% of investors who have this tax burden.

2434,StockMarket,"Is 1948 a better analog for the current economic conditions than 1980?

**Post-WWII US Economy**

* **Post-War rally and inflation spike:** following the war, millions of American soldiers returned home looking for work, the economy had to transition from war production to domestic consumption, *""Gross private investment rose by 223 percent in real terms, with a whopping six-fold real increase in residential- housing expenditures""* [2]. The initial response of the S&amp;P was to rally 24% in 9 months.
* **1946 inflation spike and market crash:** the combination of increased domestic spending and a rapidly growing workforce led to a spike in inflation from 2.1% to 14.8%. During this time, the S&amp;P crashed 26% and unemployment rose from 1.5% to 4.0%.
* **Post-War Bear Market:** the S&amp;P remained in a bear market for 2.5 years until bottoming in March 1948 (-28% from the post-War peak) while inflation slowly settled down to 6.8%.
* **Post-War Secular Bull Market:** with inflation seemingly under control and the labor market rebalanced, the economy took off again, this time rallying for nearly 5 years (from March 1948 to January 1953) with the S&amp;P gaining 93%.

My hypothesis is that the present environment in many ways reflects that of Post-WWII, specifically 1948. In terms of the labor market, spending, technological developments and inflation, I think this is a more appropriate analog than 1980. Take a look at the plots of S&amp;P earnings yields along-side the S&amp;P index below. You can see some similarities in both real earnings and S&amp;P price action.

Let me know what you think.

Many people in Western Europe and North America still think that global nuclear power generation is decreasing, but in fact year after year the global nuclear power generation increases.

&amp;#x200B;

**A. NEW REACTOR CONSTRUCTIONS:**

In the Western world we don't notice it yet, but a lot of new reactors are being build and planned for future construction starts as we speak.

[Source: World Nuclear Association](https://preview.redd.it/sju9655kio3a1.png?width=711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40f5336e7e2f2aa102905a33aaca79f3df8673d3)

[Source: World Nuclear Association](https://preview.redd.it/aanhuvkmio3a1.png?width=485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac18326d2a9929c27e24f53afacd40a1b1e3cc7e)

Many people think that nuclear reactors always take more than 10 years to build and go well over budget all the time.

But the reality is different.

Yes, the few new reactors build lately in the Western World went well over budget and over time, but the reactors build in China, India, UAE are build in 5-6 years time and close to budget.

[Source: IAEA](https://preview.redd.it/6xg3hmsbjo3a1.png?width=567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a01909acd274e1a75f7eb4da85f924dbe1e9c98)

Why that difference?

When building many reactors in Western World in 1970-1985 the USA, France, Canada, ... were in a kind of ""Assembly line work"" mode (Fleet mode construction) where different construction work groups went from one  construction site to the next construction site which made the construction more efficient.

Today China and India are in that same situation (fleet mode construction) as the Western World was 1970-1985, while the Western World lost that workforce with experience in constructing reactors.

[Source: World Nuclear Association](https://preview.redd.it/ms6cn60ejo3a1.png?width=648&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e4053a6de745a6b36f071e852a04fc961a08730)

By consequence the few new big reactors build in Europe and the USA at the moment take much more time, because the workforce/engineers has to reinvent that knowledge. That same workforce will become more and more efficient at future reactor constructions once again.

**Chinese big move on nuclear reactor build out**

Western world (USA, EU, South Korea, Japan) has an increasing supply security issue on different commodities, one of them is uranium.

Why?

China is significantly increasing their uranium consumption in coming years, while many western countries are making U-turn on the use of nuclear reactors by extending the operational licence of many existing reactors  (USA, Canada, France, ...) and pushing for new reactors constructions in  the future (a couple big reactors and a lot of SMR's)

The 150 additional big nuclear reactors that China aims to build from 2021  to 2035 will on their own increase the global uranium consumption by 30%.

Add to that the additional uranium demand from all the new future non-chinese reactors that are          being build at the moment and in the near future (India, Russian, Turkey, Egypt, ... USA (SMR's), Poland, ...)

But even uranium investors are seriously underestimating the uranium supply insecurity of China and the share of global uranium production that China will want to claim for themself for 200 Chinese reactors.

China wants to secure uranium:

1) for 150 new first cores (one new reactor core of a 1000MW reactor needs  \~1,450,000lb, one 1200MW reactor needs \~1,700,000lb U3O8)

https://preview.redd.it/dnrmcf2gjo3a1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5250e020e8d25becf1493de8acad0f8e353e33a

2) they need to renew old long term supply uranium contracts signed in 2005-2008 that are coming to their end at the moment.

3) to build up their own strategic reserve for their own energy security.

[Source: Kazatomprom presentation ](https://preview.redd.it/3p5w73bkjo3a1.png?width=1571&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19638626428870d49d634e205944a34dd1d74e0a)

1 ton U3O8 =  \~2204 lb U3O8 (uranium)

1 ton U = 2600 lb U3O8

=&gt; 23,000 tU = **\~60 million lb U3O8** only as a strategic reserve

Added to that the needed uranium:

\- for the new 150 chinese new cores (moste future reactors are 1200MW reactors) = 150 x \~1,700,000lb U3O8/ new core = **255 million lb U3O8**

\- annual consumption of the existing chinese reactors: one 1000MW reactor consumes \~450,000lb/year

**Compare this with the total global uranium production 2022 of \~135 million lb U3O8**

Soon Kazatomprom and Cameco :‚ÄúSorry western utility, we have less future uranium production available for you, China took more‚Äù

After Kazatomprom/Cameco/Orano, China is looking at Langer Heinrich (Paladin Energy, CNNC asked to restart the mine as fast as possible), Rossing  (buy all uranium instead of leaving a part for western utilities), Kayelekera (Lotus Energy), DASA (Global Atomic), ...

Global Atomic (GLO), Energy Fuels (UUUU), UR-Energy (URG), EnCore Energy (EU) and Paladin Energy (PDN) are signing uranium supply contracts with utilities as we speak

&amp;#x200B;

**India** is also increasing the number of reactors they are going to build the coming years

[Source: World Nuclear Association](https://preview.redd.it/58lr0fpojo3a1.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e761ab7bbec8903d5b17005baed05a7c1b5523d2)

Those ""2022?"" will probably be spread over 2023-2025, like UAE did (fleet mode construction): construction start of a couple in 2023, followed by a couple in 2024 and the last construction starts in 2025.

&amp;#x200B;

**B. MANY U-TURNS IN FAVOUR OF NUCLEAR ENERGY RECENTLY**

When Fukusihma nuclear accident happened all 54 Japanese reactors were shutdown in 2011-2013 and remained shutdown for many years. Today however, **Japan** made a big U-turn on that subject:

\- today 10 Japanese reactors are back in service

\- the japanese government wants to restart many other japanese reactors by Summer 2023 (I expect it will take a bit longer, so let's say by early Winter 2023): [https://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Japan-Plans-To-Restart-Seven-Nuclear-Reactors-By-Summer-2023.html](https://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Japan-Plans-To-Restart-Seven-Nuclear-Reactors-By-Summer-2023.html)

\- Japan wants to extend the operational licence of many japanese reactors (=&gt; additional unexpected uranium demand): [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-28/japan-studies-plan-to-extend-life-of-60-year-old-nuclear-plants?sref=z77yHwwS&amp;utm\_content=energy&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-energy&amp;utm\_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm\_medium=social&amp;utm\_source=twitter&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-28/japan-studies-plan-to-extend-life-of-60-year-old-nuclear-plants?sref=z77yHwwS&amp;utm_content=energy&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-energy&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall)

\- Japan wants to build new reactors

https://preview.redd.it/fcb3qtqtjo3a1.png?width=1020&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=12c2527812d171da21f28bcd0a682f46cffb304a

Building new reactors will take 10 years, you will say. But look what they want to do in following article:

[Source: John Quakes on twitter](https://preview.redd.it/h4xkixvujo3a1.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9ef93a9d08ef9c3de9611fe15826b913610ea7a)

Japan wants to replace reactors on existing nuclear plant sites while preserving the existing infrastructure of today. This will make the construction of a new working reactor much less longer. 

2 months ago Japan utilities met with Cameco to discuss their future uranium needs, because their uranium stockpile reached a critical low level, like in many other countries with nuclear reactors.

&amp;#x200B;

**South Korea** also made a U-turn recently: [https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?sc=30800028&amp;year=2022&amp;no=770043](https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?sc=30800028&amp;year=2022&amp;no=770043)

&amp;#x200B;

**USA** is putting everyting in place to support the future massive build out of SMR (Small Modular Reactors) in the USA, while extending the operational licence of existing reactors:

https://preview.redd.it/l4dqjauwjo3a1.png?width=1163&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b4b4bbb20372bdaa2b5abe30690b8021595f292

[https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-power-plant](https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-power-plant)

Other countries making a U-turn in favour of nuclear power are UK, FR, ...

**All the U-turns and announced operational licence extensions of existing reactors the last 4.5 months resulted in an ADDITIONAL \~10,000,000 lb  ANNUAL uranium demand compared to a total global uranium production of 135,000,000lb in 2022.**

Also: [https://www.brookfield.com/insights/new-dawn-nuclear-power](https://www.brookfield.com/insights/new-dawn-nuclear-power)

&amp;#x200B;

**C. THE GLOBAL URANIUM SUPPLY SIDE**

**In 2022 the global uranium production will only reach 135Mlbs.** And only with a significant higher uranium price in Q42022 than today (\~50USD/lb), the uranium sector could maybe reach 155Mlbs global production in 2023.

But the annual uranium demand in 2022, **before the \~10,500,000lb of unexpected additional ANNUAL uranium demand (July, August, September and October 2022 announcements)** is 190-200Mlbs (primary demand + first impact of overfeeding in 2022) **which reduces operational inventories** of producers, convertors and end-users (utilities).

=&gt; That's a defict of \~75Mlb in 2022 (200+10-135) and based on my estimates again a deficit of \~70Mlb in 2023 (200+15+10-155)

**Those operational inventories are now at a critical low level according to UxC (presentation in 1H2022), meaning that there isn't any room anymore to reduce operational inventories further.** So now utilities effectively need to find \~190Mlbs in the market! But where exactly?

Today the uranium spotprice is \~49USD/lb, **while the uranium sector needs 80USD/lb to increase production to be able to  get global uranium supply and demand in equilibrium again a couple         years after reaching those 80 USD/lb** (Due to further inflation, soon 90 USD/lb will be needed instead of 80 USD/lb)

Now comes the time that this will be translated in much higher upward pressure in the uranium market (This happens gradually, not overnight. I'm a long term investor)

And because the natural uranium cost only represents \~5% of total production cost of electricity from a nuclear reactor, utilities will not mind to  buy uranium above 100 USD/lb if needed, because the cost of shutting the reactor down due to fuel shortage will cost so much more for the utility than paying 2 times the uranium price of today

Explanation:

Total electricity production cost of electricity from nuclear reactor with 50USD/lb uranium price = 100

Total electricity production cost of electricity from nuclear reactor with 100USD/lb uranium price = 100+5=105

That's only an increase of 5% of total electricity production cost.

And in a couple years some existing uranium mines today will be depleted and will need replacement by new uranium mines. But those new uranium  mines need many years of construction and higher uranium prices than today.

**Conclusion:** The uranium price is about to increase significantly and due to the global risk off mode of investor on the global stockmarket at the moment the uranium mining companies have a big upside potential in coming months and couple years. And the market always anticipates.

**This isn't financial advice. Please do your own DD before investing.**

U.UN share price at 15.50 CAD/share represents an uranium price of \~45USD/lb.

[Source: John Quakes on twitter](https://preview.redd.it/6fkt5vx2ko3a1.png?width=771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=061cc4a3f52a50057b1f02e7abe9a9af7dcb6b0b)

While the uranium sector needs 80USD/lb to increase production to be able to get global uranium supply and demand in equilibrium again a couple years after reaching those 80 USD/lb.

And if the inflation remains high in 2023, soon 90 USD/lb will be needed instead of 80 USD/lb.

The needed 80 USD/lb and 90 USD/lb are based on:

\- the global production cost curve analysis compared to the global annual uranium consumption;

\- Cameco in May 2022: ""If the nuclear sector wants us to restart are US assets, than we will need 80 USD/lb uranium sell price""

\-  Amir, CEO of UEC, when uranium price was \~50 USD/lb said: ""Utilities need to pay much higher uranium prices for US production. -&gt; But those higher production cost uranium mines are needed to close the uranium supply gap! =&gt; If no significantly higher uranium prices  =&gt; no Uranium production =&gt; Not enough uranium for all utilities.

\-  Ben Finegold of Ocean Wall on October 7, 2022: ""Term contracting \~90-100 USD/lb"" ""We have seen break even prices as high as 90 USD/lb""

The new services that they started offering this year and for next year would be the Crypto Accept. Crypto Accept is payments with cryptocurrencies. They are also integrating now Crowd Ignition that they just acquired in early of this year. And focusing also on the future having ATM machines, Bitcoin mining and also lending to existing merchants. So that‚Äôs eVance Capital.

Basically, I think that OLB stock is totally undervalued. From their revenue, only about 3% right now is related to Bitcoin, 97% comes from the merchant service business, which is OLB's strongest most valuable piece of the business at this point. It‚Äôs growing, it‚Äôs growing organically. It‚Äôs a great business to be in. And that‚Äôs still the core business that they are doing right now. I am staying put to see OLB's earnings.

My main thesis is that Google is doomed, but beyond shorting GOOGL I'm curious how else to trade this theory.

Some high-level implications for AI language model domination (please add more):

1. Conversational search replaces current paradigm (Google Search / Bing no longer viable)
2. Writing related professions become easier / more productive
3. Coding related professions become easier / more productive (already seeing this a bit with coding AI assistants)
4. Educational feedback becomes easier (tutoring / homework more productive), flip side is plagiarism becomes easier
5. AI voice assistants (Alexa, Siri, Hey Google) more useful
6. Maybe some service industry effects? (e.g. place your McDonald's to-go order with an AI instead of a real person.)

Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal had expected an addition of 200,000 jobs.

Wages jumped 0.6% in November, double the expected pace.

Below are some initial reactions from economists and other analysts as U.S. stocks DJIA, -0.62% SPX, -0.97% traded lower and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 3.587% jumped following the data on nonfarm payrolls.

* ‚ÄúYou probably want to revise your view on inflation and it‚Äôs overall dynamic more based on today‚Äôs job report than any other data report this entire year. And not in a favorable direction,‚Äù said Jason Furman, economics professor at Harvard and former Obama White House economist.
* ‚ÄúA stronger than expected 263,000 monthly payroll print plus the spike in wages‚Ä¶will reinforce the Fed‚Äôs assessment that the labor market remains very overheated, and rates will need to go higher for longer in order to bring it back into balance,‚Äù said Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI.
* ‚ÄúThe Fed will not like the renewed strength in wages,‚Äù said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
* ‚ÄúThe U.S. labor market has lost some momentum this year, but it‚Äôs still speeding ahead as we approach the new year. Continue to underestimate the momentum in the U.S. labor market at your own peril. Job gains continue to be added at a pace that would have drawn cheers in 2019. The labor market might encounter some bumps in the road next year, but it‚Äôs heading into 2023 cruising,‚Äù said Nick Bunker, head of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab.

&gt;Apple‚Äôs iPhone 14 generation may fall 16 million units shy of expectations this year, as China‚Äôs Covid Zero policy roils its key Zhengzhou plant and entry-level models face weak demand, according to UBS.   
&gt;  
&gt;UBS analysts slashed their forecast of total iPhone 14 production to 76 million from 92 million units for the second half of 2022, a 20% fall from 2021. They attributed the lower expectations to both the manufacturing disruption faced by Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., and softening demand for lower-end iPhone 14 models. It‚Äôs one of the most bearish estimates about the current quarter and comes at a time of uncertainty about China‚Äôs potential relaxation of virus lockdown measures.

On Dec 1, the three major U.S. stock indexes closed mixed. By the close, the Dow was down 0.56%, the Nasdaq was up 0.13% and the S&amp;P 500 was down 0.09%.

.

Yesterday SPY closed around Wednesday‚Äôs closing price and experienced a time correction, though it is still extended on the upside. With relative low volume and the time correction, SPY may form another bull flag in the future, while we need a few more days to confirm the pattern.

.

QQQ also had a time correction on the daily chart and the long legged doji closed above Wednesday‚Äôs high. The downside level is $279.17 and the upside level is around $303.

.

The 10-year US Treasury yield dropped 3.762% to 3.51%, compared with a yield spread of -73 basis points over the two-year note while VIX was down 3.6%. Brent crude closed up 0.38%. Spot gold closed up 1.95% at $1,802.78 an ounce, its highest level since Aug 15. The dollar index was down 1.15%, closing at 104.72.

.

The US core PCE price index rose 0.2% in October, the smallest gain since July 2022, versus expectations of 0.30% and the previous increase of 0.50%. Expectations were lowered after the CPI, and the PCE report shows similar results. Core PCE growth of 0.2% month-on-month is ""in line"" with future inflation of 2-3%, a positive development even though it has only fallen to that level this month and was 0.5% month-on-month in September.

The bull flag we called out two weeks ago on NFLX is working out. Whoever longed the bull flag can kick some of your position in the next few days, since it is pretty extended on the daily chart. Although the KDJ golden cross is still effective, a correction in the next few days is unavoidable for NFLX.

2582,StockMarket," The U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba ended a historically strong month on a high note Wednesday, as the China-based e-commerce giant was swept up in the hope that the country will loosen its strict zero-COVID policy.

This stock has been in news articles/ online posts stating that Alibaba is good for long term investment and it can reach to new highs very soon.

**Alibaba's problems started in late 2020** when the Chinese government launched an antitrust probe into its e-commerce operations. That investigation culminated in a record fine of $2.8 billion the following April, as well as bans on its exclusive deals with merchants and tighter restrictions on its promotions, marketing campaigns, and investments.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Stock remains 75&amp;#37; below its all-time high of $317.14 from Oct. 2020 ](https://preview.redd.it/n7g8l4xfdf3a1.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78b574f86567c6eedbf5f780176b79972162d70d)

Few years back many articles prominently placed on the value proposition of Russian stocks, even after knowing that Russian authorities do not respect the rule of law. Experts used to say that market has already discounted that risk.

We saw what the outcome was sometime after Feb 24th, 2022 when almost all Russian stocks held abroad became effectively worthless.

Xi has publicly stated that his goal is to re-unite China. Why would we not believe him? Sources in the NSA say that the timeline has been accelerated. We know the Chinese Navy build out is very much keyed on Taiwan ""defense"" (invasion).

Investing in China is a terrible idea, unless of course you like to gamble. We should avoid countries that don't abide by the rule of law.

A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would result in western sanctions that would destroy any equity value of Chinese stocks, sure as happened with Russia.

Also, Alibaba might be a great investment if China's economy were still growing rapidly, its antitrust regulators were more relaxed, and its home government didn't repeatedly disrupt retailers with zero-COVID policies. But those problems all continue to cast dark clouds over Alibaba's future, and they make it tough to recommend buying the stock as a turnaround play.

2586,StockMarket,"Top U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley is cutting jobs globally as Wall Street comes under pressure from a slowdown in trading, Chief Executive James Gorman said on Dec. 1.

""Some people will be fired because of this, and we're doing some modest layoffs globally,"" Gorman said, noting that it was a collective decision by most businesses that have been in business for many years, but he did not disclose the number of layoffs. layoffs. layoffs.

Back in October, Gorman mentioned layoff preparations on a third-quarter earnings call. At the time, he said executives were reviewing headcount and layoffs could be imminent. ""You have to think about how much we've grown over the last few years and management is trying to make our operations more efficient.""

During the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the investment banking operations of Wall Street banks relied on market optimism to earn billions in advisory fees. But with the Federal Reserve entering the rate hike cycle this year, the investment bank carnival came to an abrupt end.

The three-quarter report released on October 14 showed that the bank‚Äôs transaction revenue for the quarter totaled US$4.64 billion, slightly lower than the average forecast of US$4.65 billion. Among them, the income of the investment banking department was US$1.28 billion, a year-on-year decrease of 55%. Shares of Morgan Stanley, down more than 20 percent this year, have now narrowed to 6 percent.

In addition to layoffs, Gorman also talked about Musk. Banks and other banks have previously provided financing support for Musk's acquisition of Twitter, but now the banking group will face high losses of up to hundreds of millions.

However, Gorman said he remains confident in the world's richest man.","Popular Chinese concept stocks generally fell on Thursday, and new energy auto stocks fell collectively",1669954046

2591,StockMarket,"Market pessimism is waning, according to Bank of America strategists led by Savita Subramanian. The bank's so-called sell-side indicator is understood to be within two percentage points of a buy signal, the closest it has been since 2017. In November, the index rose 56 basis points to 53.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 rose for a second straight month in the same period.

That may not actually be a good thing for stocks, as consensus equity allocation has long been a reliable contrarian indicator, Bank of America strategists wrote in a note Thursday. In other words, when Wall Street strategists are extremely bearish, it's a bullish sign, and vice versa.

In addition, the strategist noted that throughout the bull market of the 1980s and 1990s, as well as between 2009 and 2020, the market recommended underweight individual stocks.

Bank of America analysts said the indicator remains in neutral territory for now, with its forecast range below buy or sell thresholds. While the metric doesn't reflect every rise or fall in the stock market, it does have some historical predictive power for the S&amp;P 500's total return over the next 12 months.

In fact, according to a recent buy-side survey conducted by the bank, most expect a sell-off in the first half of 2023. Respondents said subdued inflation and a less hawkish central bank stance could turn the tide, but a pick-up was expected in the second half of the year.

It is worth mentioning that not only institutional investors have issued short-term warning signals, but JPMorgan strategists also said recently that the stock market will face more pain in the new year.","Bank of America: Market pessimism has weakened, but not a bullish signal",1669949983

""We thought that the economy and the business were going to go in a certain direction, and obviously it hasn't turned out that way,"" the boss of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp's parent company said. ""We've had to pull back.""

""Our operational focus over the next few years is going to be on efficiency and discipline and rigor, and just operating in a much tighter environment,"" Zuckerberg continued, adding that the US appears to be in better economic shape than Europe.

 **2. Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon** 

 ""This time last year, it looked like we were coming out of the pandemic,"" Jassy said. ""Then Omicron happened, and the war in Ukraine happened, and the inflationary environment that we're in happened, and now a very uncertain economy.""

Jassy, who succeeded Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as CEO last year, noted that shoppers are hungry for bargains and have been trading down to cheaper models of TVs and other electronics, against a backdrop of rising prices and borrowing costs.

""They're spending but they're being careful about trying to stretch their dollars,"" he said, adding that consumers gravitate to companies that treat them well in ""difficult and uncertain economies.""

Jassy said he plans to streamline Amazon's cost base without giving up on long-term bets that could pay off big for the e-commerce and cloud-computing titan.

 ""This next year or two, the economy is going to test the long-term resolve of a lot of companies,"" he said. 

**3. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock**

The Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates from near zero to about 4% this year in an effort to curb historic inflation. The US economy could face both higher rates and larger annual price increases for years to come, Fink said.

""We're going to have rates fundamentally higher, they're not going to go down,"" the BlackRock chief said, suggesting rates could stay around 2% to 3%, and inflation around 3% to 4%.

""At the same time, we're just not going to have an economy that is based on a real growth,"" he continued, pointing to Europe's energy crisis and China's slowing economy as current headwinds. ""We're going to enter a period of more what I would call malaise.""

Fink also highlighted the sharp declines in stocks and bonds this year, and the sharp rise in the US dollar, as evidence of a ""whole reset of the marketplace.""

Moreover, he noted that government debts have ballooned, and predicted it would take years for central banks to unwind all of the stimulus they've provided in recent years. That could mean they balk at stimulating their economies in the years ahead.

 **4. Janet Yellen, Treasury Secretary and former Federal Reserve chair** 

 ""The US economy is slowing down but it's operating at a very healthy level,"" Yellen said. ""Consumers remain in good shape, their finances are healthy. Banks are in a healthy state.""

* FXI sees one-day pop, $105 million flowed into fund on Nov. 30

Double-digit surges posted by a slew of China-focused funds had been met with muted interest in the early stages of the rally, as investors waited to see if the Asian nation would respond to domestic pressure to ease up on crippling Covid measures.

**But inflows have mounted in the past weeks, and bullish options activity on several of the ETFs is surging.**

**The $7.3 billion iShares MSCI China ETF (ticker** **MCHI**\*\*) has risen roughly 32% for the month of November and saw around $567 million of inflows.\*\* MCHI tracks the MSCI China Index, which measures the performance of major Chinese companies.¬†

**The $5.8 billion KraneShares CSI China Internet Fund (KWEB) has also climbed 48% in the past month with call volume rising to the highest level since June.** However, KWEB, which tracks an index that invests in publicly traded China-based companies whose primary business is the internet, has not seen significant inflows.¬†

 **‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòReal Pivot‚Äô in the market is China on Covid, not the Federal Reserve,‚Äù said Dave Lutz, head of ETFs at JonesTrading**. ‚ÄúFeels like KWEB was the primary vehicle guys were using to short China and it‚Äôs a decent cover bid along with real buying now. So, while there have been no net flows, under the surface there is a decent regime change.‚Äù¬†

Other funds including the $5 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI) and the $2 billion Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (ASHR) have edged higher by 34% and 17%, respectively, in November, with FXI seeing a one-day inflow of $105 million on Nov. 30, the most since March.

Investors, however, are slowly realizing that the road to a full re-opening -- which Goldman Sachs Group sees will happen around the middle of next year -- may be patchy.¬†

This may be why the **$158 million Direxion Daily FTSE China Bear 3X Shares (YANG), which aims to deliver three-times the inverse of the performance of the FTSE China 50 Index before fees and expenses, is seeing some inflows as well as call options, according to Rosenbluth.**

On Nov 30, the three major U.S. stock indexes surged late last night, with the Dow entering a technical bull market after Powell's comments boosted risk assets. By the close, the Dow was up 2.18%, the Nasdaq was up 4.41% and the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.09%.

.

SPY fully confirmed the daily chart bull flag and as we expected, Tuesday‚Äôs low is a new higher low on the short-term up-trend. The new green marubozu formed yesterday broke SMA200 and the resistance which was $403. Right now, SPY is extended on the daily chart so either price correction or time correction probably will appear in the next few days. As previous resistance normally turns into future support, $403 now is the significant level on the downside.

QQQ also had a breakout on its wedge and closed above 11/15‚Äôs high. Its now having the KDJ golden cross on its daily chart, while a little correction is reasonable in the next few days. Since it didn‚Äôt break Tuesday‚Äôs low, $279.17 is now the new support for QQQ.

On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered a speech on Inflation and the Labor Market. Mr. Powell said a slower pace of rate increases would likely come at the December meeting. Markets already had been pricing in a nearly 65% chance that the Fed would step down its interest rate increases to half of a percentage point in December, following four consecutive 75bps moves, according to CME Group. That pace of rate hikes is the most aggressive since the early 1980s. Following Powell‚Äôs speech, the probability for a half-point move rose to 77%.

2676,StockMarket,"But he warned that inflation remains too high and history shows that the FOMC cannot ease monetary policy too soon. U.S. bond yields and the U.S. dollar index collectively turned down. The two-year U.S. bond yield fell to 4.40% and fell more than 17 basis points from its daily high. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq stopped falling for three days, the Dow rose more than 300 points, and the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index expanded to more than 10%.

On Wednesday, November 30, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell delivered a speech entitled ""Inflation and the Labor Market"" at the think tank Brookings Institution. This was also his last public speech before the FOMC interest rate meeting on December 13-14.

&amp;#x200B;

Key points of the speech: Inflation is still too high, support to continue to raise interest rates, slow down interest rate hikes in December at the earliest, maintain interest rate restrictions for a period of time

&amp;#x200B;

In the speech, Powell admitted that ""U.S. inflation is still too high by any standard"" and that further interest rate hikes are needed. At the same time, it also makes sense to slow down the pace of rate hikes when interest rates are close to a level that is constrained enough to reduce inflation:

&amp;#x200B;

""The time to slow the pace of rate hikes may come as early as the December meeting. Given the progress the Fed has made in tightening policy, the timing of slowing rate hikes is far from the point where interest rates should peak in the future and remain at restrained levels. The duration is more important.

Restoring price stability, a bedrock of the economy and the Fed's mandate, may require keeping policy at growth-restricting levels for some time. Historical experience strongly warns against easing monetary policy prematurely. The Fed will stay the course until the job is done. ""

When talking about the inflation indicator released on Thursday and which is more important to the Fed: the personal consumption expenditure price index PCE in October, Powell said that it is expected that the nominal PCE will increase by 6% year-on-year, and the core PCE after deducting food and energy will increase by 5% year-on-year. The previous value has slightly cooled down:

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúWhile PCE inflation may have cooled more than expected, it‚Äôs still only one month‚Äôs worth of data, with the previous two months trending upwards unexpectedly. More evidence is needed to prove that inflation is actually falling.

Core inflation has hovered around 5% throughout 2022, unlike private sector forecasters who have said it will cool significantly over the past year. The truth is that the path ahead for inflation remains highly uncertain. ""

In view of this, Powell said that ""interest rates need to be raised to a sufficiently restrictive level for the economy to bring inflation back to the 2% target."" However, there is also ""considerable uncertainty"" about the terminal interest rate (that is, the peak interest rate) of this round of interest rate hike cycle. The peak interest rate will reach 4.6% next year.

&amp;#x200B;

Powell: Wage growth remains well above inflation target, labor supply gap is large, and price stability is a long way off

&amp;#x200B;

Powell then dismantled inflation into three parts: core commodity inflation, housing service inflation, and core service inflation other than housing. Housing services inflation, which is related to the rent-equivalent cost of owner-occupied dwellings, is still rising rapidly, while other core services inflation shows no clear trend.

&amp;#x200B;

He said that the year-on-year increase in core commodity inflation remained high at 4.6%, but it was down by nearly 3 percentage points from the beginning of the year. If the trend continues, it may exert downward pressure on overall inflation in the coming months. Housing services inflation was up 7.1% year-on-year and could keep rising until it eases later next year. Core services inflation, excluding housing, accounts for more than half of the core PCE index and is closely tied to the labor market.

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, the slowdown in labor demand and the rebalancing of wage growth have only shown the ""preliminary progress"" that the Fed hopes to see. Employment growth is still far exceeding the speed required to adapt to population growth. The number of job vacancies this year is still much higher than before the epidemic At any given time, there is still a significant shortage of labor, with employment still millions below where it was on the eve of the pandemic, and that supply shortage is unlikely to close anytime soon.

&amp;#x200B;

He pointed out that the current U.S. labor force gap is about 3.5 million people, reflecting lower-than-expected population growth and low labor force participation rates among the working-age population. Some workers have temporarily lost their labor force due to the infection of the new crown, and there is still ""over-retirement"" in the United States (that is, the number of retirees exceeds the expectations of the aging population itself). Over-retirement may account for more than 2 million of the 3.5 million labor force gap, and another 1.2 million The shortage comes from the sharp drop in net immigration and the surge in deaths during the epidemic. In the short term, it is necessary to continue to slow down the growth of labor demand to restore balance.

&amp;#x200B;

Referring to wage growth, Powell acknowledged that strong wage growth is a good thing, but that wage growth needs to be consistent with 2% inflation for it to be sustainable:

&amp;#x200B;

""Wage growth is also showing only tentative signs of rebalancing. Some indicators of wage growth have fallen recently, but so far the declines have been very modest relative to earlier gains, still leaving wage growth well above what is consistent with long-term 2% inflation rate at a level consistent with the

To sum up, Powell reiterated that it is appropriate to continue to raise interest rates, and it needs to raise interest rates to a ""sufficiently restrictive level"" for economic growth and maintain it at a stage high for ""a period of time"" in order to reduce inflation to the 2% target"" Desired Economic Environment‚Äù:

&amp;#x200B;

""Economic growth has slowed to levels well below its long-term trend, and this needs to continue. The bottleneck in commodity production is easing, and commodity price inflation appears to be easing, too, and this must continue. If rent inflation continues to decline, late next year At some point we may see housing services inflation start to decline. The labor market, which is particularly important for core services inflation excluding housing, shows only temporary signs of rebalancing, with wage growth still well above levels consistent with 2% inflation. To recover Prices are stable and there is still a long way to go.‚Äù","Powell confirmed that the pace of interest rate hikes will slow down as early as December, and the peak interest rate may be higher than expected",1669861394

* Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed Wednesday that smaller interest rate increases are likely ahead and could start in December.
* But he cautioned that monetary policy is likely to stay restrictive for some time until real signs of progress emerge on inflation.
* ‚ÄúWe will stay the course until the job is done,‚Äù he said during a speech in Washington, D.C. at the Brookings Institution.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed Wednesday that smaller interest rate increases are likely ahead even as he sees progress in the fight against inflation as largely inadequate.

Echoing recent statements from other central bank officials and comments at the November Fed meeting, Powell said he sees the central bank in position to reduce the size of rate hikes as soon as next month.

But he cautioned that monetary policy is likely to stay restrictive for some time until real signs of progress emerge on inflation.

‚ÄúDespite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability,‚Äù Powell said in remarks delivered at the Brookings Institution.

The chairman noted that policy moves such as interest rate increases and the reduction of the Fed‚Äôs bond holdings generally take time to make their way through the system.

‚ÄúThus, it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThe time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting.‚Äù

Markets already had been pricing in about a 65% chance that the Fed would step down its interest rate increases to half of a percentage point in December, following four successive 0.75-point moves, according to CME Group data. That pace of rate hikes is the most aggressive since the early 1980s.

What remains to be seen is where the Fed goes from there. With markets pricing in the likelihood of rate cuts later in 2023, Powell instead warned that restrictive policy will stay in place until inflation shows more consistent signs of receding.

‚ÄúGiven our progress in tightening policy, the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation, and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level,‚Äù Powell said.

‚ÄúIt is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time. History cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe will stay the course until the job is done.‚Äù

Powell‚Äôs remarks come with some halting signs that inflation is ebbing and the ultra-tight labor market is loosening.

Earlier this month, the consumer price index indicated inflation rising but by less than what economists had estimated. Separate reports Wednesday showed private payroll growth far lower than expected in November while job openings also declined.

However, Powell said short-term data can be deceptive and he needs to see more consistent evidence.

For instance, he said Fed economists expect that the central bank‚Äôs preferred core personal consumption expenditures price index in October, to be released Thursday, will show inflation running at a 5% annual pace. That would be down from 5.1% in September but still well ahead of the Fed‚Äôs 2% long-run target.

‚ÄúIt will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining,‚Äù Powell said. ‚ÄúBy any standard, inflation remains much too high.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will simply say that we have more ground to cover,‚Äù he added.

Powell added that he expects the ultimate peak for rates ‚Äì the ‚Äúterminal rate‚Äù ‚Äì will be ‚Äúsomewhat higher than thought‚Äù when the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee members made their last projections in September. Committee members at the time said they expected the terminal rate to hit 4.6%; markets now see it in the 5%-5.25% range, according to CME Group data.

Supply chain issues at the core of the inflation burst have eased, Powell said, while growth broadly as slowed to below trend, even with a 2.9% annualized gain in third-quarter GDP. He expects housing inflation to rise into next year but then likely fall.

However, he said the labor market has shown ‚Äúonly tentative signs of rebalancing‚Äù after job openings had outnumbered available workers by a 2 to 1 margin. That gap has closed to 1.7 to 1 but remains well above historical norms.

The tight labor market has resulted in a big boost in worker wages that nonetheless have failed to keep up with inflation.

‚ÄúTo be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing. But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2% inflation,‚Äù he said.

Powell spoke at length about the factors keeping labor force participation low, a key factor in addressing the imbalance between open jobs and available workers. He said an important issue as been ‚Äúexcess retirements‚Äù during the Covid pandemic.

* Elon Musk thinks a recession is coming and worries the Federal Reserve‚Äôs attempts to bring down inflation could make it worse.

In a tweet early Thursday, the Tesla CEO and Twitter owner called on the Fed ‚Äúto cut interest rates immediately‚Äù or risk ‚Äúamplifying the probability of a severe recession.‚Äù

The remarks came in an exchange with Tesmanian co-founder Vincent Yu in which several others participated.

Later in the thread, NorthmanTrader founder Sven Henrich observes that the Fed ‚Äústayed too easy for too long totally misreading inflation and now they‚Äôve tightened aggressively into the highest debt construct ever without accounting for the lag effects of these rate hikes risking they‚Äôll be again late to realize the damage done.‚Äù

Musk replied, ‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù

This isn‚Äôt the first time Musk has warned of impending economic doom.

In a similar exchange on Oct. 24, the world‚Äôs richest man estimated a global recession could last ‚Äúuntil the spring ‚Äô24,‚Äù though he noted he was ‚Äújust guessing.‚Äù That prediction came amid a slew of economic warnings from other business executives including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon.

The Fed appears to be entering the late stages of a rate-hiking campaign aimed at tackling inflation still running near its highest level in more than 40 years. The central bank has increased its benchmark rate half a dozen times this year, taking the overnight borrowing rate to a target range of 3.75%-4%, and is expected to hike a few more times before stopping.

In recent days, Fed officials have said they expect smaller increases ahead than the four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases, the most recent of which came in early November.

The fund consists mostly of tech names, which tend to underperform in rising interest rate environments as investors are seeing now as the Federal Reserve hikes rates to tame high inflation.

But, as the central bank‚Äôs aggressive rate hikes start to slow the economy and potentially tip the U.S. into a recession, **Wood expects the tide to turn for her fund.**

 ‚ÄúInterest rates will follow inflation,‚Äù she said during a CNBC Pro Talk on Monday. **‚ÄúIt does seem like inflation has peaked, and if this is the main reason that our strategy and strategies like ours have been pummeled in the last 18 months to two years, then one would surmise that we should benefit from the opposite scenario.‚Äù**

When sentiment gets very bleak, or it‚Äôs clear that the economy is deteriorating, that‚Äôs often when the Fed would pause interest rate hikes or even begin cutting them. That generally benefits growth strategies like hers, she said.

**She added that another reason her strategies tend to outperform in a prerecessionary environment is that they are looking toward new leadership, and the companies she invests in are setting themselves up to benefit from what Ark sees as one of** **the most massive exponential growth opportunities in history****.**

‚Äú**The other reason is because our fundamentals are far superior to those of companies who are more cyclically biased,**‚Äù she said. ‚Äú**And so, we will have superior revenue growth and our cash flows will continue to increase on balance during a period like that.‚Äù**

## Biggest recession factor right now

In terms of a potential 2023 recession, the biggest factor Wood sees right now is the aggressive pace of interest rate hikes to cool off hot inflation.

She sees Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as taking a page from previous Fed Chair Paul Volcker, who dealt with high inflation in the 1970s and ‚Äô80s by **pushing interest rates up quickly.**

**‚ÄúTaking interest rates up 16-fold, we think is a mistake,‚Äù** said Wood. She added that she sees an inventory recession ahead because of how companies over-ordered as demand spiked during Covid, fueled by pandemic stimulus measures.

**‚ÄúWe have a huge inventory problem,‚Äù** Wood said, adding that she expects most of it to be cleaned out by Christmas. Still, ramifications for retail profits will likely be severe, she said.

She doesn‚Äôt agree that 2023 will be the start of a downward spiral. Instead, she expects a synchronized global recession with economic issues in China due to zero-Covid policies and property and the energy crisis in Europe.

**‚ÄúI think the rest of the world will lead us down because they are in a recession and in a more serious recession than I think the U.S. will be,‚Äù said Wood.**

# [S&amp;P 500 futures are flat as Wall Street awaits Powell speech on economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures were flat on Wednesday as Wall Street awaits an afternoon speech on the economy from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures were essentially little changed, with the benchmark looking to snap a 3-day losing streak. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 18 points. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Traders were hit with two reports Wednesday morning that caused volatility in stock futures. On one hand, a labor report signaled the job market could be cooling, raising hopes the Federal Reserve would slow its aggressive rate-hiking campaign. On the other hand, an updated reading of third-quarter gross domestic product was released and it showed the economy was stronger last period than first realized.
*****
&gt; Payroll processing firm ADP said Wednesday that private companies added just 127,000 positions for the month, well below the 190,000 consensus estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; But the Bureau of Economic Analysis also said Wednesday that third-quarter GDP increased at a 2.9% annual rate, according to its second estimate. That was revised higher from the 2.6% first estimate.
*****
&gt; Powell will give a speech at the Brookings Institution this afternoon that may give further insight into the central bank‚Äôs thinking on future interest rate increases. The Fed is slated to meet later this month and is largely expected to deliver a smaller 0.5 percentage point rate hike after four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases to tame high inflation. Any signal of a pivot on future rate hikes would likely send markets higher.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThis is a Fed-made recession, so eventually when he does pivot, the market should move higher pretty quickly,‚Äù said Steve Grasso, CEO of Grasso Global, on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúFast Money‚Äù Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a mixed session. The Nasdaq Composite shed 0.59% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.16%, marking the third straight negative day for each. The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a marginal gain, closing 3.07 points, or 0.01%, higher.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been weighed down by China‚Äôs zero-Covid policy and have failed to fully recover from losses even as the country announced steps toward reopening, such as an uptick in vaccination rates for the elderly.

* **Some even say they're trading in their vehicles, according to their Twitter posts.**
* **Investor sentiment toward Tesla has also declined since Musk's Twitter deal, per Morgan Stanley.**

Some Tesla fans are feeling less than enthusiastic about the EV company since Elon Musk's Twitter takeover.

Many are venting their frustration on twitter (ironic) followed by the hashtag #nevertesla.  Some drivers even say they've traded in their Teslas after watching the billionaire's antics at Twitter.¬†

A scroll through the #nevertesla hashtag brings up many similar sentiments.

Other users, who don't appear to have ever been particular fans of Musk, are also using the hashtag.

Investor sentiment toward Tesla has also recently declined, according to a Morgan Stanley survey.

Around 65% of the survey's respondents said Musk's highly publicized dramas at Twitter ""will have a negative or slightly negative impact on Tesla's business going forward."" One potential risk could be a drop in consumer sentiment or demand, Morgan Stanley said in a note on Monday.

In addition, Tesla drivers say they are facing aggression on the road. An August report from Axios found Tesla drivers in Iowa were ""routinely heckled, cut off in traffic, and blocked from charging stations."" Many Tesla drivers blamed the treatment on the behavior of Musk and the news cycle in the months before his Twitter purchase, per Axios.¬†

2750,StockMarket,"The fall in Tesla's share of global EV sales (as I have posted before to ridicule) continues in 2022 (as it does in pure BEV's).

Tesla's mkt share topped out at 17% of global EV sales (245K/2.0M) in 2019.  It will likely be just 13% of 2022 final global EV sales (and 18% of BEV's from 21% in 2021 and 23% in 2020).

Its growth in sales has been impressive, but still below that of the broader EV market, be it by new entrants, or existing competitors.  Whilst Tesla dominates the US mkt still (albeit falling slightly recently) recent sales figures in China show 1 in 3 cars sold is a plug-in and 1 in 4 cars in Europe.  These are huge mkts, bigger than the US, that Tesla's rivals, be they legacy makers or newer EV entrants, have happily supplied with EV models, be they BEV's or hybrids.

BYD taking over Tesla in EV sales in 2022 has been well reported, but Tesla remains in top spot in pure BEV's.  January to September 2022 EV sales however suggest Tesla is on course for around 13% of the global EV market (vs BYD 17%):

(interesting that the author also notes over 50% of Tesla's are now Chinese made)

This is a good reference point for past yearly sales:

[https://cleantechnica.com/2022/01/31/tesla-1-in-world-ev-sales-in-2021/](https://cleantechnica.com/2022/01/31/tesla-1-in-world-ev-sales-in-2021/)

Anyone following the Chinese and EU markets will have been impressed with the sheer explosion of models available from other companies.  These are now starting to flow into the US mkt, which still saw less than 1 in 20 cars sales in 2021 as EV's, but is utterly dominated by Tesla.  That dominance is just starting to fade:

Only slowly however, as whilst Chinese and European mkts have over 100 EV models to choose from, US mkt choice is still limited to around 40 models.

2760,StockMarket,"For years, only one customer mattered in the market for lithium and other metals used in electric vehicle batteries: **Tesla Inc.**  The prospect that a new mine might end up feeding Elon Musk‚Äôs automaker was enough to sway cautious lenders to finance a project or convince investors that untested operations had a shot at meeting aggressive sales projections. And as the biggest buyer in a sector full of startup miners, **Tesla wielded unusual power to dictate terms, typically locking in agreements for supplies for years at fixed prices.**

An aggressive push into electric vehicles by legacy car manufacturers, and worries over tight markets for lithium and other key materials such as nickel and graphite, is upending those dynamics. **Ford Motor Co. and GM have roiled the industry by striking generous pacts with prospective suppliers that include commitments to pay upfront for future deliveries or offer cheap loans to build new mines.**

**Tesla, by contrast, has resisted partnering with suppliers in developing new operations, and Musk has repeatedly rejected proposals to acquire lithium companies or mines to lock in supplies, according to people familiar with his thinking.** The increased competition has emboldened miners and refiners and is exposing Musk‚Äôs reluctance to adapt his strategy, posing a new threat to Tesla‚Äôs plans to boost production, reduce costs and establish its own lithium refinery in Texas, according to the people, who requested anonymity to discuss private matters.

**Musk‚Äôs lead in lithium is evaporating as rivals ‚Äústuff money into a bazooka and just blast it at the supply chain,‚Äù** says Chris Berry, president of House Mountain Partners, a battery-metals consultant. **‚ÄúTesla can‚Äôt throw their weight around in terms of negotiations.‚Äù** Tesla didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.

**Ford in June sealed a pact with Liontown Resources Ltd.,** which aims to build a mine in Australia, that included a A$300 million ($199 million) loan from the automaker at comparatively low terms. Livent Corp., the No. 3 lithium producer, said in August that GM will pay $198 million in advance under a six-year agreement that starts in 2025.

Tesla in October ended months of negotiations with mine developer Core Lithium Ltd. without a contract for lithium supply. Musk has rejected proposals for Tesla to acquire lithium operations in Australia, Canada and the US, according to the people. The automaker held talks in 2020 to acquire Cypress Development Corp., a US project developer, but didn‚Äôt reach a deal. And across the industry, doubts are mounting about an agreement Tesla struck 2 years ago to start getting raw materials from Piedmont Lithium Inc. by next summer while the miner chases approvals for a project in North Carolina.

**Lithium demand is expected to jump more than fivefold by the end of the decade**. EV sales targets for 2030 are probably unachievable because of constraints on various raw materials, according to Piper Sandler &amp; Co. New lithium mines can cost as much as $1 billion and take more than six years to build, too slow for the sector‚Äôs needs, Piper analysts wrote in a November note. And BloombergNEF predicts shortages of lithium will be a problem until 2026 for companies that refine the products into chemicals used in EV batteries.

That‚Äôs pushing lithium prices to new records. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite important for us to play the right game,‚Äù says Gareth Manderson, Core Lithium‚Äôs chief executive officer. ‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt be doing the right thing by our shareholders if we didn‚Äôt ensure that we were getting the best pricing.‚Äù Investors are increasingly focused on details of pricing in supply pacts, and they see as much value in deals with Ford, GM, Mercedes-Benz Group or Toyota Motor as they do with Tesla, he says.

I would really like to get into investing, as with my work I have some cash each month on the side (not a lot) and holding it in a bank seems stupid.

How viable is low cash investing (I don't know if there is a term for that), but let me explain. Lets say i have between 200-400$ a month spare to invest. Is it at all viable to start buying ""stable"" stocks that over time SHOULD be going up but in small intervals? 

For example buying one stock of Appl, Amzn and maybe some other industry giant and planing for the long term. So the strategy would be every month buy 2-3 high value stocks and maybe if I have some money left over gamble with something cheap in higher quantitiy? 

Is this strategy at all viable? Or should I try to accumulate a bigger amount of money and then buy lets say something like TSLA but 10-20 stocks at once (Maybe a bad example with the recent  shit show but something equivalet to that)

2786,StockMarket,"Morgan Stanley, the world's leading international financial services company, recently released the ""2023 Macroeconomic Outlook"" and ""2023 Investment Strategy Outlook"". Morgan Stanley expects that global economic growth will weaken next year, inflation will fall, and interest rate hikes will end. There will be upside in equities and emerging markets.

&amp;#x200B;

Global Macroeconomic Outlook 2023:

&amp;#x200B;

Inflation peaks, growth slows

&amp;#x200B;

Morgan Stanley believes that excess consumer demand after the epidemic, retail inventory inflation and the struggle with inflation will continue to drag down economic growth in 2023. Global GDP growth will peak at only 2.2%, narrowly avoiding a recession, but lower than in 2022. 3% annual growth is expected.

&amp;#x200B;

Key takeaways from Morgan Stanley's 2023 Global Economic Outlook:

&amp;#x200B;

‚óèThe US economy will stand still with a growth rate of 0.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

‚óèThe economies of Europe and the UK may contract.

&amp;#x200B;

‚óè Emerging market economies are expected to recover moderately.

&amp;#x200B;

The good news is that global inflation will peak in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to Morgan Stanley. In fact, factors such as slowing demand, rising inventories and falling prices due to falling house prices will help moderate inflation, which in turn will prompt major central banks to pause the pace of rate hikes.

&amp;#x200B;

""The pace of increases in the federal funds rate over the past 12 months is the fastest since 1981, and the pace of rate increases in the European Central Bank is the fastest since the creation of the euro zone,"" said Seth B. Carpenter, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley. ""A sharper and broader pullback in inflation will mean easier global macroeconomic policy decisions and a flatter path for global growth as supply chains for consumer goods repair and labor market frictions ease. .‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Looking ahead to 2023, Morgan Stanley says that while we will see few big surprises, there will be plenty of nuance. As always, the situation varies from region to region, even to some extent. Unlike the economic outlook in Europe and the United States, Asia allows us to see the buds of economic growth, especially India. With the US federal funds rate raised to the peak and the US dollar weakening, emerging market economies may further benefit.

&amp;#x200B;

US: Soft Landing + Moderate Recovery

&amp;#x200B;

Morgan Stanley said U.S. consumer prices, which are closely watched, are now up 8.2% year-over-year but will slow to 2.4% year-over-year by the end of 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

Slowing economic growth and cooling inflation could prompt the Fed to stop raising interest rates. ""We expect the target range for the federal funds rate to peak at 4.5% to 4.75% by January 2023, then remain there for all of 2023, then A steady decline through 2024. In this scenario, the U.S. economy is expected to experience a soft landing and a modest rebound, rather than a hard landing or a faster recovery as currently widely believed.""

&amp;#x200B;

Also, while the Fed has been reducing debt ratios by not replacing maturing government bonds, such as Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, sales of government bonds are not expected to be active, Zentner added. The housing market has fallen, so selling mortgage-backed securities may be overkill.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the labor market, Morgan Stanley believes that while corporate hiring has slowed, large-scale layoffs in the U.S. are unlikely in 2023 due to declining salaries and difficulties in recruiting professional and technical positions. The marked slowdown in net employment growth over the past year, combined with a modest increase in the labor force participation rate, could lead to a modest increase in the unemployment rate to 4.3% by the end of 2023, although such a small increase is still relatively healthy.","Morgan Stanley's latest research and judgment!

Shopify Inc., a company that suffered from one of the worst fallouts of the covid pandemic and lost over 70% in 2022, is finally showing signs of recovery. We all know Shopify by now, but for those who aren‚Äôt familiar, Shopify is the most famous e-commerce store builder out there, dominating 29% market share of e-commerce sales software.But after the Covid restrictions had finally lifted, e-commerce companies have gone through a fallout (YoY growth-wise). The struggle continues even today, with consumer spending decreasing while costs are increasing. But even though SHOP is having tough times, Q3 shows a positive turning point.  

## Why you should invest in $SHOP

Despite the current e-commerce slowing, global e-commerce sales are expected to reach $8.1 trillion by 2026. Online shopping is here to stay and will probably grow as technologies like AR make the internet a much more interactive environment. In Q3, SHOP reported better-than-expected revenue and a narrower-than-expected loss, which surged its stock 17% on October 27. Looking further into the financials, SHOP revenue increased 22% YoY ($1.37B) and beat estimates by $30M, SHOP also lost 2 cents per share beating analysts' estimate by 5 cents per share. Their 2 most profitable segments are Subscription solutions, which increased 12% YoY($376.3m), and Merchant solutions which increased by 26% ($989.9m). The company keeps creating successful solutions like Shopify Payments, and great acquisitions like Deliverr, an e-commerce shipping company. Overall, the company shows continuous successful initiatives that maintain great growth. Similar to what Amazon did, Shopify‚Äôs plan is to simplify logistics and support fast deliveries across the U.S.  

# Why you shouldn‚Äôt invest in $SHOP

Short-term, I estimate that $SHOP will be negatively impacted by its continued investments. Shopify‚Äôs operating expenses increased by almost 45% in Q3 of 2022 compared to last year, expenses were mostly invested in marketing - Shopify relies heavily on marketing. Worth mentioning that the company anticipates a decrease in operating expenses for Q4, analysts think the same.  

## Final Thoughts

It‚Äôs safe to say Shopify is the leading company in the e-commerce market, and with a successful portfolio of recent acquisitions and initiatives, I believe this company is in good hands, steering to the right direction.With that being said, Shopify is currently investing a lot of money in itself, meaning the stock is in a volatile state, and it‚Äôs reasonable that the stock will be affected negatively in the short term. **SHOP is a great value investment, and I will probably buy a position at a better buying point sometime in the near future.** [**Follow my portfolio**](https://www.jika.io/u/Ofir) **to know when.**

*****
&gt; Futures connected to the S&amp;P 500 rose Tuesday as worries over unrest in China and its Covid protocols appeared to ease.
*****
&gt; The broad index‚Äôs futures added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.4%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded near flat.
*****
&gt; The move follows stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai rallying overnight as a Chinese official told reporters that 65.8% of people ‚Äúover age 80‚Äù had received booster shots. On top of that, the government reported the first decline in Covid infections within mainland China in more than a week.
*****
&gt; Those updates follow the declines in U.S. and foreign markets seen Monday after protests in mainland China against the country‚Äôs zero-Covid policy started over the weekend. West Texas Intermediate crude futures briefly fell to their lowest point since last December while all three of the major U.S. indexes ended the day down more than 1% as investors grew increasingly concerned about if Chinese Covid protocols could hamper global supply chains.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some real reasons to be cautious. The market‚Äôs rallied a lot this quarter, and there‚Äôs some concerns that things are going to slow, so I think it‚Äôs a kind of balanced risk reward,‚Äù Trivariate Research‚Äôs Adam Parker said Monday on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell: Overtime.‚Äù
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think there was an excuse with maybe some China slowdown fears for people to collect a little profit that they made in the quarter,‚Äù he added.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, traders will watch for the September reading of the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index that is due Tuesday before the bell. The report will give investors insight into how higher interest rates are affecting the housing market. Home prices in the prior month jumped about 13% year over year.

&gt; Meanwhile, the latest reading on consumer confidence is set to release at 10 a.m. Wall Street is also expecting the latest corporate earnings results from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Tuesday after the bell.

The filing in a New Jersey court comes as crypto prices have plummeted. The price of bitcoin , the most popular digital currency by far, is down more than 70% from a 2021 peak.

 

""Although the debtors' exposure to FTX is a major cause of this bankruptcy filing, the debtors do not face the myriad issues apparently facing FTX,"" said the bankruptcy filing by Mark Renzi, managing director at Berkeley Research Group, the proposed financial advisor for BlockFi. ""Quite the opposite.""

BlockFi said the liquidity crisis was due to its exposure to FTX via loans to Alameda, a crypto trading firm affiliated with FTX, as well as cryptocurrencies held on FTX's platform that became trapped there.

* Sees higher default risk in private credit and leveraged loans

The head of performing credit for one of the world‚Äôs largest distressed debt firms, Oaktree Capital Management, says **there are pockets of opportunity in junk bonds for investors willing to look past more volatility and wider credit spreads in 2023.**

**‚ÄúThere are some bargains to be had,‚Äù Armen Panossian, who is also the chief executive of Oaktree Specialty Lending Corp., said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. ‚ÄúThe percentage of BB rated high-yield bonds is the highest it has been in 10 years with 60% of the market being lightly levered and offering attractive return with dollar prices on those instruments in the seventies and eighties.‚Äù**

**Higher quality tiers of junk bonds are attractive in dollar price and absolute yield terms, Panossian said.** Gains in US junk bonds extended across ratings in the last week, following a fresh injection of cash into the asset class and a host of commentary from Federal Reserve officials supporting a slower pace of hikes.

**Panossian expects the sector to deliver a strong performance over the next two years**, **reserving default concerns for lower-quality CCC-rated bonds.** The US corporate high-yield benchmark has sold off roughly 11% so far in 2022.

‚ÄúIf you look at the maturity schedule for high-yield bonds, only 6% of that market matures between now and the end of 2024,‚Äù said Panossian. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really the CCCs and lower rated securities that are maturing in the near team and therefore, there will be some level of defaults.‚Äù

2838,StockMarket,"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Morgan Stanley, previously bullish on the dollar, have now reversed their views, saying the era of dollar strength is ending as slowing prices drive markets to reduce bets on Fed tightening. This could provide buying opportunities for currencies in Europe, Japan and emerging markets.

Wall Street is reversing previously bullish dollar bets. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, which were previously bullish on the dollar, have now changed their view, arguing that the era of dollar strength is ending as slowing prices drive markets, reducing bets on Fed tightening. This could provide buying opportunities for currencies in Europe, Japan and emerging markets.

On Monday, JPMorgan strategist Kerry Craig told the media:Markets now have a better grasp of the Fed's trajectory. The dollar is no longer the one-way buying trend we've seen this year. Currencies such as the euro and the yen have room to rebound.

James Athey, investment director at Abrdn Interest Rate Management in the United Kingdom, said: ""Inflation in the United States shows signs of slowing down, and the Fed realizes that raising interest rates will have a lagging impact on price growth. At the same time, we believe that the divergence of monetary policy between the United States and Japan has reached its limit. ""

About a month ago, Abrdn changed his dollar position from overweight to neutral, expecting the greenback to weaken against the yen and sterling.

Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Sheets is among others predicting that the dollar's rally will peak this quarter before retreating in 2023, supporting emerging market assets. HSBC strategist Paul Mackel also thinks the dollar could plunge starting next year.

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the greenback against 10 major currencies, has fallen more than 6% from its September high. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar has fallen against all G-10 currencies over the past month, losing about 7% against the Japanese yen and the New Zealand dollar.

As of now, the U.S. dollar index is at 106.6, down 7% from a high of 114 in September this year.

Global asset managers increased bets on a weaker dollar to the highest level since July 2021 in the week ended Nov. 18, the latest data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed. In addition, earlier data showed that investors increased their holdings of the U.S. dollar in the week ended November 20, with 321,758 U.S. dollar short contracts, rising to a new high in more than a year; hedge funds are also bearish on the currency and have sold U.S. dollars for five consecutive weeks.

The minutes of the latest FOMC meeting support their view. Most officials agree that a slow pace of rate hikes soon is appropriate. Market expectations for a peak Fed rate have fallen below 5% from above 5% in early November, according to an overnight swap index.

U.S. Treasury yields are also showing signs of peaking, with the 10-year yield down about 70 basis points from its October high.

But not everyone is selling the dollar. Agnes Belaisch, a strategist at Barings in London, believes that the Fed remains focused on ensuring inflation is under control, which means rates may have to stay elevated for some time before starting to cut rates, supporting dollar assets:

# [Stock futures fall as unrest in China grows over Covid restrictions](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/27/stock-futures-slip-after-a-winning-holiday-week-.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Monday as social unrest from China‚Äôs prolonged Covid restrictions weighed on markets, sending oil prices lower ‚Äî after Wall Street notched gains during the Thanksgiving holiday-shortened week.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 178 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each dropped 0.7%.
*****
&gt; Over the weekend, demonstrations broke out in mainland China as people vented their frustrations with Beijing‚Äôs zero-Covid policy. Local governments tightened Covid controls as cases surged, even though earlier this month Beijing adjusted some policies that suggested the world‚Äôs second-biggest economy was on its way to reopening.
*****
&gt; The developments weighed on sentiment in Asia trading, with oil futures hovering around new 2022 lows around demand concerns. Shares of companies with big production facilities in the country led premarket losses. Shares of Apple lost 1.7% and Tesla declined 2.2% in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; The moves come after all three major U.S. indexes ended last week higher, even with the shortened trading time due to the Thanksgiving holiday. The Dow rose 1.78%, and the S&amp;P 500 increased 1.53% during the short week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lagged the other two indexes but was still up 0.72% in the same timeframe.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lifted during the week by comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that the central bank would step down its aggressive rate hike path as inflation cools. Minutes from the Fed‚Äôs November meeting confirmed the likely shift in policy.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúA substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,‚Äù the minutes stated.
*****
&gt; In the last week of November, investors will be watching more earnings reports and a slew of economic releases that will give further information on the state of the consumer and the U.S. economy. Intuit, Salesforce and Five Below are among companies scheduled to report earnings. Personal consumption data and the labor report for November will also be released this week.

Overnight, the three major U.S. stock indexes mixed¬†on the shortened¬†trading day due to the Thanksgiving holiday. By the close, the Dow was up 0.45%, the Nasdaq was down 0.52% and the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.03%.

.

SPY had an inside day last Friday and was still extended on the daily chart. Nevertheless, it had a time correction instead of price correction, which is considered more bullish than bearish. Although the time correction acted as a good news for people who are on the long side, SPY is having resistance around $403.

.

QQQ also had an inside day while it experienced a price correction instead of time correction. Being less extended than SPY, if QQQ cannot hold last Friday‚Äôs low, the next downside level is $280.46, which was the low of last Tuesday. The SMA50 for QQQ is flat now and it is still far away from SMA200.

.

The 10-year US Treasury yield rose 0.054% to 3.691%, compared with a yield spread of -78 basis points over the two-year note while VIX rose 0.39%. Brent crude closed down 1.47%. Spot gold closed up 0.03% at $1,754.6 an ounce. The dollar index was down 0.11%, closing at 106.08.

.

Online sales on Thanksgiving Day rose 2.9% to $5.29 billion from a year earlier, according to Adobe Analytics. Online sales on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, are expected to grow just 1% to $9 billion.

[Manchester United (MANU)](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-MANU/)

Manchester United rose 12.82% to $21.21, making the total weekly gain to 61%, its biggest weekly gain ever. Apple has no plans to buy English Premier League club Manchester United at this stage, , but former Manchester United star David Beckham has been rumored to be interested in purchasing the club. Elsewhere, Saudi Arabia says it wants its investors to buy Manchester United and Liverpool and wants Cristiano Ronaldo to play in its domestic league.

Although the bull flag we called out a week ago is working well, the MACD indicator is having a death cross for GS. In addition, the RSI indicator shows that GS can be overbought right now, so for traders who are interested in reversal trades and shorting, this is a stock that should be on watch-list. The upside level is $389.58, and for the downside is $375. This can be a great risk-reward, though the probability is not as high as with-trend trades.

**Opportunities**

Minutes from the Fed's November meeting showed that the central bank is making progress in fighting high inflation and wants to slow the pace of rate hikes, which would mean even smaller hikes by the end of this year and into 2023. As inflation seems to cool down a bit and Fed‚Äôs minutes show a potential slower hike, it is time to look for undervalued technology stocks with solid ROE and high gross margin, which will benefited slower pace of rate hikes.

However, the majority of that money, **84% ($70 million)**, came from [Bankman-Fried ](https://news.coincu.com/145535-galaxy-digital-ceo-criticizes-sam/)and other FTX executives.

2883,StockMarket,"In its latest report, Bank of America stated its investment strategy for 2023, arguing that it should be long in bonds in the first half of next year and long in stocks in the second half of the year.

&amp;#x200B;

On November 26, Michael Hartnett, an investment strategist at Bank of America, predicted in the latest report that in 2023, the global economy will experience a mild recession, with lower inflation, China's economic recovery, interest rates, yields, spreads, the US dollar, and oil prices will peak. U.S. stocks were flat, with gold and base metals set for gains.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of numbers:

&amp;#x200B;

U.S. GDP edged up by 0.4% in 2023;

U.S. CPI will drop from 8.1% to 4.4%;

The U.S. unemployment rate will jump from 3.7% to 5.5%;

The federal funds rate peaks at 5-5.25% in March next year, before the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points in December;

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to 3.25% from 4%;

Spreads on U.S. investment-grade bonds will tighten to 130 basis points;

USD peaked: EUR/USD rebounded to 1.10, JPY rebounded to 137, RMB rebounded to 7.00;

WTI crude oil prices are expected to peak at $104/bbl in the third quarter of 2023;

Gold will rebound to $2000/oz;

The target for the S&amp;P 500 by the end of 2023 is 4,000.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hartnett also laid out its investment strategy for 2023 in the report. He will remain bearish on risk assets in the first half of next year, but is likely to turn bullish in the second half as the market narrative shifts from an inflation and interest rate shock in 2022 to a recession and credit shock in the first half of next year. He recommends long U.S. Treasuries in the first half of next year as hard landing and credit event risks are underestimated.

&amp;#x200B;

Hartnett also said that in the second half of next year, a trend change in inflation, the federal funds rate, bond yields and a peak in the U.S. dollar will boost sentiment, recommending long equities.

&amp;#x200B;

He believes that relatively speaking, the situation in 2023 is not as pessimistic as 2022, because the market pessimism in 2022 is at the bottom; in addition, the possibility of the Fed raising interest rates multiple times in 2023 is also very small.

&amp;#x200B;

By asset class, Hartnett has positive returns on the following assets: 25% copper, 15-20% gold, 12-13% investment grade corporate bonds, 7-8% 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds, 5-6% oil %, cash 5%, U.S. equities 0%, USD-6%; additionally, commodities and emerging market assets delivered the strongest returns on peak dollar and inflation hedges.

&amp;#x200B;

Hartnett also identified the top 10 trading trends for 2023:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Long 30-year U.S. Treasuries - recession, job losses, Fed rate cuts at the end of 2023 and its history (U.S. Treasury yields have never fallen for 3 years in a row).

2. Yield curve steepening ‚Äì The U.S. yield curve always steepens at the start of a recession, with the market expecting the Fed to shift from raising to lowering rates.

3. Short the US dollar, long emerging market assets - long emerging market distressed bonds, the Korean won appreciates due to China's easing of epidemic restrictions, and the Mexican peso appreciates due to offshore outsourcing.

4. Long Chinese stocks - China has a high excess savings and is still a long inverse trading strategy for Chinese stocks.

5. Go long on gold and copper ‚Äì dollar peaks, China reopens, metal stocks are running low, energy transition accelerates, inflation hedges are needed in the 20s.

6. Long credit ‚Äì Long investment grade corporate bonds (yield over 5%) and Asian junk bonds (yield 17%).

7. Go long global industrials and small-cap stocks ‚Äì in the 1920s, the dominance of deflation was gradually shifting towards long-term inflation, driven by a shift from globalization to localization, monetary excess to fiscal excess, inequality to inclusiveness, etc. Asset shift; capex will be the new macro bull story.

8. Short U.S. tech stocks ‚Äì The valuation of tech stocks is still too high, the era of quantitative easing is over, the era of globalization is over, and factors such as regulatory risks are superimposed.

9. Short US private equity firms - citing shadow banking exposure to housing and credit risk, redemption risk, etc.

10. Long EU banks, short Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Swedes - EU fiscal stimulus will free the eurozone from Russian energy, Chinese exports and US military, and Canada , the collapse of the Australian, New Zealand and Swedish property markets.",2023 in the eyes of Wall Street's most prospective analysts of the year. and his top 10 deals,1669641125
2884,StockMarket,"Apple may fall short of its production target for its flagship iPhone 14 Pro models by nearly 6 million units worldwide, Bloomberg reported Monday, after workers at the world's largest iPhone manufacturing plant in Zhengzhou, China, protested delayed bonus payments, poor living conditions caused by China‚Äôs stringent Covid restrictions.

According to Bloomberg, the exact size of the shortfall still remains unclear and will likely depend on manufacturer Foxconn‚Äôs ability to hire enough workers for the iPhone assembly line to keep up with production targets.

Earlier this month, Apple had cut its production target for the iPhone 14 by 3 million units due to Covid-related disruptions at the Foxconn plant and that number has now been revised by double, the report adds.

Workers at the Foxconn plant in Zhengzhou‚Äîsometimes referred to as ‚ÄúiPhone city‚Äù‚Äîhave been forced to live on-site in a closed bubble, only being allowed to move from the factory floor to their dorm rooms due to the city‚Äôs Covid control measures.

While sales of the cheaper iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have slowed down, the pricier iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max have continued to remain in strong demand in the U.S., the report adds.

While the company has diversified its manufacturing line by making some of its devices in India and Vietnam, nearly all of its flagship iPhone 14 Pro models are made in the Zhengzhou factory.

Apple‚Äôs shares were down 1.87% in pre-market trading on Monday morning following the report.

Apple (AAPL) is currently down 1.9% in the premarket after the company reportedly may fall short of its production target for its flagship iPhone 14 Pro models by nearly 6 million units worldwide amid its China factory protests related to its Covid-19 restrictions.

Chevron was granted a new license to operate in Venezuela on Saturday the 26th of November

Chevron they have a lot of work to do

1) repair broken equipment

2) stop power outages

3) fix pipelines

4) rehire hundreds of workers

5) security threats involving gasoline theft

  Venezuelan analysts are estimating about 50 billion in expenses to restore the lost oil production in Venezuela

So within the next 6 months we can expect chevron to increase output by around 20,00 to 30,000 barrels a day, which doesn‚Äôt make much a difference to the global market

We‚Äôre expecting about a year at the least for Chevron &amp; their joint venture partner Petroleos de Venezuela to bring oil production back to 200,000 barrels a day 

**Price Cap + Embargo**  

The European commission and the G-7 are looking to put a cap on Russian crude at around 60 to 70 a barrel 

Russian crude has now fallen to 56 a barrel so it‚Äôs actually below the cap at the moment

The problem is that countries are saying this cap is too high and doesn‚Äôt do much to curb the kremlin‚Äôs revenues

The EU is also planning on putting an embargo on Russian crude said to take effect on December 5th

**Opec + Meeting**

We also have an OPEC + meeting December 4th and now we‚Äôre starting to hear whispers of a partial reversal of the 2m barrel a day production cut. At the same time we‚Äôre getting prince Abdulaziz calling for more production cuts. The news here is a little bit mixed, but likely where this goes will be determined after what happens with the EU embargo and the Russian crude price cap.

and what are oil futures doing right now? Take a look [Here](https://i.postimg.cc/BnQYmMYc/image.png). Down a whopping 2.7%

So long story short, watch out. This is likely the biggest news we will new in the coming weeks prior to CPI and Fed Economic forecast meeting.","So Much To Talk about surrounding Crude. Chevron License in Venezuela, Russian Crude Price Cap, EU Embargo, Opec + Meeting",1669608071

What I liked about this article is 1) it shows the size of the current problem 2) Current Technologies can't handle the current plastic waste problem 3) all the favourable tailwinds that apply to Aduro as well including a) ESG and the massive funding out there b) Higher oil prices and how recycling plastic waste can result in reduction of oil consumption c) Deglobalization / Onshoring d)   4) it Points out shortcomings of $PCT such as a) not owning their IP (instead, it's licensed for P&amp;G) b) large central units resulting in having to haul plastic waste cross states or within the state to a Central unit,  c) PureCycle can only handle Polypropylene post a very hefty pre-processing facility (essentially their process works on the cream of the crop only of PP)  d) high energy intake that results in a costly Opex process d) cash on hand while looks big at first, it is all earmarked to the first 2 commercial facilities, and there is a massive risk that they will need to raise more money to finish the build-up e) Purecycle doesn‚Äôt know for sure that their process is profitable in the current environment f) Need for a good source of Feedstock. These types of reports are music to my ears as they confirm how unique Aduro's Technology is; most of the shortcomings of PureCycle are non-existent for Aduro as Aduro owns their IP; they do not need to build central units that require massive Capex on their dime, the energy required is lower than any process out there, flexibility in handling any feedstock that a client has, a profitable process that is built on licensing and one that can work under almost any regulatory regime (such as having presence in Mexico) and finally a lean approach that doesn‚Äôt require excessive cash/dilution and yes I know they will likely need to raise money in the coming years but nothing in the hundreds of millions that most other approaches. Despite being very critical of all other Technologies that make massive claims and fall short of them, I do hope that PureCycle does work out because I would view them as a potential partner with Aduro down the road: [https://theunhedgedcapitalist.substack.com/p/stock-analysis-purecycle-technologies?utm\_source=post-email-title&amp;publication\_id=1043271&amp;post\_id=84597448&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;utm\_medium=email](https://theunhedgedcapitalist.substack.com/p/stock-analysis-purecycle-technologies?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=1043271&amp;post_id=84597448&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;utm_medium=email)",Aduro Clean Technologies (OTC: ACTHF) compared to PureCycle Technologies (Nas: PCT),1669581637

After a couple of years of falling global EV mkt shares in the world's largest markets (data I have flagged in plenty of previous posts to various ridicule of 'Tesla hater', 'retard', etc), where EV sales commonly feature in over 1 in 4 cars sold (The US around 1 in 20), it appears US Tesla EV sales are finally starting to wane with the diminished Musk myth, ergo Tesla brand:

[https://mediaroom.kbb.com/2022-11-16-BMW-Remains-Most-Shopped-Luxury-Brand-While-Toyota-Widens-Lead-as-Most-Shopped-Non-Luxury-Brand,-According-to-Latest-Kelley-Blue-Book-Reports](https://mediaroom.kbb.com/2022-11-16-BMW-Remains-Most-Shopped-Luxury-Brand-While-Toyota-Widens-Lead-as-Most-Shopped-Non-Luxury-Brand,-According-to-Latest-Kelley-Blue-Book-Reports)

Before the Stans' cry growth and tech, the arguments are so old and deficient vs Tesla's share price.  The robo-taxi myth has been firmly debunked.  There are still no standalone tech sales to business or customers other than adjuncts to energy or automotive products.  It is still essentially a BEV Automaker that will only marginally outsell Skoda in global car sales in 2022, but is still priced for taking over Mars and beyond.

I know I will get blasted by the Stan's, but at least do a little research on global EV sales before you commence your inane ramblings of Tesla's world domination of all things tech by at least gauging its falling dominance in EV's in recent years, with some objective analysis:

[https://cleantechnica.com/tag/ev-sales/](https://cleantechnica.com/tag/ev-sales/)

Some observers are perhaps confusing the deacceleration of Tesla US sales with diminished interest in EV's in the US. Interest is only increasing in Europe and Asia as some decent research will reveal:

2994,StockMarket,"**Warren Buffett is worth $100 Billion and is one of the most successful investors of all time. Here are his 55 investing tips from Warren Buffett:**

&amp;#x200B;

1. Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy only when others are fearful

2. Investing is laying out money now to get more back in the future

3. Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.

4. Our goal is to find an outstanding business at a sensible price, not a mediocre business at a bargain price.

5. It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.

6. Never invest in a business you cannot understand

7. The value of a business is the cash it's going to produce in the future

8. If a business does well, the stock eventually follows

9. Ignore the stock market, ignore the economy, and buy a business you understand

10. A great investment opportunity occurs when a marvelous business encounters a one-time huge, but solvable problem

11. Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing.

12. Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing

13. Diversification may preserve wealth, but concentration builds wealth

14. You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don‚Äôt do too many things wrong.

15. If you cannot control your emotions, you cannot control your money.

16. Look at market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy; profit from folly rather than participate in it.

17. Whether we‚Äôre talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down

18. Cash combined with courage in a time of crisis is priceless.

19. Don‚Äôt pass up something that‚Äôs attractive today because you think you will find something better tomorrow.

20. In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is owning the S&amp;P 500 index fund.

21. The Stock Market is designed to transfer money from the inpatient to the patient.

22. The true investor welcomes volatility... a wildly fluctuating market means that irrationally low prices will periodically be attached to solid businesses

23. Only buy something that you'd be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years.

24. Our favorite holding period is forever.

25. If you aren‚Äôt thinking about owning a stock for 10 years, don‚Äôt even think about owning it for 10 minutes.

26. Time is the friend of the wonderful business. 

27. Much success can be attributed to inactivity. Most investors cannot resist the temptation to constantly buy and sell.

28. The three most important words in investing are margin of safety.

29. The investor of today does not profit from yesterday‚Äôs growth

30. In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it's a weighing machine.

31. Buy something for less than it‚Äôs worth

32. Widespread fear is your friend as an investor because it serves up bargain purchases

33. When investing, pessimism is your friend, euphoria the enemy.

34. The most common cause of low prices is pessimism, sometimes pervasive, sometimes specific to a company or industry. We want to do business in such an environment, not because we like pessimism but because we like the prices it produces.

35. The United States endured two world wars, other traumatic and expensive military conflicts, the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics, oil shocks, a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497

36. The years ahead will occasionally deliver major market declines, even panics, that will affect virtually all stocks. No one can tell you when these traumas will occur

37. I think the worst mistake you can make in stocks is to buy or sell based on current headlines

38. Speculation is most dangerous when it looks easiest.

39. The best thing that happens to us is when a great company gets into temporary trouble...We want to buy them when they're on the operating table.

41. Opportunities come infrequently. When it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble.‚Äù

42. The best chance to deploy capital is when things are going down.

43. It‚Äôs been an ideal period for investors: A climate of fear is their best friend. Those who invest only when commentators are upbeat end up paying a heavy price for meaningless reassurance.

44. You‚Äôd get very rich if you thought of yourself as having a card with only twenty punches in a lifetime, and every financial decision used up one punch. You‚Äôd resist the temptation to dabble. You‚Äôd make more good decisions and you‚Äôd make more big decisions.

45. American business ‚Äî and consequently a basket of stocks ‚Äî is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead

46. We always live in an uncertain world. What is certain is that the United States will go forward over time.

47. For 240 years it‚Äôs been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start.

48. You've got to understand accounting. It's got to be like a language to you

49. If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.

50. Your best investment is yourself. The more you learn, the more you'll earn

# **Dow closes more than 150 points higher. Stocks notch gains for holiday week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose Friday, notching a gain during the holiday-shortened trading week.
*****
&gt; The Dow rose 152.97 points, or 0.45% to 34,347.03, marking the third consecutive session of gains. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.03% to end the day at 4,026.12. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.52% to 11,226.36, weighed down by shares of Activision Blizzard, which fell 4% on news that the FTC could block Microsoft from taking over the gaming company.
*****
&gt; All three indexes ended the week higher. The Dow is up 1.78%, and the S&amp;P 500 is up 1.53% during the short week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is lagging the other two indexes but is still up 0.72% in the same timeframe.
*****
&gt; Stocks were muted at the start of the week as traders waited for minutes from the Federal Reserve‚Äôs November meeting. The minutes showed that the central bank anticipates slowing the pace of interest rate hikes going forward, which gave stocks a boost into the end of the week even amid choppy sessions due to low trading volumes.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúA substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,‚Äù the minutes stated.
*****
&gt; A slew of solid retail earnings reports signaling some consumer strength even amid worries of economic weakness also lifted stocks.
*****
&gt; Worries about continued lockdowns in China kept markets in check. The country is ramping up Covid restrictions after seeing climbing case counts in recent days. Earlier in the week, China reported its first Covid deaths since May.
*****
&gt; Next week, investors will be watching for more earnings reports from companies such as Kroger and Ulta Beauty on deck. On the economic front, traders will be watching further comments from Fed officials, as well as the release of the personal consumption expenditure report on Thursday ‚Äî the central bank‚Äôs preferred inflation indicator. The November jobs print is due Friday.

&gt; # Tempered Yearend Gains When S&amp;P Down YTD Thanksgiving

&gt; Last year at this time on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving S&amp;P 500 was up 24.9% year-to-date. November 2021 gave back a fractional loss, but December and the Santa Claus Rally delivered solid gains.

&gt; But then the stuff hit the fan. Inflation became non-transitory, the Fed began tapering asset purchases and telegraphing imminent rate hikes, Russia invaded Ukraine and the bear came out of hibernation.

&gt; This year on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving the market is in an entirely different situation with S&amp;P down -16.0% YTD. The table here shows how the market claws its way back in most years with fewer but sizable losses bringing the averages down.

&gt; The fact that November 2022 is up so far is supportive for continued upside. What stands out to us in this table is the rather solid performance for the Tuesday before Thanksgiving-Santa Claus Rally trade as well as solid gains for the Santa Claus Rally itself.

&gt; We wish everyone a happy and festive Thanksgiving and hope that you all enjoy the time with friends and family!

&gt; # Continuing Claims Flash Recessionary Warning

&gt; Due to tomorrow's holiday, this week's jobless claims data was released a day early and were not exactly a release to be thankful for. The latest readings were bad all around with both initial and continuing claims rising more than expected. For initial claims, last week's level was revised up by 1K to 222K, and this week's reading rose by 18K to 240K. That is the highest level of claims since the week of August 18th, and the sequential increase was the largest since the end of September. Whereas recent readings on jobless claims have been healthy in the sense that they have remained within the range of low readings from the few years prior to the pandemic, this new high would have been at the high end of the 2008 to 2019 pre-pandemic range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/112322-Claims.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, the current week of the year typically sees claims move higher with a week-over-week increase 82% of the time. However, this week's increase was around 10K larger than what the comparable week of the year has historically averaged. In other words, from a seasonal perspective, the rise in claims is perfectly normal in terms of direction but less so in terms of size. Now at 248K, claims are in line with levels for the comparable weeks in 2021 and 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/112322-Claims-NSA.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims continue to be the more interesting story around jobless claims. Delayed one week to the initial claims number, continuing claims as of the week of November 11th rose for a sixth week in a row. As we noted last week, such a streak of consistent increases in continuing claims has been rare, especially in the years following the Global Financial Crisis. In fact, the rise during the onset of the pandemic in 2020‚Äîwhich lasted for 10 consecutive weeks‚Äîwas the only other notably lengthy streak post-2009. Prior to that, there have only been a handful of other times in which continuing claims have risen for 10 weeks or more.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/112322-Con-Claims-Streak.png))**

&gt; As for the current rise in claims, the latest increase leaves the reading at 1.551 million which is the highest level since the first week of March. From a historical perspective, though, that remains an impressively low reading and well below the pre-pandemic range even if it is rapidly deteriorating.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/112322-Con-Claims.png))**

&gt; As for just how bad of a stretch it has been for continuing claims, the 187K increase, or 13.7% jump, during the past six weeks would be by far the largest in over a decade outside of the start of the pandemic. Additionally, such a large increase in the span of six weeks is consistent with increases from all prior recessions. In fact, as claims have made their way off of historic lows, the current increase is nearly the same size as the early 1990s recession and is even larger than those in the early 1980s and early 2000s.

&gt; # Speculators Smelting Shorts

&gt; As we do each Monday, in last night's Closer we recapped the latest Commitments of Traders data from the CFTC. This data set provides a look at how speculators have positioned themselves (long or short) in various futures. We show those readings as a net percentage of open interest. In other words, higher positive values indicate a much larger share of open interest is positioned long and vice versa for negative readings.

&gt; In the commodities space, after longs backed out in a big way earlier this year, readings have risen rapidly in gold, silver, copper, and palladium futures. As for how sharp of turnarounds they have been, the increase over the past two weeks rank in the top decile of all periods in data going back to the mid 1980s for each of the previously mentioned metals.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/112222-COT-1.png))**

&gt; For the most widely followed of these metals (gold, silver, and copper), this is only the 14th time on record each of their two week changes ranked in the 90th percentile or above in the same week without another occurrence in the prior three months. The most recent occurrence of such a large broad increase in major metals positioning was in July of 2014.

&gt; Although these readings indicate that speculators are increasingly placing long bets on these futures, such data actually can be a bit of a messy indicator for forward performance. Although these readings indicate bullish sentiment, forward performance is the opposite in the near term with dramatic underperformance relative to the norm one week later (which we have seen play out so far). One month and three month performance tends to see further declines in these commodities as well which is not exactly unheard of for precious metals while it is dramatically weaker for the industrial metals. Six month performance is generally more in line with historical norms while the bullishness in positioning only seems to come through to price action one year out. One year average returns for gold, silver, and copper are much stronger than the norm, although positivity rates are still just barely above 50/50. (Past performance is no guarantee of future results.).

&gt; # The ‚ÄúMost Obvious‚Äù Bear Market Rally Ever?


&gt; ‚Äú The stock market is never obvious. It is designed to fool most of the people, most of the time.‚Äù Jesse Livermore

&gt; I‚Äôve noticed a trend the past few weeks and that is since the mid-October lows most commentators say we are obviously experiencing a bear market rally in stocks. But is it really so obvious? Remember, as one of the greatest traders ever said, the market‚Äôs job is to fool the masses most of the time. Wouldn‚Äôt it be something if this was actually the start of a new bullish phase and not just another bear market bounce?

&gt; # What‚Äôs a Bear Market?
First things first, what is a bear market rally? To me, it is when stocks bounce (potentially significantly), only to eventually move back to new lows. Think about the 17% rally the S&amp;P 500 saw over the summer, only to roll back over and make new lows in October. That‚Äôs a bear market rally, which is what most think is happening now.

&gt; # Calling This a Bear Market Rally Is Popular
Here‚Äôs the catch, most stocks actually bottomed back in June. That‚Äôs right, more 52-week lows took place in June than in October, so you could say we‚Äôve been in a new bull market for five full months now. Not a popular take I‚Äôm aware, but one that could be happening. Not to mention small caps didn‚Äôt break their June lows back in October. Remember, there are a lot more small caps than there are large caps, again suggesting the real lows took place in June, not October.

&gt; Here‚Äôs a very quick Google search of ‚Äòbear market rally‚Äô and you can get a taste for what I mean about most thinking this is nothing more than a bear market rally.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE #1!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-156.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE #2!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-23.png))**

&gt; I do a lot of social media, specifically Twitter, and I must say that the amount of anger when stocks go higher is about as high as I can ever remember. Bullish tweets or stats are simply crushed by an angry mob. Given this is a family website, I can‚Äôt share some of the comments, but let‚Äôs just say being remotely bullish is frowned upon by most investors and traders right now. Again, this is likely because some people believe it is so ‚Äòobvious‚Äô to everyone this is only a bear market rally, and new lows are a near certain but maybe it isn‚Äôt so obvious.

&gt; # More Signs the Crowd Isn‚Äôt In a Good Mood
The great Stoic philosopher, Seneca the Younger said, ‚ÄúWe suffer more often in imagination than in reality.‚Äù One might interpret that as we all worry too much and things really aren‚Äôt as bad as they seem. And this could be what is happening right now. We keep hearing how bad the economy is, yet as Sonu noted last week, the consumer is quite strong. In fact, the fourth quarter is expected to see GDP growth of more than 3% according to the Atlanta Fed. Speaking of Seneca the Younger, do you know who his father was? Seneca the Elder. I‚Äôm serious, that was his name. Gotta love Ancient Rome and its philosophers!

&gt; Enough Ancient Roman jokes and back to why this likely isn‚Äôt just a bear market rally, and why it could be the start to a new bullish move higher. One of my favorite surveys is the Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey. This monthly survey asks real money managers what they expect and how they are positioned. The recent report showed cash was up 6.2% of a portfolio, near the highest level since 2001, while a net 77% of respondents expected a global recession within 12 months.

&gt; But my favorite stat was ‚Äú0% were looking for a ‚Äògoldilocks‚Äô scenario.‚Äù Take note, this scenario would mean above-trend growth and below-trend inflation (See BofA Global Fund Manager Survey chart below). I agree it would be quite hard to expect that right here and now, but my takeaway is nearly no one is expecting good things to happen. Meaning expectations are historically low. As the chart below shows (focus on the yellow line), the last time it was this low was in late 2011, when all we heard about was the fiscal cliff drama out of Washington. Looking back, 2012, 2013, and 2014 were very solid years for both the economy and great years for the stock market. Given expectations got so low back then, good news then sparked a much better stock market and we think a similar situation could be in play again as we head into 2023.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-346-800x466.png))**

&gt; George Orwell said, ‚ÄúTo see what is in front of one‚Äôs nose is a constant struggle.‚Äù That is what is happening now, in my opinion. Things are getting better, yet people are focusing on the past and for some reason, angry about good news. My take is don‚Äôt be angry and embrace what could be better times and better news coming.

&gt; I hope everyone has a great Thanksgiving week and you all enjoy eating way too much food with family and friends!

&gt; # Time to Feast Thanksgiving-Santa Claus Rally Trade

&gt; Market action this past week and today has set up this annual market feast. Stocks have consolidated October‚Äôs big gains in typical early-November fashion setting the market up for the perennial yearend rally.

&gt; Since 1950 S&amp;P 500 is up 80% of the time from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to the 2nd trading day of the year, average gain 2.7%. Russell 2000 is up 79% of the time since 1979, average gain 3.4%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/296d2cdf14bf31f7acd66709ed72f8b6/4b3944852faa5d0b-54/s500x750/245e708ac6a7b175a622927710ec92d2460f8b0e.jpg))**

&gt; Thanksgiving kicks off a run of solid bullish seasonal patterns. November-January is the year‚Äôs best consecutive 3-month span (2023 STA p 149) and as we have been discussing all year we are at the outset of the ‚ÄúSweet Spot‚Äù of the 4-Year Cycle (2023 STA p 34). Then there‚Äôs the January Effect (2023 STA pgs 112 &amp; 114) of small caps outperforming large caps in January, which nowadays begins in mid-December.

&gt; And of course, the ‚ÄúSanta Claus Rally,‚Äù (2023 STA p 118) invented and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 in the Almanac and often misunderstood, is the short, sweet rally that runs from the last 5 trading days of the year to the first two trading days of the New Year. Pop also coined the phrase: ‚ÄúIf Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.‚Äù

&gt; So, we have combined these seasonal occurrences into one trade: Buy the Tuesday before Thanksgiving and hold until the 2nd trading day of the New Year. Our good friend and renowned technician and options guru Larry McMillan of the Options Strategist opened our eyes to this trade and runs it with options on iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) starting on the day before Thanksgiving.

* **Retailers are battling for shoppers‚Äô eyeballs and wallets amid an unusual holiday shopping season clouded with sky-high inflation.**

Walmart is top of mind for holiday shoppers who are hunting for Black Friday deals, according to new research.

The big box retailer is dominating online searches for Black Friday discounts as of Friday morning, according to advertising technology company Captify, which tracks more than 1 billion searches a day from websites globally.

**Searches for Black Friday discounts on Walmart surged 386% year over year, leapfrogging rival retailer** **Amazon****, which last year ranked first in Captify‚Äôs survey of most searched retailers on Black Friday. This year, the world‚Äôs largest e-commerce company ranked fourth, behind** **Target** **and Kohl's, respectively.**

Retailers are battling for shoppers‚Äô eyeballs and wallets at a time when the holiday shopping season is expected to be more subdued than in years past. Americans are expected to pull back on their holiday shopping this year as sky-high inflation squeezes their spending power.

The National Retail Federation said it expects holiday sales during November and December to rise between 6% and 8% from last year, a decline when factoring in the effect of inflation. Online sales during the months of November and December are forecast to grow a meager 2.5% to $209.7 billion, compared with an 8.6% increase a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics.

**Early signs show the season may not be as gloomy as predicted. Online sales climbed 2.9% year over year to $5.29 billion on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe Analytics said.** That‚Äôs slightly higher than its estimates for growth during the overall holiday season.

Black Friday is expected to pull in $9 billion in online sales, a 1% jump from the previous year, according to Adobe.

Shopify merchants saw a solid start to the holiday period. Businesses who host their online stores on Shopify were raking in $1.52 million per minute on Thanksgiving Day, according to the company.

Share BUYBACK was approved over 1.5  years ago. However IMHO this will not be implemented until they are turning great profit and the share price is under valued. 

AAPL has 17 billion shares outstanding and we have 960 million shares outstanding so no need for any future votes on RS when we are very profitable. It may take a while but worth getting in early. 

Zomedica is up-listed on NYSE American and compliance is ONLY $.20.

3017,StockMarket," They call it a miracle. What if this novel psychedelic could be the solution to alcoholism? Recent up-list to the NASDAQ with a 1.29M share float.

Good day everyone,

**Clearmind Medicine Inc. (NASDAQ: CMND) (CSE: CMN)** is a psychedelic pharmaceutical biotech company focused on the discovery and development of novel psychedelic-derived therapeutics to solve widespread and underserved health problems.

Current price $4.61/share (as of market close 11-24-22)

There are quite a few companies in the biopharma sector working with psychedelics to develop compounds to treat mental illnesses. I want to talk about CMND because I think they have developed a novel compound and are approaching treatment in a different way.

**Recent structural change at CMND:**

The company implemented a 1-for-30 reverse stock split, which was effective at 5:30 p.m. on September 30, 2022. CMND also uplisted to the NASDAQ on November 15, 2022, and on November 17th the company announced it closed a public offering of 1,153,847 common shares at a price to the public of $6.50 per share for gross proceeds of $7.5 million. It was a busy couple of weeks for the company.

The lead product at CMND is called CMND-100, a compound based upon the MEAI (5-Methoxy-2-aminoindane) psychoactive molecule. The company believes that MEAI could be used in treatment for Alcohol Abuse Disorder (AUD), binge eating, depression, psychotherapy, along with other mental health issues and binging disorders. The company‚Äôs goal is to develop CMND-100 as an orally self-administered product.

CMND is about to enter a human clinical trial for the treatment of AUD. I‚Äôm not going to quote a litany of statistics about alcohol abuse. We all know what the studies will say and most of us have personally been touched by the negativity of an alcohol abuse situation.

While CMND will be the first company to look for FDA approval for MSEI, it has been used by some as a recreational psychedelic drug and here are a couple comments made by those users:

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the ‚Äòenough‚Äô switch. It signals to the brain that it is satisfied, that it wants nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúMEAI exerts a euphoric alcohol-like experience and a reduced desire to consume alcoholic beverages.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter consuming it, I feel intense but controlled euphoria. Now the idea of drinking alcohol seems repulsive‚Äîas does eating bar food.‚Äù

I urge you to [watch this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQikn6O3qw) detailing the development of MEAI, with comments from the company team and testimonials.

I also want you to consider this quote from CMND CEO Dr. Adi Suloff-Shani, ‚Äúwhat we see is so phenomenal that I have to be very optimistic about how psychedelics can actually completely change the way we treat mental health issues today.‚Äù

On [Wednesday this week, CMND announced](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clearmind-announces-initiation-cmnd-100-134500937.html) the initiation of clinical batches of production of its novel psychedelic-derived drug candidate, the MEAI- based molecule- CMND-100. The produced batches will be used in the Company's upcoming first human clinical trial evaluating the proprietary drug candidate compound CMND-100 for the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). This step marks the initial move into clinical trials.

The Company‚Äôs intellectual portfolio currently consists of seven patent families that include **8 granted patents and 15 pending applications**. The portfolio spans a wide range of jurisdictions including the US, Europe, India, and China.

In the interest of transparency CMND has stated how they plan to use the proceeds from their recent public offering.

$1.5 million to advance the formulation and clinical development efforts in their MEAI patented compounds.  
$1.0 million to complete the pre-IND enabling studies and IND submission.  
$3.5 million to complete their planned Phase I/IIa studies.  
Remainder for working capital &amp; general corporate purposes &amp; possible in-licensing of intellectual property for new product candidates.

3035,StockMarket,"First off I'm not a trader at all. I go the boring IRA route. My question is a curious one since I've been a longtime computer aided designer and Autodesk (ADSK) has been my platform that my career has led me on. I own a small design firm and have 12 employees and we all use Autodesk software and I have seen our industry propel into areas that have pretty much locked in Autodesk as the leader. 

The only direct competitor I know of in the AEC space is Bentley Systems (BSY). There's also Dassault Systemes (DSY.PA) but it's hard to put them in the competitive space against Autodesk as they stand alone at the top in their industry and I haven't seen anything dethroning them (CATIA, SolidWorks). 

The VDC and BIM industries have really grabbed ahold in recent years (VDC = Virtual Design and Construction, BIM = Building Information Modeling). This is Autodesk's crown jewel. Recently, their flagship Revit platform is basically supreme for architects, engineers and now (very recently) contractors and all of your prefabrication processes are starting to use the Revit platform as the standard. There's a bit of a renaissance emerging for Autodesk in this area... ask anybody who was a designer 10 years ago and they were disgusted with them, but they listened to their users and hired a mega software team apparently and I will admit vast improvements have come forth, especially in the MEP prefab database merger from the old TSI / MAP Software they bought up in the early 2010's. This gave them the ultimate monopoly so to speak, but since there are real contenders in the prefab space it won't necessarily knock them off. 

Anyways, I'm rambling a bit but wanted to set the landscape. My question is: Why is ADSK's stock seem to be so volatile when in the AEC space (AEC = Architectural, Engineering and Construction) they really are the most popular software platform, and they continue to develop tools that really push the industry forward, gaining momentum in all facets of the industry? I've only known of some companies finding some cheaper alternatives in some specific software platforms but not their flagships - those are pretty much here to stay. They are also in the visuals/CGI space (3DS Max, Maya, etc) and from what I know their users are not real happy with Autodesk buying up and owning this software. 

Has anybody really looked into ADSK as a real stock investment? Just curious to know someone's thoughts. And if you haven't, curious to know why if you overlooked it. Thanks!",Curious regarding Autodesk versus other competitors?,1669351166

3039,StockMarket,"The market in 2023 will have no shortage of challenges: the Russian-Ukrainian war may be at a stalemate, the global economy may stagnate and fall into recession, and high inflation is bound to persist. But for Amunicio, the European asset management giant, there are plenty of investment opportunities as valuations for some assets become more attractive.

Amundi said in a 2023 outlook report that the Fed could raise interest rates to 5.25% before a pause in March next year, and its possible policy shift would help support U.S. stocks and U.S. bonds, reviving the historic 60/40 investment strategy.

On a trade-weighted basis, the dollar is expected to depreciate by 4.7%, which bodes well for stocks and some emerging market assets, while above-target inflation will boost demand for real assets such as infrastructure and real estate.

Amundi said: ""This is a 'half-full glass'. 2023 will be a year of double-speed growth, and many risks need to be paid attention to. Bond investment opportunities are emerging again, and valuations are getting higher and higher."" Attractive. If the Fed turns around in the first half of next year, that could trigger a better buying point. ""

The global economy will remain challenging, with central banks likely to stop raising interest rates abruptly, while the ongoing cost of living crisis will dent growth. Amundi expects GDP in advanced economies to grow just 0.3% in 2023, compared with 2.6% this year; growth in the US will drop sharply from 1.9% to 0.8%. The energy crisis will become the main economic problem in Europe, and the region may fall into recession. Global inflation may have peaked, but could still run above target next year.

In addition, geopolitical pressure will be another headwind. While Amondi's base case is a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine in the second half of next year, there is also a 25 percent chance that the conflict will escalate into a military confrontation between Russia and the West.

Still, these risks don't necessarily spell another bad year for all assets. Amundi forecasts high-single-digit returns for U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds and the S&amp;P 500. The positive factor is that interest rates in various countries are close to their peaks, and the Federal Reserve may pause interest rate hikes when interest rates fall. At 5.25%, the ECB and BoE rates peaked at 2.5% and 4.5%, respectively.

Amundi says: Play defensively early in your asset allocation, but be prepared to adjust throughout the year. The stock market will provide a buying point during the year, which could lead to a sharp reversal in positioning if it bottoms out in 2023.

Some thoughts from the company on the market in 2023:

‚óèBe optimistic about US high-grade credit bonds and emerging market hard currency bonds, not junk bonds.

‚óè Positive views on US Treasuries, especially amid hurting corporate profits and deteriorating geopolitics.

‚óèThe stock market may further adjust, and it is necessary to act cautiously at the beginning of next year.

‚óè Optimistic about US stocks and defensive stocks. Investors should be ready to add to European and Chinese equities by the end of the year.","Asset management giant: The Fed is expected to stop raising interest rates in March next year, and there are investment opportunities in stocks and bonds",1669348013

3071,StockMarket,"The Bahamas-based exchange run by Sam Bankman-Fried, a prominent voice who spent millions on lobbying US lawmakers, came under the radar for the risky businesses that the company did in the US. With the scene set, let's have a look at what happened at FTX and how did the house of cards that it built came tumbling down.

**The backroom scene**

FTX did risky transactions that aren‚Äôt legal in the United States. The cash stream flowing through their books remained unconstrained by regulatory requirements. Alameda Research, a company owned by Fried. FTX has a native cryptocurrency they birthed from thin air called FTT, used by traders to pay transaction fees.

On November 2nd, Coindesk started reporting that $5.8 billion of Alameda Research's $14.6 billion of assets on their balance sheet were linked to FTX's exchange token, FTT that was used as collateral in further loans.

**The after effect**

Following days of speculation, Binance, one of the biggest crypto exchange, announced that it would be selling its FTT holdings worth $500 million in light of the ""recent revelations"".

Within a span of 72 hours on November 8th FTX saw $6 billion in withdrawals and had a balance of one bitcoin. The next day, Binance promised to bail out FTX but on November 10th it decided to walk away after discoveries in corporate due diligence, reports of mishandling funds and regulatory investigations in the US.

**The Ripple effect**

After days of seeing its reputation plummeted to the ground. On November 11th, FTX filed for bankruptcy and its CEO resigned. This was nothing short of a crypto version of the infamous 2008 crash of the Lehman Brothers

The news triggered shockwaves in an already volatile crypto market and further destroyed the confidence of investors and sped up the need for regulations. Not only this, Bitcoin also was dealt a blow when it saw a dip from $20k to around $16K, its lowest valuation since 2020.

As scared investors pull out their funds from the crypto market, the ripple effects will continue. JPMorgan predicts that bitcoin could fall to $13,000, a decline of nearly 22% from where it stands today.

**What now for the web3/Crypto industry?**

Well, a push for regulation might just be the injection needed to help restore its credibility and reliability.

3079,StockMarket,"A 56% drop in 2008 set the stage for a 270% rally in the ensuing 12 months, and while past performance is no guarantee of future performance, a sharp rebound is likely given Amazon's dominance in cloud computing and e-commerce Sex cannot be ignored.

&amp;#x200B;

In July, Barron's wrote a bullish article on Amazon, arguing that the company's cloud business AWS has huge long-term value. But the company's shares have fallen 25% since July as investors fretted about the near-term growth prospects of Amazon's core e-commerce business and AWS.

&amp;#x200B;

While these concerns are understandable, Amazon remains a long-term stock.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

AWS revenue growth has slowed faster than expected, with analysts now expecting 25% revenue growth for the business in the fourth quarter of this year, down from 40% a year earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

But as Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion wrote in a recent research report, AWS has a market share of more than 50% in the cloud computing market and is expected to exceed $100 billion in revenue by 2023. close. That's more than three times as fast as Salesforce (CRM), which is growing at half the rate of AWS. If Salesforce is used as a reference, Amazon's cloud business would be worth more than half of Amazon's current market value of about $940 billion, and the value of that business will continue to grow.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, Amazon's core business, e-commerce, continues to grab market share, but consumers are spending less amid macro factors such as rising inflation, high interest rates and a potential recession.

&amp;#x200B;

Revenue from Amazon's online store business fell 3% in the first quarter, 4% in the second, and returned to 7% growth in the third. Wall Street analysts are expecting revenue for the business to be flat year-over-year for the holiday season, which appears to be a worrying forecast as most forecasts point to at least a small increase in overall revenue for the online store industry during the holiday shopping season.

&amp;#x200B;

But the online store is only part of the story of Amazon's e-commerce growth. The company has a vast warehouse and delivery infrastructure that powers its third-party seller services business, as well as a growing advertising division that helps Amazon sellers draw attention to their wares. By 2023, third-party revenue will reach $125 billion, and advertising revenue will exceed $44 billion, more than a third of the size of the Meta Platforms (META) advertising business.

&amp;#x200B;

During the pandemic, Amazon has doubled its workforce to more than 1.5 million since the end of 2019 as it aggressively built out its platform. The company recently changed its strategy, laying off staff and closing some warehouses.

&amp;#x200B;

MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Norton recently started covering companies in the e-commerce space. He noted that since 2001, online shopping has grown from 1 percent to 14 percent of the U.S. retail market. Norton sees this trend continuing, saying: ""It's more convenient and often cheaper for consumers to shop online.""

&amp;#x200B;

Norton recommended only one stock in his research report, Amazon, which he believes is undervalued in its e-commerce business.

&amp;#x200B;

Norton believes that Amazon is gradually turning things around and refocusing on its cost structure. He estimates that Amazon is about to reap the rewards of the $81 billion the company has spent on logistics and transportation infrastructure from 2020 to 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

Norton pointed to an improvement in its logistics business as Amazon reined in costs. He expects the company's spending on logistics and transportation to fall to $10 billion in 2025, from $25 billion this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Norton believes that Wall Street is overestimating Amazon's capital expenditures and underestimating free cash flow. Lower operating leverage and additional spending controls are expected to push 2023 pretax profit 18% above Wall Street's forecast and 9% above the 2024 consensus estimate, he said.

&amp;#x200B;

Norton expects Amazon to earn $1.93 a share next year, well above Wall Street's $1.68. He expects pretax margins to hit 4.8% next year and 6.7% in 2024, up from Wall Street's forecast of 2.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

""Better-than-expected profits and lower capital intensity have been good for valuations,"" Norton said. ""Three years of Amazon's valuation squeeze, lower pre-tax profit expectations, and higher-than-expected capital intensity, I think that's about to change,"" Norton said. .""

&amp;#x200B;

Amazon's stock has fallen about 50% since its November 2021 peak, losing nearly $1 trillion in market value in the process. But as Piper Sandler analyst Champion pointed out, a 56% drop in 2008 set the stage for a 270% rise in the ensuing 12 months, and while past performance is no guarantee of future performance, given Amazon's role in cloud computing And the dominance of the e-commerce sector, the possibility of a sharp rebound in stock prices cannot be ignored.","After losing nearly 1 trillion market value, Amazon is about to start a rebound",1669296658

3097,StockMarket,"2022 has been a year of soaring global inflation and a global market meltdown due to supply chain issues, the Russia-Ukraine war, high energy prices, a commodities supercycle, a super-hawkish Federal Reserve, rising global interest rates, risk-off trade sentiment.

&amp;#x200B;

The S&amp;P 500 is down about 17%, the Dow is down 7.1%, the Nasdaq is down 28.8%, and the Russell 2000 is down 17.6% this year (through November 18, 2022).

&amp;#x200B;

Against this backdrop, below we highlight a few ETF areas that have bucked the trend and emerged as winners.

&amp;#x200B;

Energy

&amp;#x200B;

Credit Suisse S&amp;P MLP Index ETN (MLPO) rose 118.2%

Invesco Dynamic Energy Exploration &amp; Production ETF (PXE) rose 79.2%

&amp;#x200B;

Oil prices have been trending well recently, with the WTI Crude ETF U.S. Oil Fund LP (USO) up 25% this year, largely due to a recovery in demand from geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe, OPEC+ production cuts, and the reopening of the economy. Prices rose sharply after OPEC+ producers agreed on October 5 to slash output in a bid to stimulate a recovery in crude oil prices, despite repeated calls from the administration of U.S. President Biden to increase output from the group to lower fuel prices and curb global inflation.

&amp;#x200B;

Interest Rate Hedging ETFs

&amp;#x200B;

Simplify Interest Rate Hedge ETF (PFIX) up 83.8%

Advocate Rising Rate Hedge ETF (RRH) up 39.1%

&amp;#x200B;

The interest rate hedging corner of the fixed income market has recently become an area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest due to rising interest rates. Investors flocked to PFIX and RRH to counter rising interest rate concerns. The Fed has raised interest rates sharply this year. Atlanta Fed President Rafael Bostic recently said he would be happy to back off a 75 basis point rate hike at the next meeting, but announced rates could hit 4.75%-5 before the Fed completes its current tightening cycle %.

&amp;#x200B;

Defensive ETFs

&amp;#x200B;

KFA Mount Lucas Managed Futures Index Strategy ETF (KMLM) rose 32.3%

AGFiQ US Market Neutral Anti-Beta Fund (BTAL) up 15.2%

&amp;#x200B;

Defensive investing has gained momentum as risk-off trade sentiment has prevailed this year. Concerns about rising interest rates are widespread across the globe. And that concern is unlikely to go away anytime soon. Therefore, stock market volatility will continue for some time. Therefore, investors may consider alternative assets to protect their portfolios from volatility.

&amp;#x200B;

Commodity

&amp;#x200B;

iPath Series B Bloomberg Nickel Subindex Total Return ETN (JJN) up 24.7%

iShares U.S. ETF Trust iShares GSCI Commodity Dynamic Roll Strategy ETF (COMT) rose 21.2%

&amp;#x200B;

After a decade of underperformance, commodities are experiencing a massive rebound due to the Russia-Ukraine war, high inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and pent-up demand following widespread vaccinations. Commodities, from crude oil to metals to crops, are doing well in 2022 as investors bet on inflation expectations and focus on everything that can be a hedge against inflation. In particular, agricultural markets have been an area of ‚Äã‚Äãconcern lately, given concerns about the growing global food crisis and rising prices.

&amp;#x200B;

Dividends

&amp;#x200B;

Invesco S&amp;P Ultra Dividend Revenue ETF (RDIV) rose 9.2%

WisdomTree US High Dividend Fund (DHS) rose 8.6%

&amp;#x200B;

Companies that pay dividends are generally good for value investing and are popular when volatility increases. Investors have two options in this space -- one for steady dividend growth (or Dividend Aristocrats), and one for high yield. Companies that regularly raise their dividends appear to be more stable than those that offer higher yields. But if anything, high-yield ones can also largely make up for capital losses.

3101,StockMarket,"* **Opendoor CEO Eric Wu says the company's algorithm didn't predict housing market shifting so quickly.**
* **The quick market shifts rivaled those of the housing crisis of 2008, he said.**
* **The company posted third-quarter losses of over $400 million**

Opendoor cofounder and CEO, Eric Wu, points to the unprecedented events in the housing market over the last few years as to why his company's algorithm missed the mark.¬†

""We've seen a once-in-a-40-year move in home prices on top of a move in velocity that we've actually never seen in housing,"" Wu told Ben Thompson of Stratechery during a podcast interview.

The sharp changes in the market have been costly to Opendoor's business model.

Home-flipping giant Opendoor buys homes from sellers and uses technology and data to alleviate the hassles of the home-selling process for users.

However, the steep moves in home-price appreciation, specifically, stumped Opendoor's algorithm, according to Wu, and stalled any momentum the company had to finish 2022.

The 2014-founded company relies heavily on past housing data to help accurately price homes and make future predictions. Opendoor's forecast did factor in higher interest rates, according to Wu, but not for home price appreciation to shift alongside it.¬†

**""Given the shift in the market, we certainly made a forecasting prediction that has not been accurate about the slope of the change in the past three months,""** Wu said.¬†""We were pricing in the interest rate movements"" but didn't also account for the dramatic shift in home prices, he said.

According to Wu, Opendoor tested previous market conditions, but the speed of the most-recent shift was far greater than previous shifts ‚Äî including the 2008 financial crisis.

""**We did have models that said that's possible, but we didn't say it was likely,""** Wu said. **""There was uncertainty about where the rates would end up and buyers just sat out. That was a shift that we hadn't seen before in any of the back testing and any of the data that we analyzed from previous home price depreciation, even the \[Great Financial Crisis\].**""

After this article's initial publication, Opendoor reached out to Insider to clarify that the company's ""forecasting prediction"" is based on their algorithm and human input.

Opendoor had a turbulent third quarter ‚Äî **cutting home prices** **to unload its inventory and** **laying off 550 employees****.**¬†

The company posted¬† **revenue of $3.4 billion in the third quarter, up 48% from the previous year, but had a gross loss of $425 million**, according to the company's earnings statement.

3109,StockMarket,"According to media reports citing sources from the German Ministry of Finance, the German government plans to impose a windfall profit tax of up to 33% on natural gas, oil and coal companies. The special tax is expected to bring in 1-3 billion euros in revenue.

The tax, called ""EU Energy Crisis Contribution"", will be implemented by the end of 2022, and the number of taxed companies is expected to reach double digits, according to people familiar with the matter. The new tax targets companies' profits in 2022 and 2023.

After the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as relations between Russia and the West deteriorated sharply, global fossil fuel prices soared, especially natural gas, from which energy companies generally made huge profits.

The draft document of the German Ministry of Finance shows that if the profits of gas, oil and coal companies and refineries this year and next exceed 20% of the average profits in 2018-2021, they will be levied windfall profits tax.

Germany also wants to extend the energy windfall tax to EU levels and is in talks to do so, the people added. Germany studied several methods of implementing the tax and chose the one with the least legal risk.

To be clear, the proposed tax is different from another tax announced by Germany on Tuesday, which applies to windfall profits in the power sector from Sept. 1, 2022, and will last until at least June 2023.

""The finance ministry's draft windfall tax for oil and gas companies falls far short of what is necessary,"" said Katharina Beck, a finance spokeswoman for Germany's Green party.

The current German government is governed by a coalition of three parties: the Social Democrats, the Green Party and the Free Democrats. The Green Party is a centre-left environmentalist party that promotes green politics but opposes nuclear energy.

The windfall tax on gas and oil should be between 60% and 80%, roughly equivalent to the 90% tax on the electricity sector, she added.

Energy companies may try to avoid taxes by shifting profits offshore, limiting tax revenue, Baker noted.","Germany plans to impose a 33% windfall profit tax on energy companies, but it is accused of not being high enough",1669256002

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 130 points, or 0.38%. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.70% and the Nasdaq Composite increased 1.10%.

Shares of Nordstrom fell more than 3% after the department store chain reaffirmed its forecast.

Meeting minutes from the Fed‚Äôs November meeting signaled that the central bank is seeing progress in its fight against high inflation and is looking to slow the pace of rate hikes, meaning smaller ones through the end of this year and into 2023.

‚ÄúA substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,‚Äù the minutes stated. ‚ÄúThe uncertain lags and magnitudes associated with the effects of monetary policy actions on economic activity and inflation were among the reasons cited regarding why such an assessment was important.‚Äù

Earlier in November, the central bank approved a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point hike that brought rates to their highest level since 2008.

‚ÄúIn the market‚Äôs interpretation this is positive given that the Fed wants to see a rebalancing in the labor market whereby businesses begin to hold leverage over the demand for higher wages,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. ‚ÄúHigher wages have been consistently passed along as higher prices leading to rising inflationary pressures.‚Äù¬†

Jobless claims data came in higher than expected at 240,000 for the week ending Nov. 19 where economist expected 225,000, signaling that the labor market may be weakening. At the same time, however, durable goods orders for October were stronger than anticipated, coming in at 1%, more than the 0.5% expected.

Wall Street is coming off an upbeat session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging nearly 400 points Tuesday as traders shrugged off fears of further lockdowns in China and looked to strong earnings. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.36%, closing above the 4,000 level for the first time since September. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.36%.

3156,StockMarket,"Amazon.com Inc.¬†plans to spend more than $1 billion a year to produce movies that it will release¬†in theaters, according to people familiar with the company‚Äôs plans, the largest commitment to cinemas¬†by an internet company.

The world‚Äôs largest online retailer aims to make between 12 and 15 movies annually¬†that will get a theatrical release,¬†said the people, who asked not¬†to be identified because the company is still sorting through its strategy.¬†Amazon will release a smaller number of films in theaters next year and increase its output over time. That number of releases puts it on on a par with major studios such as Paramount Pictures.

Streaming services have eschewed theaters with most of their original movies, or released the titles for less time and on fewer screens than traditional movie studios. Netflix Inc. in particular has aggravated cinema chains by releasing more than a movie a week for viewers at home. The streaming giant released a sequel to¬†*Knives Out*¬†¬†in theaters on Wednesday. It will stay there for just one week, however, before heading to streaming next month. The original film grossed $312.9¬†million theatrically in 2019.

Amazon has been more open to theaters than Netflix, but has yet to invest as much money in original movies. While Netflix releases close to 100 movies a year,¬†Amazon puts out just¬†a couple dozen, many in languages other than English.

 ‚ÄúAmazon.com‚Äôs plans to invest $1 billion to produce 12-15 movies a year for release in cinemas is a vote of confidence in the theatrical model,‚Äù Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan wrote Wednesday in a note. It could ‚Äúeasily boost receipts by 15%-20% given Universal and Warner have roughly similar budgets.‚Äù 

The news lifted shares of theater operators. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., the largest chain, rose as much as 9.2% to $7.99 in New York. Cinemark Holdings Inc. advanced as much as 12% to $13.78. 

Even though Amazon is in a cost-cutting mode, the company is ramping up its investment in original movies following the $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM, a 98-year-old¬†Hollywood studio that¬†released¬†*Ben-Hur*¬†and¬†*Legally Blonde.* Its franchises include¬†*Rocky* and James Bond, which it releases in conjunction with the family of producer Albert Broccoli. MGM‚Äôs two top film executives, Michael¬†DeLuca and Pam Abdy, left Amazon just a month after it acquired the¬†company, and Amazon Studios chief Jennifer Salke has been looking for an executive to run the film business.

Salke‚Äôs boss, Mike Hopkins, met with candidates including Emma Watts, formerly of Fox and Paramount, and Sean Bailey, an executive at Walt Disney Co. But Salke has taken control of the¬†search for the job, which will now report to her instead of Hopkins.

Amazon first got the attention of the movie business by acquiring projects at the Sundance Film Festival and releasing them in thousands of theaters for months, a cycle that resembled those of a traditional studio. It earned Academy Award nominations for *The Big Sick* and *Manchester by the Sea.* While those movies delighted critics, they were only modest successes at the box office.

Salke went on a buying spree of her own at Sundance in 2019 after taking the helm of Amazon‚Äôs Hollywood operations. But Amazon shifted its release strategy to prioritize its streaming service.

Founder Jeff Bezos has also pushed his Hollywood studio to develop and release more commercial material, which led to the recent *The Lord¬†of the Rings* TV series, as well as projects like *The Terminal List,* a show¬†starring Chris Pratt. All of the streaming companies, including Netflix and Apple, have invested more money in original TV before progressing to film.

Theaters will welcome the new product from Amazon, whenever it comes. US ticket sales are down more than 33% from 2019, the last full year before the pandemic closed theaters. Many of the biggest movie studios are part of companies that have started releasing original movies online to boost their streaming services.

Yet despite declining ticket sales, filmmakers, Hollywood veterans and talent representatives are all pushing for media companies to embrace theaters. They believe a big hit in theaters, such as *Top Gun: Maverick*, is more lucrative than even the biggest streaming movie.

* Musk wants to vastly increase the amount of money the company makes through subscriptions while opening up the site to more ‚Äúfree speech.‚Äù
* This creates a risk that Twitter could violate Apple or Google‚Äôs app rules in a way that slows down the company or even gets its software booted from app stores.
* Battle lines are being drawn. Last week, Musk complained about app store fees, which are between 15% and 30% of digital sales, in a tweet.

Elon Musk has announced big, albeit confusing, plans for Twitter since he took over the social network last month.

Musk wants to vastly increase the revenue the company makes through subscriptions while opening up the site to more ‚Äúfree speech,‚Äù which in some cases seems to mean restoring previously banned accounts like the one owned by former president Donald Trump.

But Musk‚Äôs plans for Twitter could put it in conflict with two of the biggest tech companies: Apple and Google.

Tensions are brewing

One of the biggest risks to Musk‚Äôs vision for ‚ÄúTwitter 2.0‚Äù is the possibility that his changes violate Apple or Google‚Äôs app rules in a way that slows down the company or even gets its software booted from app stores.

Tensions are already brewing. Musk complained in a tweet just last week about app store fees that Google and Apple charge companies like Twitter.

‚ÄúApp store fees are obviously too high due to the iOS/Android duopoly,‚Äù Musk tweeted. ‚ÄúIt is a hidden 30% tax on the Internet.‚Äù In a follow-up post, he tagged the Department of Justice‚Äôs antitrust division, which is reportedly investigating app store rules.

His complaint is over the 15% to 30% cut Apple and Google take from purchases made inside apps, which could eat into the desperately-needed revenue from Musk‚Äôs plans for $8 per month from Twitter Blue subscriptions.

Over the weekend, Phil Schiller, the former head Apple marketing executive who still oversees the App Store, apparently deleted his widely-followed Twitter account with hundreds of thousands of followers.

3171,StockMarket,"Tesla shares have shed more than $700 billion in market value since peaking in early November of last year, but analysts now suggest the carmaker is poised for a comeback.

Tesla¬† (**TSLA**) shares moved firmly higher Wednesday after analysts at Citigroup lifted their rating on the clean-energy carmaker while Morgan Stanley noted that the stock's $500 billion slump maybe coming to an end.

Citigroup analyst Itay Michaeli lifted his rating on Tesla to 'neutral' from 'sell', while boosting his price target by around $35 to $176 per share, arguing the stock's year-to-date decline of around 58% has ""balanced out the near-term risk/reward"" for Tesla investors.

""To be sure, macro/competitive concerns are likely to remain an overhang with capacity rising, but as we‚Äôve previously written, in a hard landing scenario Tesla‚Äôs long-term competitive position likely also improves and potentially further enhanced by (President Joe Biden's inflation reduction act),"" Michaeli wrote.¬†

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, meanwhile, said Tesla shares are ""approaching our $150 bear case, driven by price cuts in China, decelerating EV demand and other market currents.""¬†

Jonas, who carries an 'overweight' rating with a $330 price target on Tesla stock, said that while the ongoing distraction of CEO Elon Musk's foray into Twitter will likely expose investors to added risks, the group remains on pace to grow sales by around 37% next year, generate $15 billion in free-cash-flow and consolidate its position as the word's dominant EV player.

""We believe Tesla's 'gap-to-competition' can potentially widen, particularly as EV prices pivot from inflationary to deflationary,"" Jonas wrote. ""With respect to the (inflation reduction act) we believe Tesla is by far the best positioned OEM in terms of potential eligibility for consumer tax and production credits.""

* Google employees say there‚Äôs growing anxiety internally that layoffs may be coming.
* A recent change in performance reviews along with increased chatter about cuts to travel budgets and swag is contributing to the concern.
* Google is coming off its weakest quarter for revenue growth since 2013, other than one period during the pandemic.

As industry-wide layoffs hit bigger tech names, some Google workers worry they‚Äôre next.

While Google has so far avoided the widespread job cuts that have hit tech companies, particularly those supported by a slumping ad market, internal anxiety is on the rise, according to documents viewed by CNBC and employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Alphabet executives have stressed the need to sharpen ‚Äúfocus,‚Äù bring down costs of projects and make the company 20% more efficient. There‚Äôs also been a recent change in performance reviews, and some employees point to declining travel budgets and less swag as signs that something bigger may be on the horizon.

In July, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai launched the ‚ÄúSimplicity Sprint‚Äù in an effort to bolster efficiency during an uncertain economic environment. Just a few miles up the road, Meta told employees this month that it‚Äôs laying off 13% of its staff, or more than 11,000 employees, as the company reckons with declining ad revenue. Snap announced a 20% cut in August, and Twitter just slashed about half its workforce under the leadership of new owner Elon Musk. Elsewhere in Silicon Valley, HP said on Tuesday it plans to lay off 4,000 to 6,000 employees over the next three years.

Google‚Äôs business hasn‚Äôt been hit as hard as many of its peers, but the combination of a potential recession, soaring inflation and rising interest rates is having a clear impact. Last month, the company said YouTube‚Äôs ad revenue shrank from a year earlier as Google generated its weakest period of growth since 2013, other than one quarter during the pandemic. Google said at the time that it would significantly reduce headcount growth in the fourth quarter.

The crypto market, which put a dent in Google‚Äôs latest results, has fallen even further with the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, leading to increased concerns about industry contagion.

Jobless claims data came in higher than expected at 240,000 for the week ending Nov. 19 where economist expected 225,000, signaling that the labor market may be weakening. At the same time, however, durable goods orders for October were stronger than anticipated, coming in at 1%, more than the 0.5% expected.

Investors are awaiting the latest Fed meeting minutes, due Wednesday afternoon, for insight into the central bank‚Äôs approach on monetary policy ahead of the December meeting.

Earlier in November, the central bank approved a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point hike that brought rates to their highest level since 2008. Economists are forecasting a half percentage point increase in December, and smaller rate hikes next year.

Wall Street is coming off an upbeat session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging nearly 400 points Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.36%, closing above the 4,000 level for the first time since September. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.36%.

* Judge Davila says ‚Äòfamily visitation enhances rehabilitation‚Äô

Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes will wake up at 6 am, will have her choice of three subdued colors of clothing, and will be well above the average age of her fellow inmates **if she ends up serving her 11 1/4-year prison sentence at a minimum-security women‚Äôs facility outside Houston as recommended by her judge.**

US District Judge Edward Davila proposed the federal prison camp in Bryan, Texas, according to a court filing, even though Holmes has been living in northern California, where she ran her blood-testing startup for almost 15 years before it collapsed and she was indicted in 2018.

‚ÄúThe Court finds that family visitation enhances rehabilitation,‚Äù the judge wrote in the filing, which summarized the terms of the sentence Davila imposed on Holmes last week at a hearing in San Jose, California. The final decision on where Holmes is incarcerated rests with the US Bureau of Prisons. Davila ordered her to surrender herself into custody by April 27.

As prisons go, it‚Äôs a good draw, said Alan Ellis, a criminal defense lawyer. It‚Äôs a standalone facility, he said, while explaining that unlike some other women‚Äôs facilities, it doesn‚Äôt share any staff or management with a nearby men‚Äôs prison. For that reason, staff members don‚Äôt suffer from a ‚Äúprison mentality,‚Äù and are more ‚Äúopen-minded,‚Äù he said. Ellis said Holmes‚Äôs lawyers likely requested the location.

Holmes will face ‚Äúno walls, no bars, no fences,‚Äù Ellis said. ‚ÄúNo one wants to get gets kicked out because compared to other places in the prison system, this place is heaven. If you have to go it‚Äôs a good place to go.‚Äù

Like other federal prison camps, the facility in Bryan has dormitory housing and a low staff-to-inmate ratio and is ‚Äúwork and program oriented,‚Äù according to the Bureau of Prisons. Bryan is about 100 miles northwest of Houston.

Legal experts predicted Holmes would likely serve her time at a facility in Dublin, California, about 35 miles east of San Francisco. Court filings indicate that her parents own a condominium in Washington, DC. Holmes is known to have grown up in Houston. She and her partner, Billy Evans, have a 16-month old boy and she was visibly pregnant at her sentencing hearing.

According to Pink Lady, a prison consultant company, the Bryan prison camp houses about 900 white-collar, non-violent female inmates, most of them serving time for embezzlement and a variety of frauds. Prison Insight, a website dedicated to exposing what it describes as the ‚Äúbroken‚Äù US prison system, says the average age of inmates at Bryan is 32 years.

Programs offered at the facility include accounting technology, cosmetology, horticulture, medical transcription and coding, and small business management.

1)Compare October 2022 to October 2021. Huge drop in existing home sales!

2)Prices of existing homes are higher than in 2021 despite the massive increase in interest rates

https://i.postimg.cc/LXMxxk70/image.png

3)Pending home sales uses an index number. The base year for the index is 2001 and 100 represents the pending home sales in 2001. Anything under 100 means that we are below the base year. We‚Äôre at 79.5, this is very low right now.

https://i.postimg.cc/D0x5f9zt/image.png

4)I showed this to you all earlier. It‚Äôs basically saying that the median family income is lower than the income required to qualify for a loan. Thus, housing is unaffordable. The index number is calculated by dividing median family income by loan qualifying income and multiplying by 100. Under 100 means unaffordable.

5)This information comes from national association of Home Builders and essentially is a survey that‚Äôs testing home builder sentiment. They put this in an index number and essentially anything below 50 is poor sentiment and anything above 50 is positive sentiment

**Introduction**

I've been really into the precious metals market for the last couple of years. I followed the history of money, specifically gold, and was impressed. Aris Mining was a holding in a junior mining ETF and I wanted to learn more. Aris Mining both operates its own properties while exploring. I think there's a lot of potential in the precious metals market, and I'm excited to see where it goes in the future. 

https://preview.redd.it/vpe657ymfl1a1.png?width=240&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16fd3d5bada0a83ff90954a5c51e66cb1d0b2f03

**Operating Mines**

***Segovia***

The Segovia Operations are located 180 kilometres northeast of Medell√≠n in the Segovia-Remedios mining district of Antioquia, Colombia. Segovia is a multi-million-ounce high-grade gold operation that has been producing gold for more than 150 years. The area is rich in gold deposits, and Segovia has been able to take advantage of this natural resource to create a successful and long-running business. The company is committed to responsible mining practices, and works to minimise its environmental impact. Segovia is a major contributor to the local economy, and provides employment for many people in the area.

https://preview.redd.it/udmr8yryfl1a1.png?width=536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b7508ab24a78415c88295a7a0005bd77f7c36d66

***Marmato***

The Marmato gold district has been mined since pre-Colonial times by the Quimbaya people. The gold resource was so significant that Simon Bolivar, the revolutionary leader who liberated much of South America from Spanish rule, used the gold as collateral with British banks to secure funding for his war efforts. In more recent times, the Marmato gold district has been extensively mined by large-scale commercial operations, and is currently estimated to contain over $20 billion worth of gold reserves. 

**Exploration Project**

The Juby Project is an advanced exploration-stage gold project located in Ontario, Canada, 100 kilometres south-southeast of the Timmins gold camp within the Shining Tree area in the southern part of the Abitibi greenstone belt.¬† 

The Juby Project has excellent access to infrastructure including a major highway, a power transmission line that passes through the property, and an abundance of water in the region. The regional geological setting at Juby is similar to that of the Kirkland Lake and Timmins gold camps and is largely underexplored.

**Dividend History**

The most impressive part in my books is the dividend history that Aris has. Currently as i write this post, Aris has a forward dividend yield of 5.26% at $0.18 per share. That is higher than all of its previous dividends of $0.15. Having an increase during all the turmoil speaks great volumes. Their earnings were fabulous which allowed them to do the increase. This is an incredible dividend in any market across the entire world, let alone such a ""minor"" industry as mining.

**Final Thoughts**

To be clear, I don't have any shares in Aris, but that might change in the future the way this company is headed. There are so many good aspects its hard to find any negative ones. They have producer that's creating an insane profit margin that's essentially 50% while spending capital on developing and exploring other sites. I can't wait to see what happens when they get the others online as well.

Also this isn't directed at people who sell stock from a company that is literally going bankrupt or going to zero. So with that in mind, (I know my question sounded like a stupid one) but why do people sell the stocks they buy that have gone down? I have talked to friends who have invested $50 into the market, seen the share they invested in drop by 10% and then sell it and instantly lose money because they were not patient? I was also talking to my aunt who invested in CGC last year, her investment went down by like 30% or something and she just sold it but then bought into  the stock again this year after prices went back up? I am not sure if I am illustrating my point correctly but why are people so impatient with the stocks they buy? Also for those way more experienced then me is there like a general rule of thumb for when to sell a stock that I am missing because to me it just does not make sense. Any help would be appreciated because I can not tell if this post makes sense or seems ignorant",Why do people sell stocks that go down?,1669142478

Due to the interest rate increase in the US dollar, the stocks I invested have been losing money, and the loss even reached 30%, and I almost collapsed. Fortunately, I bought GGE in October. Here I would like to thank my friend James. It was his recommendation that made me profitable. I can't believe it until now. My investment in GGE is more than 60% profitable, really thank you James again, thank God!!!

3262,StockMarket,"Texas is investigating celebrities who had endorsed FTX, the now bankrupt cryptocurrency firm, for potentially violating state securities laws.

The Texas State Securities Board started looking into FTX‚Äôs operations last month over whether the exchange‚Äôs yield-bearing crypto accounts were providing residents with unregistered securities. Since the company‚Äôs collapse on Nov. 11, the board has[ ](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/11/21/texas-crypto-blockchain-ftx-bankruptcy/)significantly expanded its probe to examine the impact of this multibillion-dollar bankruptcy.

And promotions of FTX by celebrities such as the Golden State Warriors‚Äô Steph Curry and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers‚Äô Tom Brady are now part of this broadened investigation.

It also comes amid a class-action lawsuit filed in Florida against Curry, Brady and other celebrities ‚Äî mostly high-profile athletes ‚Äî which alleges that FTX had used their endorsements as part of a scheme designed to take advantage of ‚Äúunsophisticated investors.‚Äù It also names FTX‚Äôs former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.

‚ÄúAnyone who renders investment advice in Texas typically needs to be registered and they typically have to truthfully disclose all known material facts,‚Äù said Joe Rotunda, the state board‚Äôs enforcement director. ‚ÄúIn Texas, there is not a different system of justice or regulation for people who are celebrities.‚Äù

It‚Äôs currently unclear if any prominent Texan would be investigated, but Rotunda said his team is still compiling a list of relevant parties based on recent court filings by FTX‚Äôs current CEO John J. Ray III and the class-action lawsuit. In particular, it will be looking at what the promoters disclosed, how they were compensated and how their promotions were scripted and filmed.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important from a securities regulation standpoint, and from a bankruptcy standpoint, to determine the ways FTX was encouraging clients and Texans to use FTX and invest with FTX,‚Äù he said.

3266,StockMarket,"Anyone who has been following the VIX knows that it's not acting normal right now.

Since markets bottomed in March 2009, the S&amp;P 500 and the VIX have consistently maintained an inverse correlation, with the volatility index typically drifting steadily lower as equities powered to new highs (think 2017, when the VIX fell into single digits amid steady stock market gains) while bouts of volatility and short-lived selloffs in the stock market saw the VIX spike higher. Digging into this relationship deeper, when stocks made new meaningful lows below exceptional support levels, the VIX would almost always rise to new highs beyond those that corresponded with the previous lows in stocks.¬†

For example, as the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) dropped below the lows from late 2018 (2,346) during the Q1 ‚Äô20 Covid-19 crash, which carried the index down to 2,191, the VIX blasted through the late-2018 high of 36.20 and peaked at a staggering 85.47. The uncertainty associated with the first pandemic in 100 years certainly amplified the move higher in the VIX in that example, but it does illustrate the point of the traditional inverse correlation between stocks and the VIX very well.

Now, the actual formula and process used to calculate the VIX is very complex and involves some high-level math, but in the simplest terms, the index measures price activity, mainly demand, in the options market. That is why in normal market conditions, the VIX rises amid increasing demand for puts as the broader stock market declines, and this is also the reason it is often referred to as the market's ‚Äúfear gauge.‚Äù

But at both of the most recent major market peaks that occurred in 2000 and then again in 2007/2008, that historically consistent inverse correlation between the stock market and the VIX broke down as new meaningful lows in the S&amp;P 500 were not met with new highs in the VIX. And it has happened again this year.¬†

**The logical question to ask here is: why would this happen?**

As stocks make new meaningful lows, as they first did in February, then again in May and June of this year, sophisticated investors were actually liquidating long-term, long equity positions as opposed to holding those positions and just adding hedges to manage risk and downside exposure.

So, what we are seeing in the VIX and the S&amp;P 500 right now is the same thing we saw in both 2000/2001 and 2007/2008 in the early stages of those respective bear markets. And the bad news is that this dynamic only persists during the ‚Äúdistribution phase‚Äù of market cycles when sophisticated investors are liquidating to retail investors attempting to ‚Äúbuy one more dip.‚Äù Once the VIX finally breaks the downtrend of ‚Äúlower highs‚Äù and begins to move meaningfully higher, the real breakdown and capitulation in stocks begin.

Looking at the dot-com bubble, the downtrend in the VIX was broken in September 2001, and the S&amp;P 500 proceeded to decline another 30% or so, as the VIX ripped higher, finally bottoming in late 2002. During the financial crisis, the VIX downtrend was not broken until September 2008, and the S&amp;P 500 fell another 47% to the March 2009 lows (of course, the VIX ripped higher as well).

[Not a perfect downtrend but we're still in the process of lower highs since January.  It fits the pattern of 2001\/2002 and 2007\/2008.](https://preview.redd.it/40naqh9jzi1a1.png?width=2500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfeb71a5a72ae0f6a2ba4ca08be492e9bc994297)",The VIX is Broken.

* That presents stock investors with a ""terrific buying opportunity,"" the investment chief told CNBC.
* US stocks have been turbulent this year as the Fed hikes interest rates to fight inflation.¬†

The S&amp;P 500 will hit a new a low early next year, presenting US stock investors with a chance to jump in and benefit, according to Morgan Stanley's top stock picker.

""You're going to make a new low some time in the first quarter, and that will be a terrific buying opportunity,"" the bank's CIO Mike Wilson said in a Sunday interview with CNBC.

""Because by the time we get to the end of next year, we'll be looking at 2024, when the earnings will actually be accelerating again,"" he added.

Wilson made an S&amp;P 500 price call of 3,900 for the end of 2023, adding that US stocks have a volatile path ahead as they approach the end of the current bear market.¬†

""I think we're in the final stages. But the final stages can be very challenging, right?"" he said.

Inflation, higher interest rates, and the threat of a US recession has suppressed investor appetite for stocks this year, and the benchmark stock index is down nearly 17% year-to-date. It closed out Friday with a 0.48% gain, but a loss for the week.¬†

The S&amp;P 500¬† slipped into bear market territory in June, as the Federal Reserve slammed the brakes on the US economy with aggressive interest rate hikes. It's trying to prevent 40-year high inflation, triggered in part due to Russia's war with Ukraine, from becoming entrenched.¬†

The Fed in 2022 has lifted the fed funds rate from 0% to a range of 3.75%-4%, including four consecutive, hefty hikes of 0.75 percentage points. Inflation eased somewhat in October, but the monthly headline rate of 7.7% exceeds the Fed's 2% target.¬†

&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday morning as worries over Covid cases in China kept investor sentiment in check.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 75 points, or 0.22%. S&amp;P 500 futures were 0.24% higher, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.16%. Shares of Best Buy popped 7.3% in premarket trading after the company hiked its 2023 fiscal outlook and beat earnings expectations.
*****
&gt; China saw its first deaths in the mainland from Covid since May over the weekend. It prompted fears among investors that the country could bring back restrictions meant to slow virus spread, which would hurt business.
*****
&gt; The news out of China pushed investors away from growth stocks Monday and toward defensive sectors like health care and utilities, said David Waddell, CEO of Waddell &amp; Associates. He said it also led to ‚Äúreflexive‚Äù U.S. dollar buying, which gave bond yields upward pressure.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúOn low volume days like today, the market gets Pavlovian,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you want to make sense of this market, watch the dollar.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off a down session, with the Dow losing 45 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slid 0.4% and 1.1%, respectively. Losses on the Dow were kept in check by a 6.3% gain in Disney following the return of Bob Iger as CEO.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, several Federal Reserve officials are set to speak, including Kansas City Fed President Esther George and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.
*****
&gt; Economic reports due out include the Philadelphia Fed‚Äôs nonmanufacturing business outlook survey and the Richmond Fed‚Äôs manufacturing index.
*****
&gt; Investors are also watching for earnings reports from Dollar Tree, Best Buy, HP and Nordstrom. The stock market will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and will close early on Friday.

* China‚Äôs No. 2 retailer touts common dream of owning a home

JD.com Inc. is slashing salaries for about 2,000 managers by 10% to 20% and diverting some of those savings toward a $1.4 billion employee benefits fund, **aligning China‚Äôs No. 2 online retailer with Xi Jinping‚Äôs ‚Äúcommon prosperity‚Äù campaign to share the wealth.**

**Billionaire JD.com founder Richard Liu will donate 100 million yuan ($14 million) of his own money toward staff welfare,** a person familiar with the matter said. China‚Äôs largest online retailer after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. will also set up a 10 billion yuan fund to provide staff with interest-free home loans, the person added, asking not to be identified because it hasn‚Äôt been publicized.

The moves emerged weeks after **Xi reiterated a drive toward common prosperity**, a concept that -- twinned with a sweeping crackdown on powerful internet firms -- **roiled** **markets in 2021 by pushing business leaders and cash-rich companies to explore ways to re-distribute wealth**. That effort receded from public view as Beijing sought stability in the run-up to the October Party Congress, where Xi secured a precedent-busting third term.

Xi is now expected to revitalize one of his signature policies, with uncertain outcomes for investors and China‚Äôs largest corporations. Beyond JD, senior executives across China‚Äôs $58 trillion financial system are also facing additional pay cuts as firms from investment banks to mutual funds weigh options to comply with Xi‚Äôs mantra.

**‚ÄúI hope this move can realize the dream of securing a house for all employees who have worked for more than five years,** including for our courier and customer service brothers,‚Äù Liu announced in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg News.

https://preview.redd.it/71oatalvog1a1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5352f6366d44c22052968b1681834677932fc9f0

**Under the common prosperity campaign, Xi‚Äôs administration sought to rein in ‚Äúdisorderly expansion of capital.‚Äù In response, wealthy tech entrepreneurs like Liu began giving back.**

**Pinduoduo Inc.\*\*\*\*, the fast-rising online commerce giant challenging Alibaba in the countryside, last year pledged its next $1.5 billion in profit to farmers‚Äô welfare.** **Tencent Holdings Ltd.** **said it will** **double** **the amount of money allocated toward social responsibility programs to about $15 billion. And Alibaba promised to commit 100 billion yuan over five years to** **support** **small companies. Meanwhile, tech billionaires from PDD‚Äôs Colin Huang to** **ByteDance Ltd.\*\*\*\*‚Äôs Zhang Yiming and** **Xiaomi Corp.\*\*\*\*‚Äôs Lei Jun donated vast sums to a plethora of causes.**

JD‚Äôs salary cuts follow a wave of job and cost reductions worldwide by companies struggling with a potential recession. The Chinese firm, which like Alibaba weathered two years of strict Covid controls that precipitated a downturn, last week reported an 11% rise in quarterly revenue. It‚Äôs riding out the slowdown better than Alibaba, the target of a bruising antitrust crackdown in 2021.

Liu stepped down this year as JD‚Äôs chief executive officer, joining other tech tycoons that exited top management roles after the internet crackdown. The entrepreneur will focus on longer-term strategies while mentoring younger management, JD said at the time. **He would also contribute to the revitalization of rural China, the firm said, a priority of Xi‚Äôs.**

Tiger Global, which pays Bain more than $100 million a year to research private companies, has now written down its $38 million FTX stake to zero, the people said. Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs oversight of a vast web of FTX-linked entities was one of the risks highlighted during the due-diligence process, but the money manager still believed it was a sound investment at the time, one of the people said.¬†

A representative for Chase Coleman‚Äôs Tiger Global declined to comment, and Bain didn‚Äôt immediately reply to messages seeking comment. ¬†

This month‚Äôs implosion of FTX has caused billions of dollars of potential losses for investors and sparked legal and regulatory probes. It also prompted questions about how warning signs were missed by institutional investors, including hedge funds and venture capital firms. Ontario Teachers‚Äô Pension Plan was among them, writing off its entire $95 million investment, while Sequoia Capital marked down its $214 million wager to zero.¬† 

Tiger Global‚Äôs FTX investment was a tiny portion of its $12.7 billion Private Investment Partners 15 fund. The firm first backed FTX in October 2021, when the crypto exchange was valued at $25 billion, and again in January at a $32.5 billion valuation, according to PitchBook data.

The FTX bet was one of 358 venture capital investments Tiger Global made last year, and one of 290 so far in 2022, according to PitchBook.¬†

3332,StockMarket," Hi Folks!

Credit for this rabbit hole I found myself going down goes to my brother-in-law Andre The Giant [u/Difficult\_Quality255](https://www.reddit.com/u/Difficult_Quality255/). White collar, white hat business analytics type. Thanksgiving dinners have been interesting since GME round 1. The following is his assessment. I'll add my contributions of fundamentals and TA/options at the bottom.

TLDR: Pantone will now require a subscription to use their color schemes in Adobe. Even for templates or images already made. $15/month for millions of users. Fundamentally, it leads it's industry=Bullish. TA = bullish. Analysts= Bullish. Way OTM call OI= Bullish. Tits=Jacked.

: Price Trajectory ‚Äì Danaher

It has come to my attention that Danaher is about to experience growth in earnings. You may have heard about Pantone moving to a subscription model to use its colors in Adobe products. This means that for color matching requirements of print shops, they will have to purchase this subscription for each active user to meet customers‚Äô demands. This affects more than just the print industry; housing designers and graphic artists will also be affected. It is important to note that the product already exists. They did not have to build digital color pallets, instead are now charging for a product that was initially free.

The number of adobe cloud service users is 21,000,000, according to Adobe, in 2021. The Subscription fee for Pantone is $15.00/month on top of the need to purchase new physical swatches as needed. We can assume that anywhere from 1%-80% of adobe users will require to purchase this subscription based on need or having images already built with Pantone‚Äôs colors. (For clarification, old images will not retain their colors and only be black and white. This is a forced update for adobe cloud users).

We could see anywhere from 260,000 subscriptions to 20,800,000 subscriptions. This will negligibly affect the COGS/Op Margin of Pantone‚Äôs Parent Company XRite/Danaher.

Total Adobe Cloud Customers 26000000

Customers Monthly Income Annual Income Percent of DHR Rev

1% Conversion 260,000 $3,900,000 $46,800,000 0.20%

80% Conversion 20800000 $312,000,000 $3,744,000,000 16.21%

Compared with the Direct Leverage Calculations below, we can see that a 16.21% change in Revenues will result in a 13.13% increase in EPS. This free revenue will also improve DHR‚Äôs ratios across the board depending on the actual conversion of the Pantone subscription. With enough of a push on calls and purchasing of stock, in combination with Danaher‚Äôs increased performance, I believe that the price will surge beyond $350.00.

Direct Leverage Calculations

2022 2021 Delta

Rev ($MM) 23102 21305 8.43%

EPS 6.76 6.33 6.79%

EBIT ($MM) 6234 5685 9.66%

    Results		 

DOL 1.14

DFL 0.70

DCL 0.81

Seems legit right? Moving forward with fundamentals and TA/Options

Fundamentals:

Company is a powerhouse without the incoming mass injection of cash from the color scheme going from free to subscription.

Revenue was 29.5 Billion in 2021, projected to increase by 4.4% for 2022 and 2023. The projection doesn't take into account the new subscription revenue.

Gross margin and operating cash yield has beat industry average 5 years in a row.

EPS beats 12 Qs in a row, all &gt;2%.

All this while paying a dividend.

Technicals:

On the daily candles, it had a false breakout of its expanding triangle last week, and has consolidated near the top with a green spinner. Could see a new breakout attempt this week. The range on this ticket is pretty wide for being a mega cap.

Options: Interesting things happening on the call side with way OTM before, but especially after the new year. OI at 370 and 380 strikes really caught my eye.

**‚ö†Ô∏èSUBMISSION DEADLINE: NOVEMBER 23, 2022‚ö†Ô∏è**

Here you can estimate your payout: [calculator](https://11thestate.com/cases/292?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=twitter_settlement_calculator)  


**Here is the story of why we developed it:**

About a month ago, I received this message in the comments:

https://preview.redd.it/9wdnjv5s2c1a1.png?width=1478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7056f9bf0ba7b2701641ae6a2c40b243daefc098

And we decided to double-check whether it was true or not. 

Official settlement website: [https://www.twittersecuritieslitigation.com/](https://www.twittersecuritieslitigation.com/)  
Official settlement notice (distribution formula could be found here): [https://www.twittersecuritieslitigation.com/Content/Documents/Notice.pdf](https://www.twittersecuritieslitigation.com/Content/Documents/Notice.pdf)  


Based on official documents we implemented the formula and created a simple calculator to estimate your payout:

https://preview.redd.it/7pc7k4ei5c1a1.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62e330ba7da41ab47961161d29ebcaa29d163cfc

But, your payout depends not only on your losses but also on the total amount of losses claimed by all eligible Investors. 

So, we did a quick search and found that Twitter lost about $10B during the class period. That would be the maximum amount that could be claimed in this class action.

On average about 30% of the total losses are claimed in securities class actions, we will use this for the benchmark.

In the end, we got that **on** **the** **$100,000 TWTR position, you will receive a $10,976 payout.** (which is about 25% of the recognized loss)

BANG! It was fun to learn that sometimes these settlements could bring significant profits, even though they occur many years after the actual loss.

The tycoon had last month tweeted to his followers ‚Äúto batten down the hatches‚Äù. When asked about the tweet, he told the American network in an interview that the advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike.

He said consumers should postpone buying big basket items that they have been eyeing for some time and big businesses should also go slow on acquisitions and capital expenditures because the US economy is likely to be in a recession ""very soon"".

‚ÄúTake some risk off the table,‚Äù Bezos told CNN. ‚ÄúKeep some dry powder on hand... Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You‚Äôve got to play the probabilities a little bit.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe economy does not look great right now,"" he said, adding, ""Things are slowing down, you're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors of the economy"". ""The probabilities say if we're not in a recession right now, we're likely to be in one very soon.""

The fourth richest person in the world said many people may be ‚Äúfeeling the pinch now‚Äù because of the extended economic downturn, but he appeared confident of a reverse in the trend in the coming time, saying as an optimist he believes the American Dream ‚Äúis and will be even more attainable in the future‚Äù.

Several other leading investors and analysts too have cautioned the American public about an impending recession. They have cited the Federal Reserve‚Äôs continuous efforts to curb inflation, which increased to a 40-year high of 9.1 per cent in June and remained at 7.7 percent until a month ago.

In the interview, Bezos also said that he will donate a majority of his $124 billion net worth to charities to fight climate change and growing social and political divisions.

* Bob Iger is back as CEO of Disney.
* Bob Chapek was named CEO in February 2020 and came under fire for various decisions.
* Shares of Dow 30 component Disney jumped in premarket trade Monday.

Disney, in a shocking late Sunday announcement, said it had reappointed Bob Iger as chief executive, effective immediately, after Iger‚Äôs hand-picked successor as CEO, Bob Chapek, came under fire for his management of the entertainment giant.

 ‚ÄúIt is with an incredible sense of gratitude and humility ‚Äî and, I must admit, a bit of amazement ‚Äî that I write to you this evening with the news that I am returning to The Walt Disney Company as Chief Executive Officer,‚Äù Iger wrote to employees in an email, which was obtained by CNBC.

Shares of Disney, a Dow component, were up about 8% in premarket trade Monday.

The dramatic upheaval comes 11 months after Iger left Disney, and days after Chapek said he planned to cut costs at the company, which had been burdened by swelling costs at its streaming service, Disney+. Earlier this month, the company‚Äôs earnings vastly underperformed Wall Street‚Äôs expectations. Even its theme park business, which reported a surge in revenue, delivered less than what analysts had projected.

Iger‚Äôs return also comes as legacy media companies contend with a rapidly shifting landscape, as ad dollars dry up and consumers increasingly cut off their cable subscriptions in favor of streaming.

Iger will help the company‚Äôs board develop a new successor, Disney said in a release.

3411,StockMarket,"**1.** **Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and executive chairman:**

""The economy does not look great right now. Things are slowing down, you're seeing layoffs in many, many sectors. The probabilities say if we're not in a recession right now, we're likely to be in one very soon. Take as much risk off the table as you can. Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.""

""The probabilities in this economy tell you to batten down the hatches.""

**2.** **Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter:**

""There's going to be probably a year or two of serious recession.""

""Frankly, the economic picture ahead is dire, especially for a company like ours that is so dependent on advertising in a challenging economic climate.""

**3.** **Ken Griffin, CEO of Citadel:**

""For the Fed to truly conquer inflation here, we're going to put unemployment somewhere in the mid-4% range. I find it hard to believe we're not going to have a recession at that point in time, sometime in the middle to back half of 2023.""

**4.** **Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's business partner and vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway:**

""I think the Fed is willing to have a little recession in order not to have out-of-control inflation. That's what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to be the one guy at the party that doesn't hang around the punch bowl getting drunk.""

**5.** **Carl Icahn, chairman of Icahn Enterprises:**

""Whenever you have higher interest rates that have moved as they have here, you have an inverted yield curve, Treasuries at close to a 5% yield ‚Äî you are going to have a recession. And I think we do have a recession already. There's a lot of things that have to happen to turn this economy around, to get us out of a recession.""

**6.** **Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan:**

""There's a possibility of a mild recession. Consumers are in very good shape, companies are in very good shape. And there's a possibility of something worse, mostly because of the war in Ukraine and oil price and all things like that.""

**7.** **David Solomon (DJ SOL), CEO of Goldman Sachs:**

""Generally, when you find yourself in an economic scenario like this, where inflation is embedded, it's very hard to get out of it without a real economic slowdown. The US is most likely going to have a recession.""

**8.** **Jeff Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital CEO:**

""Recession is easily 60% in the next six-to-eight months, and for the year 2023, I'd put it at more like 80%.""

**9.** **Leon Cooperman, CEO of Omega Advisors:**

""The combination of Fed tightening, quantitative tightening, a strong dollar, and the price of oil will create a recession in the second half of 2023. We've pulled forward demand because of very inappropriate fiscal and monetary policies, and ultimately a price is going to be paid.""

**10.** **Greg Jensen, co-CIO of Bridgewater Associates:**

""We are expecting a much bigger recession than the markets are expecting. 2023 will likely be the year of a very significant global recession.""

""You probably won't see the bottom of the equity markets until they begin easing, six to seven months from now. You probably won't see the end of the bottom of the economy for another nine months or so after that.""

**11.** **Nouriel Roubini, NYU Stern economist known as ""Dr. Doom"":**

""History suggests it's going to be near mission impossible to avoid a hard landing. You're going to get not only inflation, not only a recession, but what I call the 'Great Stagflationary Debt Crisis.' So it's much worse than the '70s, and it's probably as bad as during the Global Financial Crisis.""

**12.** **Ken Rogoff, Harvard economist:**

""You really have to look at the world, which is in bad shape. It's very hard for the United States to resist that. I worry that not only are we going to get a mild recession, I think the chances that we get a significant recession are really pretty high.""","Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Ken Griffin are sounding the alarm on a US recession.

3427,StockMarket,"The world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency fund has become embroiled in the turmoil swirling around the troubled sector, in a further sign of waning enthusiasm for digital assets.

**The share price of the $10.5bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which owns 3.5 per cent of the world‚Äôs bitcoin, has plummeted to a 39 per cent discount to the value of its underlying assets as investors have embarked on an increasingly desperate scramble to exit.**

**The blowout means investors in the trust have suffered an 83 per cent loss since bitcoin peaked in November 2021, outstripping the 74 per cent slide in the value of bitcoin itself.**

Confidence in digital assets has been sideswiped by the implosion of crypto exchange FTX, the fallout from which is rippling through the near-$1tn industry due to the complex and often opaque linkages between major players.

Fears struck closer to home for Grayscale on Wednesday when crypto broker Genesis Trading, which originated more than $50bn of loans last year, suspended redemptions and originations of loans at its lending arm after suffering financial contagion from the failure of Three Arrows Capital, the Singapore crypto hedge fund that filed for bankruptcy in July.

Grayscale and Genesis are both subsidiaries of Digital Currency Group, a Stamford, Connecticut-based venture capital company.

(I suppose I could also use an ITM call or would that be different??)

It seems to me that an Out of Money call on apple would NOT be substantially similar to owing the stock alone as it has its own risk related to time decay, and premium and is out of the money so will not move dollar for dollar with the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of me is also disappointed in the sketch design - in my opinion it takes away from the sweeping contours and beauty that only a real photo can show, just look at a photo of a porsche 959 and compare to the NFT sketch, i mean yeah, one is exciting, one is.. Dull

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, it is a nice touch that everything is hand drawn and gives an exclusive feel, for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, its really interesting to see how much the NFT space is growing, and i think the bear market has really hidden these things out of our view, and makes us think everything is dying.. sure prices are down but development is increasing, and adoption is crazy high.

&amp;#x200B;

So dont give up on your nfts guys, it is real value and will be a huge part of the world going forward.

* The announcement came less than a day after news outlets projected that Democrats would narrowly lose their House majority to Republicans following the midterm elections.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Thursday she will not seek reelection to her congressional leadership role, ending a two-decade streak as the top House Democrat that saw her become the first woman to lead the chamber.

Pelosi, speaking on the House floor, said she will remain a member of Congress and serve out the term to which she was just elected.

‚ÄúWith great confidence in our caucus, I will not seek reelection to Democratic leadership in the next Congress,‚Äù Pelosi said between rounds of applause throughout the 14-minute speech.

‚ÄúFor me, the hour has come for a new generation to lead the Democratic Congress that I so deeply respect,‚Äù Pelosi said. ‚ÄúAnd I am grateful that so many are ready and willing to shoulder this awesome responsibility.‚Äù

The announcement came a day after news outlets projected that Democrats would narrowly lose their House majority to Republicans following the midterm elections.

Pelosi, 82, has kept her future plans under wraps in the aftermath of the midterms, when Democrats exceeded expectations up and down the ballot. Republicans, who anticipated that a ‚Äúred wave‚Äù would deliver them sweeping majorities in Congress, will instead take a thin lead in the House, per NBC News estimates.

Pelosi has also said that a recent attack on her husband, Paul Pelosi, by a hammer-wielding home intruder would affect her decision on whether to remain in leadership.

Current House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is considered the top candidate to become speaker in the next Congress. On Tuesday, McCarthy won a party vote to become the GOP nominee for speaker, though he secured fewer votes than the 218 he will need when the full House casts its leadership votes in early January.

Much remains unclear about how the flip in House leadership will shake up Democrats‚Äô top ranks. House Majority Steny Hoyer, D-Md., has served under Pelosi for years ‚Äî but the 83-year-old announced later Thursday that he, too, would decline to seek a top role.

So the New York Fed keeps tabs on something called SOMA (System Open Market Account).

Now you may have heard of Quantitative easing. This is when the Fed is buying up securities on the open market which drive bond prices up and yields down. This is their way of messing with the rates and increasing the supply of money in the economy

Now Quantitative Tightening is basically the undoing of all this.

So how do we know what the fed is holding onto? Well that's where this SOMA comes into play.

Here is a link where you can see this. They update these numbers every week

[SOMA](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/soma-holdings)

So the Bottom line says ""Changes from Prior Week""

If this bottom line is negative, it means they are getting rid of assets. If it's positive, it means they are adding assets. In theory, these actions should mess with yields.

So why is this important? Well this could affect equity markets. Here are some instances of correlation I've found

[January 19th](https://i.postimg.cc/9fFvTnd8/image.png)

So on this week, the fed added 90b to their balance sheet in assets. This was one of the last major major purchases.

[February 16th](https://i.postimg.cc/bYTkVVkH/image.png)

On this week, the fed added about 50b to their balance sheet in assets. Haven't seen one as big as this since. We were also expecting the fed funds rate to go up in the March and there was a lot of fear around this time.

[March 16th](https://i.postimg.cc/gjT9kqXS/image.png)

So on this week, the fed added to their balance sheet 42b in assets and we see markets go absolutely nuts after a long period of selling off. Ultimately we now know this was a bull trap

This isn't a whole lot of selling, but look at this consecutive selling on both these weeks. It's about 35b together

[October 5th](https://i.postimg.cc/prTfJKGt/image.png)

Come October, we see this massive 38b change of asset outflow. You look at Nasdaq end of September and early October and boy the selloff was nasty. So now you have to look at this and wonder.... is there a strong enough correlation here?

NASDAQ:RGC

Traditional ‚Äúwestern‚Äù medicine has made amazing advances and is one of the great innovations in history, but, unfortunately, there are still many conditions afflicting people that western medicine hasn‚Äôt been able to treat with any great effectiveness. It‚Äôs in instances like these that it can be beneficial to look to a medical approach that‚Äôs been around for over 2,000 years‚Äîa practice known as Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). It‚Äôs this approach that Regencell (NASDAQ:RGC) is embracing to improve the lives of the millions dealing with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disease (ASD) and an approach that has shown some encouraging improvements that sufferers of these conditions and their families are likely to be interested in.

  

Regencell Bioscience (RGC) is an early-stage bioscience company that focuses on the research, development and commercialization of TCM for the treatment of neurocognitive disorders and degenerations, specifically ADHD and ASD. Before getting into the specific applications for ADHD and ASD, the TCM approach to addressing health issues may be somewhat unknown to those of us in the west and it would be helpful to understand the big picture before drilling down to the specifics. According to the National Institute of Health, TCM uses various psychological and/or physical approaches as well as herbal products to address health problems, examples of these approaches include:

‚Ä¢ Tai Chi

‚Ä¢ Acupuncture

‚Ä¢ Herbal Products

Johns Hopkins Medicine notes that the basic concept behind TCM is that a vital life force, called Qi, surges through the body. Any imbalance to Qi can cause disease and illness. This imbalance is most commonly thought to be caused by an alteration in the opposite and complementary forces that make up the Qi. These are called yin and yang. Getting a little more specific in TCM, the functions of the brain are dispersed to five zang organs, and are maintained by comprehensive functional interactions among the five zang organs. Therefore, brain diseases such as ASD and ADHD are regarded as systematic diseases in TCM, and their treatments are aimed to normalize not only the activity of the organs, but also the balance of functional interaction.i

Regencell takes this theory behind TCM a little further and the company notes that their TCM formulas are derived from a TCM base formula plus an adjustable formula developed by Regencell‚Äôs strategic partner, TCM practitioner, Mr. Sik-Kee Au, based on his TCM brain theory. The TCM brain theory explains why a healthy brain is essential in restoring the body‚Äôs systems to normal. According to the TCM brain theory, the blockage of or reduced blood flow, and damage of the interconnecting central nervous system, endocrine system and blood circulatory system disrupt the production of hormones and transmission of neurotransmitters, such as melatonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, leading to a defective encoding and decoding of functions, and resulting in deficient or abnormal social behaviors that are the hallmarks of ADHD and ASD.

Before we get into the recently released trial results, why is Regencell spending so much time and energy on addressing these two conditions? According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) approximately 1 in 44 children is diagnosed with being on the ASD spectrum and at the present time there is no available ‚Äúcure.‚Äù Current autism treatments involve developmental, educational and behavioral approaches, which have varying degrees of improving the lives of those with ASD. With ADHD, again according to the CDC, there are over six million children aged 3-17 diagnosed with having the condition. In contrast to ASD, however, there are some treatments for ADHD in the form of medications such as:

‚Ä¢ Dexedrine

‚Ä¢ Zenzedi

‚Ä¢ Adderall

‚Ä¢ Focalin

‚Ä¢ Ritalin

We aren‚Äôt here to disparage those medications as they have undoubtedly allowed some children with ADHD to better control their actions, but as with many medications there are some unfortunate side effects that can impact users of the above medicines including: loss of appetite, weight loss, sleep problems, crankiness and tics. While not all families dealing with these conditions would necessarily be interested in alternative treatments, there are millions that would look into a treatment option that offered improvement in the conditions, while causing no side effects to those undergoing the treatments. And the market for current methods of addressing these conditions is large and expected to grow over the coming years:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8w58z4m8ij0a1.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81e909fedd1305a8fa15f332fbc05e44627daab0

 

And the market that Regencell is attempting to address is even larger as they are likely to enter the Chinese and Hong Kong markets as well. One interesting difference to pay attention to as Regencell moves forward is that a treatment such as this can enter the US market as a nutritional product and therefore requires no governmental approval, reducing the barriers to entry in the US. In China and Hong Kong, however, a Proprietary Chinese Medicine (PCM) designation is needed for the product to be sold, a situation the company is well versed in and will pursue as the treatment gets closer to being ready for commercialization.

The company just completed the second efficacy trial, which was designed to evaluate and assess the effectiveness of Regencell‚Äôs standardized TCM formula in reducing ADHD and ASD symptoms during the course of a 3-month treatment. The trial is a non-blinded efficacy trial and patients in the trial were between 6 and 12 at the time of the treatment and clinically diagnosed with ADHD and/or ASD. The program required all patients to stop their existing medications, attend weekly treatment sessions with their parents, and follow the TCM Practitioner‚Äôs dietary guidelines during the 3-month treatment. Regencell selected 7 children (6 males and 1 female) to participate in the trial. 3 of the patients were diagnosed with ADHD and 4 of them with ASD.

The first results from this trial were just released and showed encouraging improvements. When dealing with these conditions, the company used three different methods to measure improvement:

‚Ä¢ SKATBT-A3‚Äî48-item questionnaire designed and developed by Regencell to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment in improving ADHD and ASD patients‚Äô symptoms. SKATBT-A3 assesses a patient‚Äôs overall physical and neurodevelopmental conditions. SKATBT-A3 includes elements that are conditions of patients usually observed during TCM treatments such as: (i) speech/language/communication; (ii) patients‚Äô sociability; (iii) sensory/cognitive awareness; and (iv) physical health and behavior.

‚Ä¢ VADRS‚Äîa tool commonly used to measure ADHD severity.

‚Ä¢ ATEC‚ÄîThe ATEC was designed as a comparative subscale for ASD diagnosed individuals ‚Äì that is to measure change in ASD individuals due to various interventions by difference between the initial (baseline) ATEC scores and later ATEC scores.

All patients orally consumed the standardized TCM formula twice daily for 3 months. Improvements in patients‚Äô symptoms were assessed weekly during treatment review sessions with the TCM Practitioner and the children‚Äôs parents.

And here‚Äôs the exciting part, after three months, the SKATBT-A3¬†scores of all patients were lower, indicating fewer problems and improvements in symptoms. According to the company, there were noticeable improvements in the patients‚Äô overall health, ADHD symptoms and ASD symptoms. Common improvements noted included better sleep quality, reduced temper, better bowel movement and healthier complexion. The most notable improvement was demonstrated by two patients who gained the ability to control their tongues naturally without the aid of their own hands after the 3-month treatment. According to company management, this development is noteworthy because limited tongue function affects verbal communications and language abilities.

Improvement was also seen in the measures not designed by Regencell, with the VADRS scores of five patients coming in lower, indicating fewer problems and improvements in symptoms, while one patient‚Äôs score remained the same and one patient‚Äôs score was higher. Percentage improvements of patients ranged between -21% and 62%, with a mean of 21%. Additionally, the ATEC scores of all patients were lower, indicating fewer problems and improvements in symptoms. Percentage improvement of all patients ranged between 4% and 52%, with a mean of 22%. The company provided some color on the ATEC results and noted that they saw the most significant drop in scores in the health/physical/behavior subscale. Constipation, sleeping problems, poor appetite, anxiety/fearfulness, and irritability are common issues among ADHD and ASD patients and according to Regencell most of the patients suffered from these symptoms before the treatment but these symptoms improved after the treatment.

Importantly, none of the patients experienced any adverse side effects after the 3-month treatment. Additionally, while no guarantees can be made, herbal TCM treatments have an accumulating effect, meaning that while the greatest gains may be seen during the initial months of treatment, progress can be expected to continue the longer treatment is maintained.

While these are trials and there are no conclusions yet, the results seen so far warrant attention and we recommend investors to continue to monitor Regencell‚Äôs updates and developments. We are excited for the potential impact and market opportunity of the treatment.",RGC: Forging a New Approach to ADHD and ASD,1668703970

3608,StockMarket,"Largo (TSX:LGO) (NASDAQ:LGO) announced earnings today that largely met expectations and management reiterated they are on track to meet the lower range of 2022 guidance even with multiple one-time production hurdles over the last six months.

For a two minute video summary of the quarter, take a look here: [https://youtu.be/5NqFIQ01XvI](https://youtu.be/5NqFIQ01XvI)

With a new mining contractor in place and major maintenance completed, production costs should moderate going forward while production continues to grow, leading to a strong potential step change in profitability.

Inflationary pressures continue to impact Largo, but this is true for most peers across the board and if inflation persists, it has historically been a bullish signal for commodity producers like Largo.

Largo is currently going through one of those plateau periods that in the moment seems difficult, but in hindsight turns out to be a truly golden opportunity for investors.  Largo is dealing with weakening demand from the steel industry and moderating vanadium prices in the short term, but in only 3 quarters the catalysts will be coming fast and heavy

* Commissioning of the ilmenite Ti02 plant in Q2 2023 which at full capacity is estimated to add $30 million or 15% growth to revenue according to the company‚Äôs latest technical report.
* Increase in high purity vanadium demand and production, which commands a price premium for Largo‚Äôs high quality V2O5 and V2O3 products.
* Commissioning of Largo‚Äôs first Vanadium Redox Flow Battery project in Q2 2023. This project with Enel will be critical to proving out the economics and operational superiority of Largo‚Äôs unique battery storage tech.

[Largo: Key Catalysts](https://preview.redd.it/0z7zl8e2dj0a1.png?width=653&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f66c3446d9f39dbd0a2e833a0ff650f315f50b75)

Structural demand for battery metals, of which Vanadium is one, is growing exponentially this decade and should lead to higher prices and an entirely new level of demand for the few high purity vanadium producers like Largo. Coupled with Largo‚Äôs potential as a battery supplier through Largo Clean Energy and Largo Physical Vanadium (Ticker: VAND) revolutionizing the commercial renting of long-term battery solutions, Largo is poised to thrive through the rest of this decade, economic slowdown or not.

Largo is well positioned to execute on all its priorities with $83 million of cash, which includes the new $20 million debt issued in October against annual investment spending of $25 million net of cashflow from operations.

 The ongoing buyback of shares is also a strong indicator of management‚Äôs faith that the true value of Largo shares is higher than where the stock trades today. 

The company bought back an estimated 2.3% of the public float in the quarter, spending $5.8 million. 2.8 million shares remain in the buyback, 8% of the public float and are expected to be purchased over the next 7 months. 

**Q3 2022 Highlights**

* Revenues of $54.3 million vs. revenues of $53.9 million in Q3 2021; Revenues per lb sold of $8.80 vs. $9.10 in Q3 2021
* Net loss of $2.6 million vs. net income of $9.2 million in Q3 2021; Basic loss per share of $0.04 in Q3 2022; Inclusive of approximately $3.0 million in non-recurring expenditures such as legal and listing costs for Largo Physical Vanadium Corp. (‚ÄúLPV‚Äù) and an increase in legal provisions
* Net cash provided by operating activities of $10.0 million vs. $15.5 million in Q3 2021
* Operating costs of $45.6 million vs. $32.1 million in Q3 2021 and cash operating costs excluding royalties per pound of V2O5 equivalent sold of $4.86 in Q3 2022 vs. $3.53 in Q3 2021
* Largo exited the quarter with $63 million of cash.

**Increased Production of High Purity Material**

V2O5 equivalent production from the Marac√°s Menchen Mine was a total of 2,906 tonnes produced in Q3 2022, down only 11% year over year even with significant refurbishment downtime and the transition to an entirely new mining contractor. Sales increased 4% year over year which continues the company‚Äôs positive sales growth momentum from the low point in Q1 2022.

Production in July was impacted by a refractory refurbishment in the kiln and cooler with production in September being largely impacted by a lower amount of mined material due to the transition of mining contractors, which was completed in September.

The move to a new mining contractor was enacted due to underperformance by the last contractor and should lead to stronger output going forward.

In Q3 2022, 351,450 tonnes of ore were mined with a grade of 1.02% of V2O5. ¬†The lower ore mined and effective grade during the quarter was due to the mining contractor transition and will rebound.¬† Largo produced 99,513 tonnes of concentrate with a V2O5 grade of 3.26%.

Largo is well positioned to capitalize on increasing demand for high purity vanadium in the aerospace and chemical industries.

 **Operational Highlights**

Largo had operating costs of $45.6 million Q3 2022 (Q3 2021 ‚Äì $32.1 million), which  
include direct mine and production costs of $24.7 million (Q3 2021 ‚Äì $18.6t million).  
Production costs were impacted by the kiln refurbishment and contractor transition  
but will likely moderate in coming quarters with these one off items behind the  
company.

The increase in direct mine and productions costs can is primarily due to cost increases in critical consumables, including heavy fuel oil and ammonium sulfate.

There was also increased consumption of these critical consumables and sodium carbonate.

Higher production costs were also driven by shutdowns for the refractory refurbishment in the kiln and cooler, repairs to the cooler support bearing, maintenance of the cooler and power substation.¬† Operating costs continue to be impacted by reduced de-ammoniator and kiln availability and the time between production and sales.

The company also recognized an inventory write-down for its purchased products this quarter, which was mainly due to the decrease in average benchmark prices.

Cash operating costs excluding royalties were $4.86 per lb sold in Q3 2022, compared with $3.53 for Q3 2021.

The increase seen in Q3 2022 compared with Q3 2021 is largely due to the reasons noted above for operating costs and remains in line with prior 2022 guidance. Further, produced V2O5 equivalent sold decreased as compared with Q3 2021.

The Company recorded a net loss of $2.6 million in Q3 2022, compared with a net income of $9.1 million in Q3 2021. This movement was primarily due to lower sales and an increase in operating costs, professional, consulting and management fees and other general and administrative expenses.

**Production**

V2O5 equivalent production was a total of 2,906 tonnes produced in Q3 2022. Production in July was impacted by the refractory refurbishment in the kiln and cooler, with September impacted by lower quantities of ore mined as the Largo moved to a new mining contractor.

August‚Äôs production rate hit 1,140 tons meaning the company could easily hit production of 3,400 tons for the quarter if no operational one-off issues get in the way.

The global recovery achieved in Q3 2022 was 80.7%, a 3.6% decrease from the 83.7% achieved in Q3 2021. The global recovery in July 2022 was 80.1%, with 81.3% achieved in August and 80.8% achieved in September.

**Sales**

In Q3 2022, Largo sold 2,796 tonnes of V2O5¬†equivalent (Q3 2021 ‚Äì 2,685 tonnes) up 4% over the same time last year, including 351 tonnes of purchased products (Q3 2021 ‚Äì 135 tonnes).

Produced V2O5¬†equivalent sold decreased, with 5.4 million lbs sold in Q3 2022, as compared with 5.6 million lbs sold in Q3 2021.

Lower Q3 2022 sales are attributable to weaker spot demand during the period as well as ongoing shipment delays.

**Largo Clean Energy (LCE)**

During Q3 2022, LCE made good progress on the Enel Green Power Espa√±a (‚ÄúEGPE‚Äù) contract, which remains a key focus. All high-power battery stacks have been manufactured and the company is working on factory acceptance testing. The required battery stack containers are fully assembled, and final validation and factory acceptance testing remains ongoing.

Additionally, electrolyte storage containers are progressing through the final painting, lining and integration process. Most of the required alternating current (‚ÄúAC‚Äù) components have been manufactured and factory-accepted, and shipment to the deployment site has begun. The battery deployment site is under construction and LCE expects to begin equipment installation in November 2022.

LCE continues to experience shipping and logistical delays related to certain components for its EGPE VRFB deployment, but still expects commissioning to begin next year.

Management is monitoring the situation closely and now expects the completion of the commissioning of the EGPE VRFB to begin in Q2 2023.

As their clean energy division grows, Largo has been actively exploring opportunities to benefit from the recently passed inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. which includes approximately $60 billion of clean energy manufacturing tax credits and $30 billion of tax credits for state and electric utilities to adopt clean energy and clean energy storage.

Largo believes that their U.S.-based clean energy business should qualify for some of the credits, and will provide updates on their efforts in this direction.

**Largo Physical Vanadium (LPV)**

In Q3 2022, Largo‚Äôs industry first public vanadium vehicle began trading on the TSX exchange under the ticker VAND. Largo initially contributed 200 tonnes of V2O5¬†equivalent and $20.0 million of the $30.2 million that LPV raised in a financing that closed in April 2022. Largo physical vanadium currently holds 523 tonnes and has a net asset value of $34 million.

LPV was created to acquire and store vanadium units in commercial forms as well as in electrolyte solutions for VRFB applications. LPV ensures adequate supplies of Vanadium for battery customers while also dampening price volatility of vanadium in the market.",Analysis of Largo's Q3 Earnings - Focused on the Structural Growth Ahead,1668702117

I know it started after the FTX blowup but as per a recent article: their CEO Alan Lane said last Friday that their total deposits from all digital asset customers totaled $11.9 billion as of Sept. 30, of which FTX represented less than 10%. The company said it had ""no outstanding loans to nor investments in FTX,"" and said FTX was not a custodian for bitcoin-collateralized loans. Do people think Lane is lying about this and has a much bigger exposure to FTX/Alameda.

Operating leverage or Operating Leverage means that the sales growth rate is higher than the cost growth rate, which means that the cost increase required for a company like Google to increase its revenue is relatively limited. Help profit margins continue to increase. In the third quarter of 2022, TCI said the company's costs increased by 18%, but revenue was only 6%. As a result, Google's EBIT margin fell, from 39% to 32%.

&amp;#x200B;

TCI mentioned the recent wave of layoffs, saying that Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce and many other technology companies are laying off employees, suggesting that you should follow suit. The company's headcount has risen by an average of 20% per year over the past five years, compared with just 14% prior to 2017. They believe that such a growth rate of 20% is really unnecessary. It seems that TCI really can't sit still and must write a letter to push Google.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to too many people, Google's salary is too high. The median salary in 2021 is $296,000, according to the company's own disclosures. And according to an analysis by S&amp;P Global, Google pays 67 percent more than fellow giant Microsoft and 153 percent more than the top 20 U.S. tech companies. This makes absolutely no sense.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TCI also pointed out that we admit that Google's salary is so high to attract the best engineers and programmers, but these are only a small part of the company's personnel. Compensation for many sales, marketing, and administrative roles should be in line with other tech companies. As long as the adjustment of personnel is completed, the company's EBIT margin can easily exceed 40%.

&amp;#x200B;

As for Google's other investments, TCI noted that it has only reaped $3 billion in revenue over the past five years, while taking on $20 billion in losses. None of these bets have been successful for Google, and it should cut its investment by at least 50% on this front. The biggest of these is self-driving Waymo. Enthusiasm for self-driving has died out during this time, Ford and Volkswagen have both shut down their self-driving businesses, and Google should cut Waymo's losses. The implication is, don't hold on, this dream is too expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, TCI strongly encourages companies to buy back stock, pointing out that Google is now trading at just 16 times forward earnings, which is very cheap. Moreover, although the company spends about 60 billion to repurchase shares every year, it still has 116 billion in cash on its books, lying there, which is of no help to shareholders and the company.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that the salary given by Google is very high, but I didn't expect it to be so high. It seems that I chose the wrong major that year. But having said that, TCI's concerns are worthy of attention. Google has always been growing rapidly, which makes it rich and self-willed, but it also causes the company to have no culture or discipline to control costs for many years, and in the future In an environment of low growth and tight liquidity, cost control will become particularly important. If this economic downturn allows Google to further improve its cost management capabilities, then I believe that after this cycle, its future will be brighter.","Shareholder pressure, Google may lay off significantly?",1668698154
3618,StockMarket,"The wealthy haven't bought stocks in over 50 years. All they do is sell...you know that, right?

In the old days, back in the 60's, 70's and part of the 80's, there was a thing called ""buy low, sell high"". The trading strategy was valid back then because shorts actually covered their short positions when they were wrong. They had to pay higher and many ended up going broke. 

That all changed!

Now short sellers have no risk. They get bailed out by the US Government. They get insiders to be in bed with them to screw over shareholders. If stocks go up in value, the shorts never cover. They just wait...and the big banks forgive them their interest payments. On the contrary, they give them more money to short. Naked shorting...you've heard of that? This is happening as we speak. These people play with money they don't have.

Insiders have only one goal: to sell shares. They announce good...bad...whatever. They sell only. And when they run out of shares to sell, they print more! And when the price gets to low and the exchange threatens to delist them, they authorize new shares and reverse split. You think your vote counts? Never. 

It doesn't matter if the stock is $100/share or $10/share or $1/share. When insiders sell something that they paid nothing to buy, it's 100% profits for them. For you, it's a loss because you actually paid a price to buy shares.

3650,StockMarket,"On Wednesday, Williams, permanent member of the Federal Open Market Committee and New York Fed President, said the Fed should continue to focus on its economic goals when making a decision to raise interest rates and avoid taking financial stability risks into consideration.

In a speech on the U.S. Treasury market, Williams argued that using monetary policy to mitigate financial stability vulnerabilities could have adverse consequences for the economy. He said monetary policy should not act as a panacea, as if everything can be solved by it.

Williams, one of the central bank's top leaders, made the comments amid heightened volatility in global financial markets in recent days, underscoring the central bank's determination to keep monetary policy tight enough to slow economic growth and curb inflation for 40 years. The determination to come down from a high. However, he did not comment on the near-term outlook for monetary policy.

As president of the New York Fed, Williams played a key role in overseeing the Fed and the financial system. He said that price stability is crucial to the normal operation of the US economy, and central banks around the world should take strong actions to restore price stability.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made reforms over the past few years to support the functioning of the market under stress,‚Äù Williams said, referring to the Fed‚Äôs standing repurchase agreement facility launched last year, which is ‚Äúready to appear in the market at any time.‚Äù .‚Äù Provide essential liquidity during times of financial stress. ""

Williams pointed to the need to find solutions to strengthen the financial system without compromising the goals of monetary policy, and there is now a need to strengthen the resilience of financial markets.

Just the day before, the New York Fed issued a document stating that although the liquidity of U.S. Treasury bonds has deteriorated this year and volatility has risen sharply in line with market expectations, there are reasons to worry about its underlying resilience of the market. Regulators and industry players should closely monitor this development and continue to take steps to strengthen this critical market.

The lower-than-normal level of liquidity means that a liquidity shock will have a bigger impact on prices than usual and be more likely to trigger a sell-off in securities, between high volatility and illiquidity, according to two NYSE researchers.

Do you guys think that this has just begun and we are headed for a serious economic downturn and stocks are just going to continue plummeting?

I think this topic deserves a discussion, we need to try and use our collective intelligence to formulated a good playbook to execute over the next year or so if things are going to get ugly.

I'm going to link the article here so you can read the more in depth version of what I'm talking about, when you see the number it really doesn't look good....

3671,StockMarket,"**WESTLAKE VILLAGE, CA / ACCESSWIRE / November 1, 2022 /** Star Alliance International Corp. (OTC PINK:STAL; ""Star"" ***is excited to announce that our Genesis Gold extraction System which extracts up to 98% of the gold from oxide ore and is environmentally safe, is fully tested, and working very efficiently. Our new updated model will process up to 5000 tons of ore daily not just from Oxide ore but also from other more complex ore.***

STAL announced in December 2021 that it had signed a Binding letter of Intent to acquire a 51% stake in the two Genesis gold extraction processes and we are now finalizing the transaction after our team has fully vetted the equipment and its spectacular results. Our original Genesis equipment processes up to 350 tons of Oxide ore daily, generating substantial gold deposits at a level significantly greater than other heap leaching methods, up to a 98% recovery rate, is a much faster process and is environmentally safe.

Our new Genesis Gold Extraction System processes gold bearing minerals from the most complex to the simplest ores at up to 5000 tons per day. Our new process has been in development since 2016. Now our process is complete, being patented and our new plant is being built which will be ready in 2023. Within our specially designed reactors, both leaching and pre-treatment occur thereby reducing costs. This versatility also allows for the treatment of the ore regulating the PH or other chemicals necessary to accelerate the regeneration of the discarded soil.

Currently complex coal-sulfide minerals, known as double refractoriness minerals, require roasters to burn the coal and after this treat the sulfides making it potentially dangerous for the environment and economically not viable. Mines with complex low grade minerals are currently unprofitable with conventional methods. In our process, we attack both refractoriness minerals in the same reactor system without the use of fossil fuels. We achieve this through low power electricity converting the most complex gold-carbon-sulfide ore into a free gold oxide that can then be leached in any traditional way.

***Genesis will convert any ore with one or two refractoriness to oxidized ore making them economically viable and environmentally friendly. We can also treat already oxidized minerals without the need for pretreatment. This phase, where we treat oxides, can be used to replace processes such as heap leaching or gravimetric processes, since it is not necessary to pulverize the ore to be leached. Other advantages are the speed of our process, greater control, automation, ore reconditioning. and full recovery of precious metals.***

*Richard Carey, our Chairman stated: ""*We have been working with the inventor who has spent the last year perfecting the design on the larger refractory ore processing system, "" we are now excited to confirm that the equipment will not only manage the process of 5,000 tons of ore per day but will became the primary process that will be used worldwide to extract gold and silver from complex deposits Our system will be both more eco-friendly and with greater productivity. ***We will soon be ready to introduce our system to mines all over the world.""***

***Weverson Correia, CEO of Star commented*** ""**This new system is a ""game changer""**. There is nothing like it worldwide. It is the future of low-grade gold deposits that are currently unprofitable while protecting the environment at the same time. ***This system will revolutionize the mining industry***.""

3687,StockMarket,"Recently, whether the United States will fall into a recession has become a topic of discussion among more and more Wall Street investment banks.

&amp;#x200B;

On the one hand, the U.S. 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds have been inverted since July this year, and the yield curve of the U.S. 3-month and 10-year Treasury bonds showed the largest inversion since the end of 2019 yesterday, indicating that the market Fears of a recession are growing.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, Wall Street and Silicon Valley in the United States have started a wave of large-scale layoffs, and business tycoons such as Musk and Bezos have frequently warned that a recession is imminent.

&amp;#x200B;

So, if the US recession does come, how should we allocate assets? Perhaps we can look for more valuable answers by referring to the performance of assets during recessions in previous history.

&amp;#x200B;

Since 1854, the U.S. has experienced 32 cycles of expansion and contraction, with an average recession of 17 months, according to economists, while several recessions since 1980 have averaged less than 10 months.

&amp;#x200B;

From 1980 to the present, the United States has mainly experienced the following five economic recession periods: July 1981-November 1982, July 1990-March 1991, March 2001-November 2001, December 2007 ‚Äì June 2009 and February-April 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

Among them, the last two recessions are deep recessions (GDP falls by more than 3%), and the first three are mild recessions (GDP falls within 3%).

&amp;#x200B;

Looking back at the performance of U.S. stocks and other major assets during these five recessions, it can be seen that:

&amp;#x200B;

Gold typically performs well as a safe-haven asset during recessions, gaining an average of 6%, while crude oil can fall due to a demand slump, especially during a deep recession - especially in early 2020, due to The new crown epidemic led to a sudden drop in global crude oil demand, and international oil prices even fell to a negative value for a time.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, it is worth noting that a bear market in U.S. stocks does not necessarily occur during an economic recession: for example, in the three mild recessions from 1981 to 2001, the decline in U.S. stocks did not reach the 20% bear market standard line. In fact, of the 25 bear markets that U.S. stocks have experienced since 1928, only 14 have been associated with recessions.

&amp;#x200B;

2001 Recession: Tech stocks were the biggest losers. Recession of 2008: All sectors of the US stock market are muddy. As can be seen from the two recessions mentioned above, sectors such as pharmaceuticals, consumer goods and utilities tend to be relatively ‚Äúresilient‚Äù during mild recessions, while tech and cyclical sectors tend to be more vulnerable; in deep recessions During this period, almost all stock assets will be sold off, and even relatively ""resilient"" sectors will not escape the doom of being sold off.",Which stocks could be a safe haven if the U.S. falls into a recession?,1668608154

# [Stock futures slip as investors await October retail sales data](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures dipped Wednesday as investors weighed another lighter-than-expected inflation report and looked ahead to retail sales data.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded marginally lower. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also fell slightly.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after Target reported much weaker-than-expected earnings for the third quarter. The results weighed on futures and sent the stock down more than 13%. Target also warned of a weak holiday quarter.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a positive session, with the S&amp;P 500 closing up 0.87% on Tuesday and the Dow adding 56.22 points, or 0.17%. The Nasdaq jumped 1.45% and is the only major average on pace to eke out slight gains for the week. The producer price index report, which measures wholesale prices, came in below expectations, which alleviated some of investors‚Äô concerns around inflation.
*****
&gt; Chinese technology stocks were among the best performers Tuesday, with the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF gaining 9.56% for its best daily performance since March 16. Nine out of 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors rose, led to the upside by communication services and information technology. Both health care and materials posted slight losses.
*****
&gt; Stocks have staged a solid run following last week‚Äôs better-than-feared consumer price index report. The S&amp;P 500 last week posted its best weekly stretch since June and all the major averages are on track to finish the month with gains.
*****
&gt; Some investors say a near-term retreat is on the horizon, however.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIn the short term, the market is very extended and overdue to pull back and digest the recent rally,‚Äù said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments.
*****
&gt; Retail sales due out Wednesday could offer another look at consumer behavior amid inflation.

3691,StockMarket,"Outspoken economist Nouriel Roubini¬†described crypto and some of its major players as an ‚Äúecosystem that is totally corrupt.‚Äù

On a panel hosted by CNBC‚Äôs Dan Murphy at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week on Wednesday, the New York University professor said there were ‚Äúseven Cs of crypto‚Äù: ‚ÄúConcealed, corrupt, crooks, criminals, con men, carnival barkers,‚Äù and finally, Binance Chief Executive Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, who spoke on a prior panel at the same conference.

‚ÄúThe lesson of the last few weeks is these people should be out of here,‚Äù Roubini added. CNBC has contacted Binance and Changpeng Zhao for comment.

Recent turbulence in the crypto market has seen the collapse of one of the world‚Äôs biggest crypto exchanges, FTX, with the revelation of highly risky and unsustainable borrowing and lending by the company and related investment funds.

The price of bitcoin has plunged below $17,000 for the first time since 2020, and some fear the contagion could spread to topple other major players, such as Crypto.com. The CEO of the company has denied this.

Binance has repeatedly centered the story around FTX, with the company initially suggesting it would buy its failing rival before pulling out of the deal.

3694,StockMarket,"* Target is projecting a drop in comparable sales this quarter for the first time in 5 years
* Shoppers have been hit hard by inflation, interest rates, and economic uncertainty, resulting in disappointing Q3 earnings results
* Profits have also been hurt by discounts to clear out excess inventory, the cost of managing said inventory, and shoplifting. Food and beverage sales have done well, but the home goods, sporting goods, and toys category has struggled. 
* Walmart reported more upbeat earnings as a result of higher income Americans turning toward the retailer in search of lower prices
* Target CFO Michael Fiddelke said he expects the difficulties to continue into 2023, with efforts being made to cut costs (but without mass layoffs) of upwards to $2 to $3 billion over the next 3 years

Are Target's Q3 earnings the canary in the coal mine for retail spending? Maybe we'll have to wait until we see the impacts of the current macro environment on holiday shopping to have a better forecast for retail conditions next year. But still, looking for cost cuts over the next few years is a pretty pessimistic sign.

3725,StockMarket,"Several Fed district chairs spoke on the outlook for interest rates and inflation, with policymakers maintaining a cautiously hawkish tone.

Citing signs, including slowing commodity price growth, Bostic said in an essay that there have been some recent positive signs that inflation may be slowing. Bostic stressed that he would like to see the pace of price increases for services and goods slow, but so far this has not happened.

He noted that the Fed's policy committee added commentary to its recent statement that the impact of monetary policy has a lag. The lag between policy action and its impact on prices is uncertain, with some estimates suggesting it could take ""18 months to two years"" for inflation to fall, he said.

The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points for the fourth straight time on Nov. 2, raising the target range to 3.75%-4% from near zero in March, though Bostic did not comment on the December policy meeting. There were no specific comments, but the consensus was for a 50 basis point hike next month.

The key, Bostic said, may be a more balanced labor market because services are labor-intensive. But the labor market remains tight, with job openings still far outnumbering job applicants, putting upward pressure on wages.

Richmond Fed President Barkin said he is closely monitoring liquidity and interest rate risks. He warned that inflation was too high and the economy would slow sharply, but the U.S. was not in recession. Barkin said he did not have an accurate forecast for the unemployment rate, emphasizing the Fed's commitment to price stability. He said he would see unemployment rise but wasn't sure how high it would go. He said the Fed relies on data to act, and employment is one of the indicators the Fed watches.

Philadelphia Fed President Harker said the Fed is expected to slow down the pace of rate hikes as monetary policy approaches a level of strictness enough to keep rates unchanged at a constrained level sometime next year for monetary policy to work.

""Given the austerity measures we've already put in place, I expect the pace of rate hikes to slow in the coming months as policy rates approach fully restrictive levels,"" Harker said.

Harker reiterated his previous view that as long as the Fed continues to meaningfully suppress inflation, it can pause rate hikes if necessary. From a policy point of view, instead of risking excessive tightening, it is better to temporarily suspend interest rate hikes.

Data last week showed that U.S. consumer prices fell more than expected in October. The consumer price index rose by 7.7% year-on-year and rose by 8.2% last month.","The local chairman of the Federal Reserve maintains a cautious and hawkish tone, and there are positive signs that inflation may be slowing down",1668565853

New owner Elon Musk has reportedly fired several employees for criticizing his leadership publicly on Twitter and privately in internal Slack channels.

At least two longtime engineers at the social media platform were let go over the weekend after they pushed back on some of the comments the billionaire posted on the site, Bloomberg News reported. And, confirming reports out of Protocal and Platformer that additional employees were fired for private Slack messages, Musk offered a brief apology on Tuesday: ‚ÄúI would like to apologize for firing these geniuses. Their immense talent will no doubt be of great use elsewhere.‚Äù

Per Platformer, it seems about 20 employees so far were fired Tuesday for private Slack messages criticizing their new leadership, as emails stating, ‚ÄúWe regret to inform you that your employment is terminated immediately ‚Ä¶ Your recent behavior has violated company policy,‚Äù were sent out.

The news comes after a Sunday break where Musk, who touts himself as committed to ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù, canned Eric Frohnhoefer, who said he spent six years working on Twitter for Android.

Sunday night, Frohnhoefer reposted a tweet from Musk ‚Äúfor Twitter being super slow in many countries,‚Äù and said it was wrong. Musk replied and asked Frohnhoefer to elaborate, before writing, ‚ÄúTwitter is super slow on Android. What have you done to fix that?‚Äù

The engineer ended up in an exchange with Musk explaining some technical aspect of the app on Android and offering his view on why it might run slowly.

In a since-deleted tweet, Musk posted, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs fired.‚Äù Frohnhoefer retweeted the post with a saluting emoji.

Markets continue to assess signs of cooling U.S. inflation and the possibility of a shift in the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy stance.

Tesla, the trading volume champion, closed down 2.56% with a turnover of 17.66 billion US dollars. Tesla believes making 'more affordable cars will make a lot of sense,' says Tesla CEO Elon Musk

The second-ranked Apple closed down 0.95%, with a turnover of 10.903 billion US dollars. JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee maintained an ""overweight"" rating on Apple with a price target of $200. Chatterjee lowered Apple's iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter from 82 million to 74 million, and expects both iPhone revenue and total revenue to decline year-on-year in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The analyst believes that the iPhone 14 product cycle will have limited impact on demand throughout fiscal year 2023, while the shortage in the first quarter of next year may bring several attractive buying opportunities for long-term investors throughout the year.

In addition, according to the media citing people familiar with the matter, Apple is not seeking to increase more advertising on the iPhone and is satisfied with the current revenue growth.

The third-ranked Amazon closed down 2.32%, with a turnover of 9.82 billion US dollars. Amazon plans to cut about 10,000 jobs and is expected to begin as early as this week. Amazon plans to start cutting about 10,000 jobs across its enterprise and technology divisions as early as this week, people familiar with the matter said, in what would be the largest layoff in the company's history. The job cuts will be concentrated in Amazon's devices division, including its Alexa voice assistant, as well as retail and human resources, the people said.

3804,StockMarket,"Hey everyone,. 

I want to have a discussion on the impacts of these huge layoffs. I keep reading all these articles about how big companies are taking aggressive measures to cut operating cost in the post pandemic climate. First was Twitter, then Meta and now Amazon. It seems the common rhetoric is the CEO's expected the growth of the pandemic to continue but didn't account for it having opposite effects.

I'm just wondering what does this mean for the overall state of the economy? This probably is not the last of the layoffs that we are going to see and what kind of repercussions they will have. Is this just a much needed part of an economy that expanded to quickly for its own good? Or will this bring on bigger problems in the near future? What is the role of large scale layoffs in terms of inflation? My best guess would be it's a deflationary event.

Some obvious things that come to your mind right now would be 

Cash account
Cdf or fake shares 
Buy 100 shares and sell calls deep itm

But NO! it's non of the above in fact you can start doing it tomorrow on your Robinhood margin account or whatever broker you're using with basically any amount of money 

I'm sure this will help many people especially those who have small account's and have been hit with pdt after pdt and had to switch brokers over and over again

Hello friends! I've been trading for 2y3mo and full time trading for almost 7mo's now. Below I will share some practices I use which have helped my trading career, and which I believe will help other's as well.

1.**Journaling**  
Rules are important since they will help inhibit our bad behaviors and improve on our good ones, below I will share my rules. Your rule set is personalized to your with the rest. On top of this, trading can be mentally exhausting! There's no need to stay glued to the screen for hours and hours a day.  
**Things to journal**:  
Realized P/L  
Date/day  
Time of the trade  
Instrument traded  
Type of the trade (reversal, scalp, swing, day trade, TTO, etc)

2.**Rules**  
Rules are important since they will help inhibit our bad behaviors and improve on our good ones, below I will share my rules. Your rule set is personalized to you.

1. Do NOT trade while tired

2. No trading in bed

3. Trade ONLY your A+ setups (reversals)

4 .Morning routine MUST be completed before trading

5. NEVER let a winning position go red

6. The trade MUST be planned before entering (entry, stop, take profits mapped out)

7. Use proper and consistent risk management/size

8. Market prep (watchlist, plan the day, choose your tickers, etc)

9. If you do get emotional, take a 1 hour break

10. Do NOT trade during chop

11. Do NOT trade during events/speeches

12. After 3 loss' stop trading

For those that get emotional or their emotions get in the way of their trading, practice box breathing!! When we get emotional, it can warp our mind and put our nervous system into a fight or flight response causing us to cut trades early, take profits too soon, or not even get into a trade. This is **normal**. Our brain was not designed to partake in uncertain environments and the market is entirely uncertain. (only probability exists in the market). By practicing breathing exercises we can slow down our emotional process and see our charts or positions in a more neutral, focused state.

Surround yourself with individuals/groups who want you to grow and help you reach your goals! The biggest propulsion in my trading career was being around professional traders and learning from them. Don't ever stop being a student, there is always more to learn.

That's all I have for now! Hope this helped :)","Sharing some journaling practices, rules, and techniques which have helped my trading. What are yours?",1668464284

3833,StockMarket,"Amazon is planning to lay off approximately 10,000 employees in corporate and technology roles beginning this week, according to a report from The New York Times.

Shares of Amazon were down about 2.5% on Monday.

The cuts would be the largest in the company‚Äôs history and would primarily impact Amazon‚Äôs devices organization, retail division and human resources, according to the report. The reported layoffs would represent less than 1% of Amazon‚Äôs global workforce and 3% of its corporate employees.

The report follows headcount reductions at other tech firms. Meta announced last week that it‚Äôs laying off more than 13% of its staff, or more than 11,000 employees, and Twitter laid off approximately half its workforce in the days following Elon Musk‚Äôs $44 billion acquisition of the company.

Amazon reported 798,000 employees at the end of 2019 but had 1.6 million full- and part-time employees as of Dec. 31, 2021, a 102% increase. The New York Times said the total number of layoffs ‚Äúremains fluid‚Äù and could change.

A representative from Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The holiday shopping season is critical for Amazon, and usually, one where the company has increased its headcount to meet demand. But Andy Jassy, who took over as CEO in July 2021, has been in cost-cutting mode to preserve cash as the company confronts slowing sales and a gloomy global economy.

The company has already announced plans to¬†freeze hiring¬†for corporate roles in its retail business. In recent months, Amazon shut down¬†its telehealth service,¬†discontinued a quirky, video-calling projector for kids,¬†closed all but one¬†of its U.S. call centers, axed its¬†roving delivery robot, shuttered underperforming¬†brick-and-mortar chains, and is closing, canceling or delaying¬†some new warehouse locations.

Amazon reported disappointing third-quarter earnings in October that spooked investors and caused shares to sink more than 13%. It marked the first time Amazon‚Äôs market cap fell below $1 trillion since April 2020, and the report was the second time this year¬†that Amazon‚Äôs results have been enough to spark a double-digit percentage sell-off. The sell-off continued for days after the report and erased almost all of the stock‚Äôs pandemic surge.

Amazon (AMZN) fell 2.5% following the news that the company is planning to lay off approximately 10,000 employees. AMZN is currently down 41% YTD and is on pace for its worst year since 2008. How much further do you think AMZN price will fall?","Amazon reportedly plans to lay off about 10,000 employees starting this week, would be the largest cuts in the company‚Äôs history.",1668450555

3836,StockMarket,"Scion Asset Management's Michael Burry, known for his timely bets against housing ahead of the 2008 financial crisis, added five new companies to his portfolio in the last quarter including prison operator CoreCivic, filings released on Monday showed.

The move comes after fund manager Burry dumped a dozen positions in the second quarter, including Facebook parent Meta Platforms, and replaced them with a new stake in prison company Geo Group Inc.

A regulatory filing on Monday showed he bought roughly 1.5 million additional shares in Geo Group in the third quarter. At current prices, Scion's position is worth $17.3 million, the biggest in his portfolio. Burry also added $7.8 million stake in CoreCivic, the filing showed.

Other names Scion added in the quarter are telecoms groups Liberty Latin America Ltd and Charter Communications Inc, aerospace and defense company Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc, and video commerce firm Qurate Retail Inc.

Shares in Geo Group, CoreCivic and Aerojet are up year-to-date, outperforming the S&amp;P 500, which is down 16.3% on the year. Liberty and Qurate are down 28.5% and 76% on the year respectively.

Filings known as 13-f are one of the few quarterly disclosures that hedge fund managers make of their long positions - bets that a stock will rise - and may not reflect current holdings.

Fund managers are not required to disclose short positions, which profit when a company's shares fall.

Trading significantly under book value with a low price/sales ratio.  
   
Good day everyone,  
   
**Item 9 Labs Corp. (OTCQX: INLB)**¬†is a vertically integrated canna-bis operator and dispensary franchisor delivering premium products from its large-scale cultivation and production facilities.  
   
**Current price $.27/share (as of market close 11-11-22)**  
   
INLB has been growing like a weed. Anyone with interest in an investment in the canna-bis sector should look at INLB due to their unique, highly profitable model versus other canna-bis companies:  
   
High revenue growth ‚Äì Unique franchise model ‚Äì Currently priced below book value ‚Äì Gross margin of 38% - Award winning product line ‚Äì Total vertical integration. **INLB is trading at 33% of their (mrq) book value of $.81/share.**  
   
INLB is an innovator in the new generation of canna-bis growers and distributors.  
   
2019 revenues¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† $4.9M  
2020 revenues¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† $8.1M  
2021 revenues ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† $21.9M  
2022 (9 months)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† $17.6M (9 months ended 6-30-22)  
   
Analysts covering INLB have estimated FYE 2022 (September 30) revenues at $23.25M and **FYE 2023 revenues at $30M**.  
   
**The current market cap for INLB is only $26M**  
   
Is the canna-bis market still hot? Legal sales of canna-bis in the U.S. grew 40% in 2021 to $25 billion, according to research from BofA Securities. The total U.S. economic impact from canna-bis sales is **expected to reach $160 billion in 2025**.  
   
Headquartered in Arizona, the company is currently expanding its operations space by 650,000+ square feet on its 50-acre site, one of the largest properties in Arizona zoned to grow and cultivate canna-bis flower. The company is also in active development of a 20,000 square foot cultivation and lab facility in Pahrump, Nevada projected to be fully operational by the end of 2022.  
   
INLB is a totally vertical canna-bis operation, they grow quality canna-bis leaves, and create retail products in their processing labs. INLB provides its award-winning canna-bis products to 60% of the dispensaries (estimated at 125 total) located in Arizona.¬† 

&amp;#x200B;

 INLB is a leader in franchising canna-bis dispensaries with their Unity Rd. brand. They have helped entrepreneurs open over 300 of them.  
   
INLB generates revenue from the sale of their award-winning canna-bis products and from the $100,000 license fee for a franchise and 7% of gross sales paid to them by franchisees. Those charges are not untypical in the world of franchised operations.  
   
Like many other business opportunities for individuals to own their own business, franchising in the canna-bis sector is fast becoming the way to go. The entry into owning a canna-bis dispensary can be fraught with hurdles such as regulatory compliance, steady supply of quality products, a poor business model and many more.  
   
Fast food is an example. Many entrepreneurs rush to open a store front with a unique name selling pizza, or burgers, or any other kinds of foods they feel they can make better than the competition. Ultimately, and sadly, more than half of them go out of business too soon. But the franchised fast-food storefronts seem to go on forever. When‚Äôs the last time you noticed that a McDonalds franchise went out of business? **INLB is a member of the International Franchise Association (IFA).**  
   
So, along with selling their home-grown and lab developed canna-bis products throughout the state of Arizona, INLB has those **monthly recurring revenues coming in** from all their Unity Rd. Brand franchisees.  
   
**Recent events at INLB:**  
   
The company earned more than 30 podium finishes at [Arizona marijuana competitions](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/item-9-labs-surpasses-30-125700620.html) for product excellence across their high-quality cannabis flower, pre-roll, concentrate and vape products. The competition was held October 22-23.  
   
In August [the company announced](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/item-9-labs-corp-accelerates-131300100.html) that their Unity Rd. brand had opened four canna-bis retail stores throughout Colorado, Oklahoma and South Dakota and that a pending Canadian retail (Sessions Canna-bis) acquisition would put INLB on track to become one of the world's largest canna-bis retail franchisors.  
   
¬†INLB CEO, Andrew Bowden said, ""Our highly scalable retail model offers local entrepreneurs expert guidance and a roadmap to operating compliantly in canna-bis. On a corporate level, we can rapidly expand our Unity Rd. dispensary footprint with low capital expenditure since franchisees own and operate their locations.""  
   
**INLB Statistics:**

3863,StockMarket,"Goldman Sachs: It's only a matter of time before the Fed raises its inflation target

Goldman believes that raising the inflation target is no longer a question of if, but when. Goldman Sachs unequivocally lays out the dilemma facing politicians and the Fed: Either keep the inflation target at 2% and devastate the economy and markets, or raise it

&amp;#x200B;

Goldman Sachs and a number of economists believe that although inflation does appear to be gradually falling in line with the Fed's target, if the Fed insists on moving towards the 2% target, it will bring huge economic risks and raise the inflation target to 3%. Even higher is ideal.

&amp;#x200B;

The consequences of a recession are too dire, and the Fed's ""curve rescue"" may be the best strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

Last Thursday, the U.S. Department of Labor released data showing that the U.S. CPI in October rose by 7.7% year-on-year, a sharp drop from the previous 8.2%, the lowest level since January; the core CPI rose 6.3% year-on-year, which was also better than market expectations. 6.5%, down from the previous value of 6.6%.

&amp;#x200B;

Weak inflation data boosted market sentiment, with U.S. stock indexes posting their biggest one-day gains since April 2020. The analysis pointed out that the cornerstone that supports the Fed's continued aggressive interest rate hike expectations is U.S. inflation. If inflation falls faster than expected, the Fed will have more room to slow down the pace of interest rate hikes.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this has also prompted many economists to think more long-term: Inflation does appear to be gradually falling in line with the Fed's target, but if the Fed insists on moving towards the 2% target, it will bring huge economic risks - in fact Rising interest rates will cause significant economic damage and worsen public finances, and risk assets will face enormous challenges.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on this, Goldman Sachs and several economists believe that the Fed is very likely to adjust the inflation target to 3% or higher. The good news is that Goldman Sachs also expects core PCE inflation to gradually decline, from the current 5.1% to around 3.5% by the middle of next year and to 2.9% by December next year.","Take a wild guess.

# [Stock futures fall following the S&amp;P 500‚Ä≤s best week since June](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures traded lower Monday after the S&amp;P 500 posted its biggest weekly gain in almost five months on the back of easing inflation data.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 49 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures declined 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures slid by 0.5%.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied 5.9% last week for its best week since June. Investors cheered a lighter-than-expected inflation reading, betting that the Federal Reserve would soon slow its aggressive tightening campaign.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúA notable shift has occurred in the market, with investors increasingly risk-on across asset classes,‚Äù said Mark Hackett, Nationwide‚Äôs chief of investment research. ‚ÄúTechnical indicators have improved dramatically, with investor sentiment, momentum, breadth, and risk factors all showing notable improvement.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 8.1% last week for its best week since March, while the blue-chip Dow advanced 4.2%.
*****
&gt; The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street‚Äôs fear gauge or the VIX, fell 1 point to 22.5, hitting the lowest level since August. The VIX, which tracks the 30-day implied volatility of the S&amp;P 500, had traded above the 30 point threshold for most of October.
*****
&gt; Still, the Federal Reserve has given little signal that it could deviate from its tightening path anytime soon. Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Sunday that, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at a point we can start thinking maybe of going to a slower pace.‚Äù But, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not softening. ... Quit paying attention to the pace and start paying attention to where the endpoint is going to be. Until we get inflation down, that endpoint is still a ways out there.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Investors also digested news on the politics front over the weekend. Democrats will keep control of the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections, NBC News projected. The party will hold at least 50 seats after Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada held off challenges.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the third-quarter earnings season is set to continue, with a heavy emphasis on retail. Big retailers Walmart, Home Depot, Target, Lowe‚Äôs, Macy‚Äôs and Kohl‚Äôs are all slated to post numbers this week.

3875,StockMarket,"As early as when Elon Musk, the world's richest man, first proposed to acquire Twitter, many Tesla investors worried that Musk's acquisition of Twitter would inevitably distract him and affect Tesla's operations. For now, Tesla investor fears appear to be becoming a reality.

""I have too much work to do, that's for sure,"" Musk said at the B20 business conference in Indonesia. ""I'm definitely doing my best, 7 days a week, morning to late night.""

Musk attended the B20 business meeting via video. The B20 meeting is an important supporting activity of the G20 summit. Guests typically include heads of world-renowned companies, international institutions, business associations and other organisations. people and representatives.

As the richest man in the world today, Musk's most dazzling company is Tesla, the leader in electric vehicles. He also controls space exploration company SpaceX, brain-computer interface company Neuralink, and tunnel-digging company Boring Company. Musk also recently completed the acquisition of Twitter Inc., becoming the new owner of the social media company and overhauling it.

Tesla is at a critical juncture in its development, and Musk is used to being personally involved in job-level decisions, from car styling to supply chain issues.

Musk is known for his energy, but he also admits that two-thirds of the ""personal and professional pain"" he's experienced has come from running Tesla, and since the electric car company was founded in 2003, he has Your ""lifetime"" is devoted to this company.

It should be noted that Musk is not the founder of Tesla. He joined the company in 2004 as a Series A investor and became the company's chairman.

Musk brought his unique management experience to the company after taking over Twitter, just a week after he laid off about 50% of Twitter's workforce and eliminated telecommuting.

Musk said: ""Frankly, I torture myself more."" It is reported that at the busiest time, Musk once slept on the floor of the Tesla factory.","Are Tesla investors' fears coming true? Musk: After the acquisition of Twitter, every day is busy from morning to night",1668431883

3877,StockMarket,"Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs fall from grace has dealt an unprecedented blow to the crypto industry‚Äôs reputation ‚Äî and some of this infamy may rub off on politicians who took his money, as well as on former regulators and Capitol Hill staffers who took well-paying jobs representing digital-asset companies before Congress.

Bankman-Fried, founder and CEO of the crumbling cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was one of the most generous donors to political causes during the 2022 election cycle, doling out $40 million, mostly to Democrats, with a particular focus on buoying crypto-friendly politicians in Democratic primaries.

FTX, like many other crypto firms, also aggressively recruited former federal regulators and Capitol Hill staffers, an often-criticized practice but one that has been common in the financial-services industry for decades.

Jeff Hauser, director of the left-leaning Revolving Door Project, said that Democratic politicians who worked closely with Bankman-Fried will have much to explain to the progressive wing of the party.

‚ÄúA lot of people in the Democratic party got really close to Sam Bankman-Fried, and it reflects very badly on people who took this guy seriously,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPeople who in their past lives have taken on corporate power have been bedazzled by money seemingly being thrown their way.‚Äù

Bankman-Fried was the primary funder of the Protect Our Future PAC, which spent tens of millions of dollars in Democratic primaries this year. He also floated the idea of spending upwards of $1 billion in the 2024 presidential election to beat Donald Trump if he were the Republican nominee.

Promises of money on this scale likely tantalized many Democratic politicians, Hauser said, whether or not Bankman-Fried ever planned to go through with those contributions.

The crypto industry has also wielded influence by hiring former Capitol Hill staff and federal financial regulators to lobby and advise them on regulatory matters. The Campaign for Accountability, a nonpartisan anticorruption watchdog, published a report in February that found 240 examples of officials with key positions in the White House, Congress, federal regulatory agencies and national political campaigns moving into and out of the industry.

‚ÄúThe crypto industry is following the standard playbook for advancing special interests in Washington, including using all the levers of the influence industry,‚Äù Dennis Kelleher, president and CEO of the nonpartisan financial-reform organization Better Markets, told MarketWatch. ‚ÄúOne of the most pernicious parts of that is the revolving door, where former officials essentially sell out their public service by using their access and influence on behalf of their private clients.‚Äù

Kelleher praised the performance of federal banking and securities regulators who have succeeded in keeping the carnage in the crypto markets segregated from the traditional financial system as popular tokens like bitcoin BTCUSD, +2.41% and ether ETHUSD, +3.77% lost more than 70% of their value over the past year.

Nevertheless, he believes crypto‚Äôs influence campaign has convinced lawmakers that what‚Äôs needed is to pass legislation that would tailor the financial-regulatory apparatus to be more friendly to the business models of digital-asset companies, rather than increasing funding for market regulators to enforce the regulations already on the books.

A bill put forward in June by Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York would do just that, granting regulatory authority for the most popular cryptocurrencies to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which critics of the bill say is more crypto-friendly than the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Another bipartisan bill from Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, a Democrat, and Sen. John Bozeman of Arkansas, the committee‚Äôs ranking Republican, envisions a similar setup.

Kelleher said that these bills are the product of the crypto industry‚Äôs intense lobbying efforts, and without that push, lawmakers might see that what is needed is more funding to enforce securities laws that already exist.

‚ÄúPeople need to realize that the crypto industry is basically lawless,‚Äù Kelleher said, adding that exchanges like FTX could have made the decision to register as a securities exchange with the SEC, whose supervision would have ensured that the company couldn‚Äôt engage in the type of activities that led to its downfall.

‚ÄúThe industry made the conscious decision to not comply with the law, to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on public officials to get a special law passed so they get special treatment,‚Äù he said.

But after all, there is a funny part.

The company has about 67m$ in cash(!), no debt(!) and the MC is around 40M.. WTH ?

So if we look only at their cash in relation to the market cap the share price should be around the 1$. That's 40% upside.

Revenue increase from year to year, losses decrease from year to year and the stock still going down.

but I think it went down way too much

It is a high risk stock to buy but I think the upside here is crazy. (price was at 7$+- at top).

I guess I will buy a bit and see how it goes.

What do you guys think? You think it worth it or should I leave it?

&amp;#x200B;

According to internal communications shared with the media by full-time Twitter employees, a large number of Twitter contractors found they were abruptly fired this weekend because they lost access to Twitter's chat tool Slack and other work systems.

&amp;#x200B;

An estimated 4,400 of Twitter's 5,500 contract workers have been laid off, according to media reports. The layoffs will have a significant impact on the content moderation and core infrastructure services that keep the site up and running.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of Twitter's contractors work overseas, such as in India. Full-time Twitter employees said they had not received any internal notice until the contractors they worked with were fired.

&amp;#x200B;

Twitter has fired all of its internal communications teams, according to the employees. They also wryly say that the media covering the company is now acting as an internal communication role.

&amp;#x200B;

The latest slimming measures

&amp;#x200B;

The layoffs of contract workers mark Twitter's latest slimming move. Since Musk bought Twitter on Oct. 28, the company has laid off about half of its employees.

&amp;#x200B;

Twitter's co-founder Jack Dorsey has apologized for the company's ""too fast"" expansion after the company implemented mass layoffs.

&amp;#x200B;

As of June 30, 2013, shortly before Twitter went public, the company employed about 2,000 people, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At the end of last year, the company reported that its total number of full-time employees had grown to around 7,500.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding layoffs, Musk tweeted on November 4: ""When the company is losing more than $4 million a day, we have no choice. All laid off people get 3 months of severance pay, which is 50% higher than required by law. %.""

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, Musk issued a ""bankruptcy warning"" to employees and said he was selling Tesla shares to ""save Twitter.""

&amp;#x200B;

The company could have ""billions of dollars in net negative cash flow"" next year, he said at the staff meeting, adding that ""bankruptcy is not out of the question"" if the company doesn't bring in more cash flow than we spend. .",Twitter continues to lose weight!

[Headline MOM PPI](https://i.postimg.cc/BnZf3TPB/image.png)

The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the change in the selling price of goods and services sold by producers. The PPI measures price change from the perspective of the seller. When producers pay more for goods and services, they are more likely to pass the higher costs to the consumer, so PPI is thought to be a leading indicator of consumer inflation.

It became an alternative to traditional IPOs (which stands for initial public offerings).

From 2020 to 2021, SPACs were one of the hottest investments on Wallstreet. Making up for the majority of U.S. IPOs. But by May 2021, activity had sharply declined.

If you're an investor you've probably heard of some of these companies that began trading after merging with a SPAC: Draftkings, Lucid, UWMC, Lilium, Tattooed Chef, etc.

I made a video explaining the downfall of SPACs but since I'm not here for a plug, but to share some information, here it goes:

1st reason: Many ex-SPAC companies deceived investors and committed fraud. See Nikola motors.

2nd reason: The SEC stepped in to regulate since there was so many instances of investors being deceived.

3rd reason: The dilutive nature of going public via SPAC.

If¬† you look at¬†the agenda, Anavex has 7 of their top executives from around¬† the globe presenting‚Ä¶several world renown experts in their fields¬† (McFarlane Rett etc). This is a HUGE deal. This event puts a stake in the ground for¬†results that have been promised for this¬†year. 

Assuming positive results its¬† possible/likely you could¬†see¬†the stock jump from the¬† current (as of Friday) $14.50 to well over $100 per share by Dec 1st.¬† 

The market value for a successful AD trial has already been pegged AT A MINIMUM $20 billion, as seen by BIIB and their recently announced AD trial¬† results‚Ä¶.it added $20 Billion to the market cap overnight. The problem with BIIB is the side effects that include significant brain swelling (Biogen Inc.'s controversial Alzheimer's drug¬†Aduhelm produced brain swelling in 35% of patients who took the approved dose,¬†) ‚Ä¶

AVXL has none¬†of that. Given a successful trial outcome with a clean safety profile, AVXL could¬†command a $40 billion plus market cap. 

You need to understand that a clean safely profile AD drug that works will become the largest selling drug in the world. Another industry player, SAVA, spiked from about $10 per share to over $120 all within a week over the last 24 months.¬† 

Now its AVXL‚Äôs turn.
¬†
Now that you have small back drop..and you can do plenty of¬† your own research, consider the following: 

- Low float (78 million shares),
- Modest market cap compared to market upside (approx. 1 Billion now..with short term target of $20billion plus). 
- Shares short are about 10 million shares. 
- The stock has had significant volume increase in the last 3 trading days‚Ä¶and the share price has started to move.

If you look at¬†the bread crumbs, why would AVXL announce a late breaking presentation in late October, for a Dec 1st presentation of AD trial results..and have their full team there unless there was a strong update on the trial results.¬†In addition CTAD is a SCIENTIFIC conference not an investor conference‚Ä¶and later breaking presentations have to be reviewed and accepted. Logic would¬†say the CTAD staff determined it was meaningful enough for a special late breaking presentation.

AVXL has also indicated that a peer review publication will review/validate the trial¬† results.¬†Combine this with years of positive, safe, trial results‚Ä¶and evidence points heavily to upcoming dramatic and positive set of results. 

This week you will likely see the shorts starting to cover with strong volume. Look for AVXL to be in the $20‚Äôs¬† (perhaps more) before CTAD (Dec 1st). And remember we have only spoken about the AD drug. The Rett and Parkinsons drug could add another another $150 plus per share‚Ä¶AVXL is a multidimensional CNS drug platform with trials and results to prove it.

This is one of those rare events that has the potential¬†to make many people very rich and solve a big problem for humanity.¬† 

Will you be part of it ? The shorts are¬† in quite a box right now with a risk of loosing¬†$100 to $200 per share. So watch the frying pan this week‚Ä¶.and if you like to play..this one may be it‚Ä¶.",Pay To Play: AVXL has the potential to 10X plus in the next 15 Days,1668359196

I would also be interested in hearing how you guys stay on top of the market happenings. Do you set up an Excel sheet where you do comparisons? Maybe you use some program that lets you track your stocks in relation to new information?

3948,StockMarket,"Hey everybody. 

I recently came into a $360.000 investment. I've been following the stock market for quite some time and been dabbling with much smaller sums. On drying that seems certain for me is that there's a lot of volatility right now, and uncertainty about the next 12-ish months. Seems like inflation is steadily peaking and the fed is going to be easing up on the rate hikes. However, am i correct to understand that the consequences of the high rates and inflation have yet to really hit the marker? 

It's a bit daunting to start investing with larger sums of money so i thought I'd run my plan by you guys, see what comes up. Any insights are highly appreciated.

I'm planning on eventually splitting the money between stocks/bonds about 65/35 ( 240/120k), and a small sum for crypto. I won't be picking individual stocks, but will go for broad ETFs. Currently thinking of 
- 40% world
- 30% s&amp;p500
- 10% europe
- 5% emerging markets
- 5% health
- 5% energy
- 5% tech.

Given the high volatility and probability of another dip in the next year, I'd prefer to transition to ETFs slowly. Of the 240k allotted for etf's, I'd keep about 100k immediately available to ease into ETFs at ¬±10.000 a month (sometimes more, sometimes less depending on the situation at the time, but every month without fault) for the first 6 months of 2023. The other 140 I'd invest in short terms bonds (¬±6 months). So they become available when i need them at the 6 month mark. At that point i decide how to proceed ( get into ETFs quicker or again invest a percentage in short term bonds an repeat the proces), from there with hopefully a little more certainty about the state of the market.

My thinking is that this way i get the secure, relatively high returns from the short term bonds while easing into etf's and still having a small buffer available to invest larger sums should the market take a dive. Overall, I'd reach the 65/35 etf/bond ratio and become fully invested in 18-24 months. 

Ver interested to hear your thoughts. Any i sights are highly appreciated.

Thank you.",inheritance Investment plan thoughts,1668305309

**‚ÄúI am deeply sorry that we find ourselves in this current situation,‚Äù wrote Zhou. ‚ÄúWe will work tirelessly to maximise our chances of recovering stuck capital by any means.‚Äù**

He added that it could take **‚Äúa few years‚Äù to recover ‚Äúsome percentage‚Äù of its assets.**

**Industry insiders say that the fact FTX was used by so many hedge funds and seen as one of the world‚Äôs safer crypto trading venues means many managers may have money stuck on the exchange.**

Galois did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

**Galois is one of the industry‚Äôs biggest crypto-focused quant funds and, as of this summer, it was managing more than $200mn in assets.** A major part of its trading activity is as a market maker, allowing it to make tiny gains on other investors‚Äô trades.

**Zhou, who worked at digital exchange Kraken before setting up Galois, is well known for his early criticism of cryptocurrency luna and its linked stablecoin terraUSD, ahead of their $40bn collapse in May.**

He said in the letter that his fund had been left with the money in FTX because it had ‚Äúa ton of open positions‚Äù that it had to close and due to **‚Äúunderappreciating the solvency risk with holding our funds at FTX‚Äù**.¬†

He added that if FTX did file for bankruptcy, then Galois would become a creditor.

If that happened, then **‚ÄúI expect we will recover some percentage of our assets on FTX over the course of a few years,‚Äù he said.**

Does the timer that counts down ""1 Year+""  start at your first contribution (the initial purchase of the stock/fund) or does it reset every time that you contribute?

Wilson, a well-known stock market skeptic, correctly predicted this year's plunge in U.S. stocks. ""The U.S. stock market is likely to rise further, possibly through Thanksgiving or even into early December,"" Morgan Stanley chief strategist Wilson said in an interview with the media on Friday. ""I don't think the current rally is over.

U.S. stocks had their best day since April 2020 on Thursday, in part because investors' latest inflation report found, The previous bet may have been too aggressive and had to reverse the course. It is reported that the S&amp;P 500 rebounded sharply 5.54% on Thursday, the biggest gain in more than two years.

The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) released on Thursday cooled more than market expectations in October, greatly increasing the possibility that the Federal Reserve's monetary policy will turn dovish ahead of schedule. If interest rate expectations start to fall back, that would help ease pressure on longer-term assets such as growth stocks, which could help fuel the next rally in stocks, Wilson said.

CME Group's FedWatch tool shows that after the release of the US CPI data in October, the market's expectations for the peak range of the Fed's interest rate and the duration of interest rate maintenance after the peak have cooled significantly. The peak range has been lowered from the previous 5%-5.25% to 4.75%- 5%, and the market expects interest rates to peak until September next year, rather than the end of next year as previously expected.

""With interest rates falling ... the Nasdaq, which has lagged in this rally so far, is now rising."" ""This is directly related to changes in interest rate expectations,"" Wilson stressed.

Wilson also noted that despite the sell-off in cryptocurrencies following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs crypto empire FTX, the U.S. stock market did not take a hit and remained firm.

""Clearly, this threat from cryptocurrencies is not constructive,"" Wilson said. ""We're going through this and it's kind of scary, but the market is going up... which tells me that people don't care about this negative thing...""

Wilson has previously said U.S. stocks are very close to a bear market bottom and reiterated that the S&amp;P 500 could rally to 4,000 to 4,150 points, but warned he still sees the recent rally as an oversold rally ‚Äî at least for now.

""We do think this is ultimately an oversold rally in a bear market,"" Wilson said. But he explained that once the S&amp;P 500 crosses its 200-day moving average (currently around 4,081), it could ""stimulate the market's animal spirits"" and attract more passive inflows. That could push the S&amp;P 500 as high as 4,200 and possibly 4,300, he added. On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.92% to 3,992.93.

""The market will continue to exhibit extreme volatility,"" Wilson warned. ""The U.S. stock market is still in a bear market right now, so it could still tear you to shreds.""","Wall Street's big bears continue to be optimistic about the short-term market of U.S. stocks, the S&amp;P 500 may hit 4300 points",1668224091

It's quite simple, I can download the historical data to a flat file and have an automation tool load the data into a database into tables then write my logic there based on the historical data. A lot more techy stuff, but the end result is it will output what it thinks the likelihood of a put or call making them gains.

From the announcement:

&gt; Palantir Skykit brings intelligence and operations to the edge. It is a fully disconnected intelligence center giving soldiers an advantage over adversaries. Skykit is powered by Palantir software including Meta-Constellation and AIP, allowing users to task and analyze data from anywhere.

There‚Äôs limited news out at the moment, but my understanding is this will be an ‚Äúintelligence center in a box‚Äù which soldiers can use in the field to make better decisions. Each unit comes equipped with built in laptops, monitors, drones, battery power supply, and a satellite link to access continuous feed from all overhead satellite images of the area. All running on Palantir software which analyzes that collected data to flag potential threats and points of interest. 

Thoughts? The DoD has the fattest piggy bank of any organization or company on earth. Palantir already being ingrained as their core software provider and now moving to also provide hardware seems like a guarantee of increased ‚Äúsafe‚Äù revenue as well as much better opportunities to be selected for future contracts. This is a stock that burned a lot of people over the past 2 years but they‚Äôve been making a lot of good moves lately and are expected to turn profitable in 2023.

It looks like Amazon is preparing for some tough times ahead, with the company taking out an $8 billion unsecured loan and reportedly planning for workforce reductions. While some may see this as a sign of trouble, I see it as a buying opportunity.

Yes, Amazon's stock dropped 50% last year and the macroeconomic environment is uncertain. But with peak inflation hopefully behind us and a consumer base that is still in good shape, I believe there's potential for an upside surprise in the near future. And who better to lead the company through these challenges than Jeff Bezos himself? It's been less than two years since he stepped down as CEO, and if Bob Iger can make a successful return to Disney, why not Bezos at Amazon?

Newron Valuation Report
‚ÄúBack to pivotal‚Äù
Evenamide data provides a brilliant start to the New Year

Despite exciting 6-month interim results of the first 100 patients enrolled in ‚ÄúStudies 014/015‚Äù of evenamide in TRS, Newron trades just above its cash value. Xadago, its marketed drug for Parkinson‚Äôs disease, and its key driver, evenamide for schizophrenia, are virtually free. Further clinical progress of evenamide in schizophrenia and starting the PD-LID label extension trial for Xadago should add significantly to the value while reducing the clinical development risk. Moreover, the exciting ‚ÄúStudies 014/015‚Äù interim data might trigger a potential global partnering deal with a major CNS player earlier than expected, providing further equity upside.

Key catalysts include:
1. Full results ‚ÄúStudy 014‚Äù trial of evenamide in TRS (March 2023)
2. Start new label trial Xadago in PD-LID (H1 2023)
3. Results pivotal ‚ÄúStudy 008A‚Äù trial of evenamide in non-TRS (H2 2023)

143,wallstreetbets,"Hey WallStreetBets Community,

I know this is going to be a controversial opinion, but hear me out. I think that the current obsession with short-term gains is doing more harm than good for the stock market.

I understand that the allure of quick profits is tempting, but constantly buying and selling stocks based on short-term trends is ultimately destabilizing for the market. It creates unnecessary volatility and can even lead to market crashes.

Instead, I think it would be more beneficial for investors to focus on long-term growth. This means taking the time to research and carefully select stocks that have the potential for sustainable growth over a period of years, rather than just looking for a quick buck.

I know this kind of thinking goes against the grain of WallStreetBets, but I think it's important to consider the long-term effects of our actions on the market (example Warren Buffet).

I know this is going to be a controversial opinion, but I think we need to start considering the long-term implications of our investments on the overall economy. I know we all want to make as much money as possible, but I think we need to start considering the ethical implications of our actions.

For example, investing in companies that have a history of exploiting their workers or engaging in unethical business practices might make us a quick buck, but it ultimately hurts society as a whole. It's short-sighted to only focus on our own profits at the expense of the well-being of others.

I'm not saying we should completely avoid these types of investments, but I think we should at least consider the bigger picture and try to make a positive impact with our investments. It might mean taking a slightly lower return in the short-term, but I believe it's the responsible thing to do.

Google buys stocks back and Sundar takes 242,000,000 every year worth from these treasury stocks. This makes the Google stock buybacks worthless.

All management is taking treasury stocks in the form of compensation (bonuses). In short, all Google managers are diluting the company and existing Google stockholders are fucked.

Google is doomed. 

The only way Google can bounce up is to stop compensation in the form of Google stocks and just pay Google employees a salary, starting with the CEO Sundararajan. 

Google needs to continue making stockbuybacks and it must stop its CEO from taking more Google treasury stocks.

This will be the end of Google is Sundar doesn't stop.

Google doesn't even pay dividends. Stockholders are double fucked. There is nothing that motivates people to buy Google stock.

Silvergate Bank is a financial institution that primarily serves cryptocurrency companies. It provides cryptocurrency exchanges and investors with bank accounts and operates a network that connects these investors to exchanges. The bank is well-known for having a high percentage of cryptocurrency-related deposits, which account for roughly 90% of total deposits.. Silvergate Bank has contributed significantly to the growth of the cryptocurrency industry by providing a dependable banking solution for companies in the space.

# What is going on?

As the crypto market continues to face challenges, Silvergate Bank has found itself at the center of the storm. The collapse of FTX triggered a rush of withdrawals totaling $8.1 billion, leading Silvergate to sell assets at a loss in order to cover these withdrawals. The resulting $718 million loss far exceeds the bank's profits since at least 2013

In response to the crisis, Silvergate has made significant changes to its operations. The bank has laid off 40% of its staff, or around 200 employees, and plans to scale back its businesses. It has also abandoned its plans to launch its own digital currency, writing off the $196 million it invested in technology developed by Facebook for its failed crypto-based payments network.

As a bank that primarily serves the crypto industry, Silvergate operates a network linking investors to crypto exchanges. FTX and other companies controlled by its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, made up around $1 billion of the bank's deposits. The collapse of these companies in November sent shockwaves through the crypto market, leading to a sharp drop in Silvergate's stock.

Despite the steep decline in deposits, Silvergate's unique business model of providing bank accounts to crypto exchanges and investors, as well as its high percentage of crypto-related deposits (90%), allowed it to weather the storm. Additionally, Silvergate remains committed to the crypto industry and has the resources to handle a sustained downturn, with more cash on hand and debt securities that can be quickly sold at the end of Q4. Furthermore, the bank's network saw an increase in daily average volume during this time.

In the past three months, Silvergate's stock has dropped more than 70% and is heavily shorted. While the trade has been profitable for shorts, with profits of over $400 million in the past year, the stock saw a rally of 27% on Wednesday, its best percentage gain since 2020.

#  How can this affect my crypto assets?

Silvergate is a major player in the industry and its failure could cause a ripple effect among other companies in the crypto space.

If Silvergate were to go bankrupt, it could potentially disrupt the operations of the companies it serves and lead to a loss of confidence in the cryptocurrency market more broadly. It could also lead to financial losses for companies that rely on Silvergate's services and potentially create uncertainty among investors.

================================================================================

The moral of the story is :

If you think that the current state of the cryptocurrency market represents a good opportunity for investment and you have confidence in the future potential of cryptocurrencies, then investing in Silvergate could be a smart move.

In fact, if the market reaches a market cap of $10T in the coming years, it could potentially lead to crazy returns of 500K USD/BTC, given its current price of around $17,000.

However, if you are concerned about the economy or believe that the price of bitcoin will decline below $16,000, it may be best to stay away from the crypto market.

It is important to be careful with the amount you invest and to be aware that the value of your investments could temporarily go down, but in the long run (2024-2027), the cryptocurrency market has the potential to generate significant returns like no other market out there.

Company Analysis: JFBR is a premium conglomerate of e-commerce consumer goods that primarily operates on the Amazon platform. Its customers are primarily online individual consumers and resellers who source products primarily on the Amazon US and Amazon EU marketplaces. And quickly established a good basic relationship and brand awareness among consumers. JFBR's advantages lie in traffic, users, and advertising. Judging from the data, the correlation between the three is not strong. Because user growth is still the main growth method of JFBR, thanks to their perfect service system and strong strategic goals.

The advantages of the Amazon platform where JFBR is located are mainly manifested in several aspects: First, the user base. As a shopping platform, Amazon's users account for a large proportion of the total population. In the United States, almost one out of every three people uses Amazon's services. With this user base, Amazon pays a lot of attention to products. The second is the huge scale and efficient distribution system. JFBR has now taken the lead in the EU market and continues to grow. In terms of shareholding, institutions are also more optimistic about JFBR's future development prospects. Since the Q3 quarter, the number of shares held has been increased, and the stock price is expected to usher in a turnaround after more than a month of precipitation.

* Based on the technical analysis, you can expect a 1000% increase in stock price!

  

* **This company is divesting its non-performing assets and will continue to be divested**

FLJ is a company that lease apartments from landlords and transform these apartments. 

In last FLJ's prospectus, as stated in F-3 SEC filling report: ‚ÄúOn October 26, 2021, we transferred all of our equity interest in the WFoE, to Wangxiancai Limited, which is beneficially owned by the legal representative and executive director of one of our subsidiaries, a related party (the Equity Transfer). The WFoE has a series of contractual arrangements with the ViE. Through the ViE entities, we carried out certain rental apartment operation business prior to the Equity Transfer.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs of the date hereof, **we have initiated bankruptcy proceedings with respect to major VIE entities**.‚Äù

[  P1 F-3 Description](https://preview.redd.it/60ch1mknx8aa1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3bac9082929b0366984cad9c848d09a63c93b3d9)

During its latest SEC 6-K filling, the ViE entities contributed only 0.4% of FLJ consolidated revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2022. But carry over 54% liabilities which worth over Ôø•1,552,194,000. Therefore, since its keep transferring its debts to WFoE, I think FLJ's liabilities will be significantly reduced, and the revenue will not be affected at all.

  

* **$FLJ assets will increase over 232%, debts will decrease over 98%, shareholders‚Äô deficit will GONE, in its next earning report!**

As FLJ will keep divesting non-performing assets, I estimate the next financial report for FLJ will make huge changes. As discussed, since FLJ will divest most of its liabilities while retaining as much of its main business as possible, the following tables shows what will likely to happen: 

[  P3 Estimate financial statement ](https://preview.redd.it/ojk6ky6xx8aa1.jpg?width=1100&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f027c2c47e9b612baa57e742fb8e32bd7569e1fd)

Since deposit are normally one month rent from tenants. Therefore, rents receivable from April 1 to September 30 is Ôø•56,170,000 \* 6=Ôø•337,020,000. Which lead the total  assets increase to Ôø•482,214,000, as they keep divested the financial liabilities, it will likely to decrease its liabilities to Ôø•56,170,000. 

That‚Äôs 232% increase in total assets, over 98% decrease in liabilities! Which is huge financial condition change for a company like this! Therefore, the next earning will cause stock price to go up significantly!

* **Based on the technical analysis, you can expect a 1000% increase in stock price!**

From technical side of analysis, I noticed there have been several days of unusual volume. And this abnormal volume of secondary market trade already pull this stock back to uptrend. The recent support level is around $2.1 and resistance level is around $3.87. If FLJ keep going up and breaks $3.87, it will targeting $20!

Conclusion

To sum up, $ FLJ (NASDAQ: FLJ) is the most promising stock I have ever seen. And I truly believe this will become the next GME in 2023. It will not even take too long, the next financial report will show you how crazy this stock will go.

Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickersFundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment‚Äôs price.I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.|

|Things to consider when finding the plays-¬∑ If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.¬∑ If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play. (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.)¬∑ The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.|

287,wallstreetbets,"**Here are the best-performers from 2022 that Cramer believes could continue to see gains this year:**

**Halliburton -** Cramer predicted that the stock has a multiyear rally ahead of it.

**Constellation Energy -** The company will likely be a big beneficiary of funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, he said, adding that he believes Constellation Energy is the best operator of nuclear plants.

**Enphase Energy -** Calling it the ‚Äúrenewable golden boy,‚Äù Cramer said the solar energy technology company is a profitable, solid business.

**McKesson -** Stocks of drug distributors such as McKesson tend to work well during an economic slowdown, he said.

**Northrop Grumman -** The company‚Äôs stock could be the best defense contractor to own as the war between Russia and Ukraine continues, according to Cramer.

**Here are the worst performers from 2022 that he believes could mount a comeback this year:**

**Netflix -** ‚ÄúI believe Netflix has turned itself around because they were so confident on that last conference call. You know, for almost two years, their conference calls were funereal, even when Squid Game took the world by storm,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúAnd lots of growth-oriented money managers want to find improving franchises, and that fits Netflix to a tee.‚Äù

**Stanley Black &amp; Decker** \- Investors interested in the stock should start a small position here and gradually buy more on the way down, he recommended.

**VF Corp** \- Cramer said that while VF Corp stock had a ‚Äúhorrendous performance‚Äù last year, he‚Äôs betting that new interim CEO Benno Dorer will help the company return value to shareholders in 2023.

**Meta Platforms** \- Cramer said that while the stock has been a ‚Äúdisaster,‚Äù he believes that the metaverse will either take off or fizzle out this year. The former scenario would be good news for the company, while the latter would mean the company could divert its metaverse budget to other segments such as Reels and WhatsApp, he said.

**Advanced Micro Devices** \- He said that while AMD stock has been battered by waning demand in personal computers this year, he‚Äôs still a believer of CEO Lisa Su and the company‚Äôs underlying business.

On Jan 4, the three major indexes all closed higher. At the close, the Dow rose 0.4%, the Nasdaq was up 0.69%, and the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.74%.

.

The 10-year US Treasury yield dropped 1.628% to 3.687%, compared with a yield spread of -67 bps over the two-year note while VIX was down 3.89%. Brent crude closed down 5.26%. Spot gold closed up 0.84% at $1,855.15 an ounce. The dollar index was down 0.39%, closing at 104.26.

.

Three key takeaways from the minutes of the December meeting, released on Jan. 4, 2023, are that Fed officials will still be data-dependent in deciding how much to raise rates at future meetings. Second, no one on the FOMC is considering cutting rates in 2023; Finally, the fear that markets are too optimistic and that if they underestimate the Fed's determination to keep rates high through 2023, financial conditions loosen uncomfortably, reducing the Fed's effectiveness in controlling inflation.

296,wallstreetbets,"Amazon.com Inc. is laying off more than 18,000 employees ‚Äî the biggest reduction in its history ‚Äî in the latest sign that a tech-industry slump is deepening.

Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy announced the cuts, which represent about 1% of Amazon‚Äôs employees, in a memo to staff Wednesday, saying it followed the company‚Äôs annual planning process.

The eliminations began last year and were previously expected to affect about 10,000 people. The move is concentrated in the firm‚Äôs corporate ranks, mostly Amazon‚Äôs retail division and human resources functions, like recruiting.

‚ÄúAmazon has weathered uncertain and difficult economies in the past, and we will continue to do so,‚Äù Jassy said. ‚ÄúThese changes will help us pursue our long-term opportunities with a stronger cost structure.‚Äù

Though the prospect of layoffs has loomed over Amazon for months ‚Äî the company has acknowledged that it hired too many people during the pandemic ‚Äî the increasing total suggests the company‚Äôs outlook has darkened. It joins other tech giants in making major cuts. Earlier Wednesday, Salesforce Inc. announced plans to eliminate about 10% of its workforce and reduce its real estate holdings.

337,wallstreetbets," Amazon has announced that it will be laying off over 18,000 employees from its corporate ranks. The layoffs will primarily impact the company's e-commerce and human resources departments, and represent a significant percentage of Amazon's corporate workforce, which numbers around 300,000 people. CEO Andy Jassy cited the uncertain economy and rapid hiring in recent years as contributing factors to the decision.

‚ÄúBack to pivotal‚Äù
Evenamide data provides a brilliant start to the New Year

Despite exciting 6-month interim results of the first 100 patients enrolled in ‚ÄúStudies 014/015‚Äù of evenamide in TRS, Newron trades just above its cash value. Xadago, its marketed drug for Parkinson‚Äôs disease, and its key driver, evenamide for schizophrenia, are virtually free. Further clinical progress of evenamide in schizophrenia and starting the PD-LID label extension trial for Xadago should add significantly to the value while reducing the clinical development risk. Moreover, the exciting ‚ÄúStudies 014/015‚Äù interim data might trigger a potential global partnering deal with a major CNS player earlier than expected, providing further equity upside.

Key catalysts include:
1. Full results ‚ÄúStudy 014‚Äù trial of evenamide in TRS (March 2023)
2. Start new label trial Xadago in PD-LID (H1 2023)

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-criticism-lulas-economic-plans-151648109.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-criticism-lulas-economic-plans-151648109.html)

Lula's policy is a worker's policy. So, from what I know, Petrobas is going to lose a lot of value in the coming years until they can regain control over their company, which requires a different president or for the current one to change policy, which wont' happen. I'm concerned about other investments having similar issues, like Vale mining.

My average cost in Vale is close to 18 per share. It's starting to drop, which is fine in normal conditions, but this might be a bad sign, or a good sign to buy more when the stock goes down enough. Like around $12 or $10. I'm just wondering what more educated people on here would do based on past experiences. Is this the kind of political situation where it's not going to affect all Brazil's stocks, only the ones where the president takes over the company's prices/operations, or will this be a new turn in their economy and I should get the hell out?

I just never dealt with South America until I bought this stock so I have no clue what it's like down there.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, we will be discussing the ""Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee December 13-14, 2022.""

**Quick Summary for Those in a Hurry**

The main takeaway is that the FOMC is taking actions to maintain stability in financial markets and support economic growth by keeping the federal funds rate within a certain range and managing the supply of reserves in the banking system. The FOMC expects economic activity to expand at a pace below its trend growth rate in 2023, and notes that recent economic indicators showed modest growth in spending and production, but strong job gains and low unemployment. However, the FOMC also notes that inflation remains elevated due to various factors and is above the Committee's goal of 2%. There is considerable uncertainty around the consumer spending outlook, and the FOMC expects housing activity to remain weak. Investment spending has appeared modest and is being restrained by high borrowing costs and slow growth in final demand. The FOMC also discusses a number of other issues, including international economic developments, the energy and agricultural sectors, and the labor market.

Overall, the FOMC's outlook for the economy is mixed. While there have been some positive developments, such as strong job gains and low unemployment, there are also ongoing concerns about inflation, slow growth, and imbalances in the labor market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Committee Policy Action**

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has directed the Desk to take certain actions starting on December 15, 2022 in order to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4¬º to 4¬Ω percent. 

These actions include conducting open market operations as needed, conducting overnight repurchase agreements with a minimum bid rate of 4.5 percent and an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion, conducting overnight reverse repurchase agreements at an offering rate of 4.3 percent with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day, rolling over principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities at a monthly cap of $60 billion, reinvesting principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at a monthly cap of $35 billion, and engaging in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions to facilitate the settlement of agency MBS transactions.

The stated amounts for reinvestments may be allowed to deviate modestly if necessary for operational reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

**FOMC OUTLOOK**

&amp;#x200B;

FOMC noted that recent economic indicators showed modest growth in spending and production, but strong job gains and low unemployment. This is generally seen as a positive development, as a healthy labor market is crucial for overall economic health.

However, the FOMC also noted that inflation remained elevated due to a variety of factors, including supply and demand imbalances, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. This is a concern because high inflation can erode purchasing power and make it more difficult for households and businesses to plan for the future.

Looking ahead, the FOMC expects economic activity to expand at a pace below its trend growth rate in 2023. This suggests that the economy may not be as strong as it has been in recent years, but it is also seen as a positive sign that the FOMC expects growth to return over time.

In terms of consumer spending, the FOMC reported that it has shown stronger growth in recent months, likely supported by a strong labor market and households running down excess savings. 

However, there is considerable uncertainty around the consumer spending outlook, and the FOMC expects housing activity to remain weak.

In terms of investment spending, the FOMC noted that it has appeared modest and is being restrained by high borrowing costs and an outlook for the slow growth of final demand. This is a concern because investment is an important driver of long-term economic growth.

The FOMC also discussed a number of other issues, including international economic developments, the energy and agricultural sectors, and the labor market. In particular, the FOMC noted that the labor market has remained very tight, with an unemployment rate near a historically low level, robust payroll gains, and a high level of job vacancies. However, there are also signs that labor market imbalances may be improving, including declines in job openings and quits and reports of more qualified job applicants for open positions.

Despite these positive developments, the FOMC noted that there is still a large imbalance between labor supply and demand, as indicated by the still-large number of job openings and elevated nominal wage growth. This suggests that the labor market may not be as strong as it appears on the surface.

In terms of inflation, the FOMC noted that it is unacceptably high, at above the Committee's goal of 2%. While there have been welcome reductions in the monthly pace of price increases, the FOMC believes that more evidence is needed to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path. Some measures show that firms' markups are still elevated, and a continued subdued expansion in aggregate demand may be needed to reduce the remaining upward pressure on inflation.

 The FOMC believes that the appropriate stance of monetary policy is accommodative in order to support the recovery and return inflation to its goal over time‚Ä¶..

Overall, the FOMC's outlook for the economy is mixed. While there have been some positive developments, such as strong job gains and low unemployment, there are also ongoing concerns about inflation, slow growth, and imbalances in the labor market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bullish factors to consider may include:**

The FOMC is taking action to maintain stability in financial markets and support economic growth.

Recent economic indicators showed modest growth in spending and production, as well as strong job gains and low unemployment.

The FOMC expects economic activity to expand at a pace below its trend growth rate in 2023, indicating that growth is expected to return over time.

Consumer spending has shown stronger growth in recent months, potentially supported by a strong labor market and households running down excess savings.

The labor market has remained very tight, with an unemployment rate near a historically low level, robust payroll gains, and a high level of job vacancies. There are also signs that labor market imbalances may be improving.

&amp;#x200B;

Some potential bearish factors to consider may include:

Inflation remains elevated due to various factors and is above the FOMC's goal of 2%.

There is considerable uncertainty around the consumer spending outlook and the FOMC expects housing activity to remain weak.

Investment spending has been modest and is being restrained by high borrowing costs and slow growth in final demand.

There is still a large imbalance between labor supply and demand, as indicated by the still-large number of job openings and elevated nominal wage growth.

* ¬∑ Fed officials were not pleased by the surge in stocks (easing in financial conditions) ahead of the meeting, warning against an ‚Äúunwarranted‚Äù easing in financial conditions:
   *  *""Participants noted that, because monetary policy worked importantly through financial markets,* ***an unwarranted easing in financial conditions, especially if driven by a misperception by the public of the Committee's reaction function, would complicate the Committee's effort*** *to restore price stability.""*
* ¬∑ **Slowing rate hikes is not pivoting:**
   *  *""Participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective. A number of participants emphasized that it would be important to clearly communicate that a slowing in the pace of rate increases was not an indication of any weakening of the Committee's resolve to achieve its price-stability goal or a judgment that inflation was already on a persistent downward path.""*
* ¬∑ **""Few"" signs of a wage-price spiral**
   *  *""Participants noted that, in the latest inflation data, the pace of increase for prices of core services excluding shelter‚Äîwhich represents the largest component of core PCE price inflation‚Äîwas high. They also remarked that this component of inflation has tended to be closely linked to nominal wage growth and therefore would likely remain persistently elevated if the labor market remained very tight. Consequently, while there were few signs of adverse wage-price dynamics at present, they assessed that bringing down this component of inflation to mandate-consistent levels would require some softening in the growth of labor demand to bring the labor market back into better balance.""*
* ¬∑ FOMC inflation forecasts:
   *  *""****Core goods inflation was anticipated to slow further,*** *housing services inflation was expected to peak in 2023 and then move down, while core non-housing services inflation was forecast to move down as wage growth eased.""*
* ¬∑  **risks are skewed to the upside for inflation but downside for growth**
   *  *""With inflation still elevated, the staff continued to view the* ***risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside. ""***
   *  *""Moreover, the sluggish growth in real private domestic spending expected over the next year, a subdued global economic outlook, and persistently tight financial conditions were seen as tilting the risks to the downside around the baseline projection for real economic activity, and the staff still* ***viewed the possibility of a recession sometime over the next year as a plausible alternative to the baseline""***
* ¬∑ QT:
   *  *""Staff indicated that they would* ***continue to monitor money market conditions closely as balance sheet reduction proceeds.""***

* ¬∑ Bloomberg Economics' Anna Wong summarized as follows:
   *  ‚Äú**Minutes reveal that Fed staff are cautious about interpreting recent data as showing a definitive decline in inflation.** For example, they note that the falling inflation compensation implied by TIPS is due to a decline in risk premiums rather than inflation expectations.
   *  ‚ÄúStaff point to job-openings data moving down in October. However, **JOLTS data for November (released today) showed an upward revision to October‚Äôs job openings,** and the vacancy-to-unemployed ratio actually edged back up in November.
   *  ‚ÄúStaff sound **more alarmed about nominal wage growth than in previous FOMC minutes,** hinting that the underlying pace might be running at 5%.‚Äù

So fed still is scared inflation hasn‚Äôt peaked‚Ä¶ and they are worried about the strength of the economy.

When we take a look at the daily here you can see we are still in this blue consolidation channel and are still also in a red breakout/down triangle. Today we closed back over 383 for only the second time since December 21st. However, we did reject at the daily 20ema yet again. 

The daily 20ema has historically been an area of key rejection and until we can truly break through that which also would be a break through of this blue consolidation channel its hard to feel bullish. 

Realistically we remain stuck in this 376.6 to 386.3 channel until further notice. With the structure of this triangle and blue channel we actually could find ourselves trading here until CPI on January 12th (next Thursday). 

Key support- 383.1 -&gt; 380.8 -&gt; 379.6 -&gt; 378.1

Key resistance- 384.3 -&gt; 386.4 -&gt; 388

Tomorrow brings yet again some more economic data and much like this mornings I do not think it will be received very well.

Futures has such a nice consolidation channel going with such perfectly held levels its hard not to admire it. Today we came down and confirmed 3842 as support. However in the same motion we also rejected at 3875. 

With that daily 20ema rejection and a long wick off that rejection we should favor a slight bearish movement going forward. However, we continue to hold support extremely well. Much like SPY until we see this blue consolidation channel hard break we are just stuck in this range. 

Key support- 3875 -&gt; 3842 -&gt; 3805

Key resistance- 3895 -&gt; 3910 -&gt; 3920

We are now at day two of our sell off and still have about 8-9% more to go minimally.

Taking a look at the daily chart here you can see that we ended up established 109 as a very nice support area and actually formed a pretty nice double double bottom here. This pattern actually should provide a bigger upside push. This inside day that we had today though should provide a continuation pattern downward though despite the bullish appearing double double bottom holding 109 support. 

We are coming in very close to that red falling wedge resistance line though. 112.4 remains resistance to hold the red falling wedge integrity. 

100.5 is the support of that darker red support line which is the 2022/23 bear channel the tesla has been trading in. If we were to lose that support that would really open a bigger down side and be quite the blow to the technical. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I was expecting we ended up getting that morning doji star pattern playing out today on the VIX. I was suspecting to see some upward movement on the VIX today and with the FOMC minutes out and really nothing too major to move the VIX until next weeks CPI we should see the VIX start to unwind slightly into the end of this week. 

However, as we go into CPI week next week we actually could see in the 2-3 days leading into CPI the VIX start a move up again. 

However with the support dating back to December 22nd breaking today and closing under 20ema but at the 8ema this should be a bullish favortism for the markets the rest of the week. 

However, if market digests the next two mornings of heavy data badly or bearishly we could see SPY drop despite this set up.

Took a small red day today. Tough day to trade with the extreme choppy morning followed by an impressive sell off that immediately led into a pump before minutes. Historically we have seen a nice pump on minutes despite them being bearish, however, they were not received very well today. 

For me playing a high probability play and losing doesn‚Äôt bother me much. It‚Äôs the same with a high probability set up based on my trading rules/ technical. Not every trade will be green and not ever trade is going to be that big winner. But in trading we take the highest probability trades. Sometimes we win sometimes we lose. Today we lost.

TRADING IN CASH ACCOUNTS - FREE RIDING
Dear Trader,


""Free riding"" is a term used to describe the practice of buying and selling shares or other securities without actually having the capital to cover the trade. In a cash account, an investor must pay for the purchase of a security (meaning the trade must settle) before selling that security. If an investor buys a security and then sells that same security without paying for that security in full by the settlement date, the investor is considered to be ""free riding."" IBKR has long had surveillance to detect free-riding in cash accounts, but up to now that surveillance has not detected same-day round-trips in options. 

Effective after the New York close on January 9, 2023, IBKR will begin to apply the free-riding surveillance to all securities types (i.e., Stocks, ETFs, Bonds, Options, Warrants, Mutual Funds, etc.) other than US Treasuries (which are exempt). Free-riding violations will result in an account being placed in a ‚Äú90-day freeze‚Äù ‚Äì i.e., those accounts will not be able to make purchases except with settled cash in their account for 90-days",Does this mean we can only sell after 48 hours (settlement),1672866640

&gt;This is not a post about positive nor negative price predictions. Especially with the reverse split + APE dilution \[to pay off debt so could be bad for price but could be long term good, **I dont know**\]. I cant make a prediction here one way or the other. I just wanted to point at some information and data about CTB, FTDs, share availability and price.

&amp;#x200B;

# My look at AMC Cost to borrow:

&amp;#x200B;

[May 2021-May 2022 borrow fee \[green red candles\]](https://preview.redd.it/1ffdhwve73aa1.png?width=1262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5997fbf359f495c78fc44cd016cb3f173a9bd396)

For a long time we have seen cost to borrow at near or under 2% borrow fee for AMC which is normal in the markets. Usually a 0.3-3% fee is fine. This suggested the demand to short was not high. To me this doesnt make that much sense but I will accept that. No matter what occurred with price, or the scarcity of shares the borrow fee stayed the same. I found that quiet strange. Borrow fee seemed to not matter. Any day you look it was roughly 2%.

Now since the 12 month drought in CTB rising we finally saw some movement in CTB.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n0g6yin483aa1.png?width=1256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd64226aec8570bfc32389ab931ba7b25dd54dd4

Now while the stock remains at 100% utilization (according to Ortex) whatever shares did hit the market seemed to finally have some form of reflection of the demand in the borrow fees. Surges in borrow fee from 2% to 20%, 40%, 100%, 140%. Coming down every time and establishing higher lows and eventually meeting higher highs in borrow rates.

As of recently, I have noticed the lender spiking the borrow fee and slowly lowering it to find the sweet spot that borrowers of the shares are willing to borrow. Here for instance they lowered it to 81.1% and finally shares were taken and boom a move up to 82%.

https://preview.redd.it/xsgmbilk63aa1.png?width=890&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=89e14da5028811b91aaec0954f78362ad94804e8

Finally, lets take a look at the CTB chart from the distance but this time lets look at the shares available \[gray\] and price \[yellow\] marked in the blue box.

https://preview.redd.it/ns2yyclu83aa1.png?width=1257&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63aa5a0268224ad2056247eee4cda29aded0ec94

Massive amount of shares were put to market, consistently at high levels around this time. Price came down as well with seemingly all those shares going ""bye bye"". After those shares went ""bye bye"" utilization seemed to freeze at 100% for Ortex. Well to me that seems like all those shares were borrowed and held. Since they were only paying a 1% fee back then and borrow rates are annual... they would have to pay a higher borrow rate one year later. Well when is the 1 year later mark?

Now the spike in borrow fee makes sense. To me it seems the lenders lured in the borrowers with the low rate and now know that the demand is so high they can jack the prices up and they will continue to borrow.

Having said all this, what will happen?

Are the borrowers continuing to borrow because they are certain the stock price will continue to go down and the borrow rates are well worth it or are they trapped in a losing position by the lenders? Not here to speculate one way or another but the spike in borrow fee recently makes shares as the time to renew a spike in share availability seems to loom.",AMC Lenders are messing with borrowers,1672865278

628,wallstreetbets,"To be clear, I am not making any criminal allegations YET, it's just come to my attention that the firm might be outright lying about the sort of growth they expect in the stocks they hold in order to pump up valuations artificially.

Cathy Wood **hired** mostly **young** finance professionals, most of which have no direct experience in asset management and some of which have held no other full time job outside ARK Invest. For a time I ascribed many of ARK's faults to inexperience, but note that due to the low bargaining power of most her employees the lion's share of ARK's fat 0.75% expense ratio will being going to her. I cannot stress enough, that most if not all of Cathy's employees are **young enough to be her children**, and I have no idea if she's just an old lady trying to be hip or if she's doing all she can to increase her share of the profits. Their website even has a merch store so maybe a little of both...

Profit margins are definitely a motive for some of ARK's actions. ARKX (Space ETF) has in its top 10 holdings PRNT (3d Printing ETF). There's nothing wrong with that as one of the widely anticipated applications of 3d printing is allowing astronauts to custom make any tools they need while in space. However, by **putting** the **one fund into the other fund** that allows ARK Invest to **double dip in** their **fees.**

They also are insatiable optimists, apparently. At one point Cathy asserted that breakthroughs in **AI technology** would cause **GDP growth** to reach **30% a year.** She also gave performance **targets** for her fund that would make them **by far** the **highest performing** investment **fund** of all time due to all the allegedly paradigm shifting technology stocks it contained, with second place going to a 3x levered fund that closed long ago She has even gone as far to argue the pre-revenue companies they hold represent ""deep value"" investing. Ordinarily, I ascribe nonsense like this to a poor understanding of science because science is rarely profitable. However, while that appears to be a factor, more recently extremes have made me unsure if they really believe the junk that comes out of their mouths.

What convinced me to join Michael Burry in shorting ARK Invest was when Tesla soared and actually met ARK's bizarre target prices, they just raised the target price anticipating faster growth. However, in 2022 with rising interest rates it hasn't made anyone back down over there, and now they're issuing equally **aggressive growth targets** for the physical **Tesla factories**, arguing growth over the next few years will outpace all previous years. This isn't just **insane** autism, this **flatly contradicts** the **facts** on the ground. The previous pace of factory setup was so rushed it caused lawsuits, and Tesla is closing their unprofitable Shanghai factory and slashing prices to compete with other EV companies and has no known plans to build more factories at the moment. The only thing going for them is that other less skilled EV companies are going under in the credit crunch and Mr. Musk told his employees to ignore the market and keep making cars. But in any case, for some time now I and many others have believed most if not all of ARK's investments are bubbles, and we were all at least partially right.

Inexperience certainly is a factor because they **threw John Deere** stock **in** the **Space ETF**, with their research officer thinking they were mighty clever finding value in that John Deere does a lot of work with precision GPS mapping for their tractors. While John Deere is a solid stock in its own right (they supply the most essential equipment to the most essential industry), the idea they'd profit any more than marginally from space exploration is silly.

Also, they invested heavily in everything connected to decentralized finance, and we all know by now that's a [decentralized Ponzi scheme.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zm8q76/decentralized_money_is_unlikely_to_survive_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  However, I have no idea whether ARK Invest knew this at the time or if they were duped like many were for a time.

But perhaps the most **suspicious** thing ARK Invest does is their **Adjusted Earnings Reports**. There are strict GAAP rules (Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures) about what companies can and cannot report as earnings. Sometimes GAAP compliant books make a company look worse off that it is, so companies also publish adjusted earnings reports to show what they're thinking. Other times, it's just the execs trying to pump their own stock.

ARK Invest is almost exclusively in pre-revenue companies since you want to grab the moonshots as early as possible. Near all of them are cash incinerators with leverage hidden via private equity investors, and ARK Invest presents their case with adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation Amortization). However, ARK's adjusted earnings would be considered extremely brazen accounting **fraud if** it were remotely **subject to GAAP rules**.

&amp;#x200B;

1. All **R&amp;D costs are adjusted down** to the      average of the NASDAQ 100. The average NASDAQ company spends 12% of their      revenue on R&amp;D while ARK's portfolio spends an average of 27%. The      idea is this R&amp;D is an investment, not a cost.
2. **Identical treatment**      for **sales/marketing** as this is too is an investment, not an      expense... Somehow.
3. **Identical treatment**      for **employee stock** and options. ARK's companies pay an      average of 23% of their employee compensation in stock, many times the      norm. Again, they say this is an investment, not a cost.
4. **Ignore** all      **non-cash costs**. This includes equipment/buildings breaking down      over time, which by GAAP rules is allowed to show up as a monthly cost as      a portion of the total cost of the asset.
5. **Recognize deferred revenue**. This is when a customer pays in advance for something      they receive in the future. I.E. By GAAP rules if you buy a plane ticket      now it's not allowed to be counted as revenue until you use the ticket.      ARK's companies are often loaded with preorders for products that are not      fully invented yet, so this is a bigger deal than it looks.

There's probably more, but I'm not an accountant. However, **by ARK's metrics**, all the **cash incinerators** they own are either **breaking even** or **are wildly profitable**. You can imagine the type of racket there can be cooking the books for companies on your own initiative and getting paid a fee to do so. However, it is not clear if this is the motive, as we may still be dealing with young and stupid investors who don't know a thing about accounting.

But... ARK owns **10% or greater** position in **17** different **small cap** companies and has large stakes in **dozens** of **OTC stocks** and never backed down from these illiquid investments even when they had record inflows. They can definitely be a **whale** with interest in their own fund driving up the price of the underlying assets. Also, the average investor is chasing fund returns, meaning the bigger year over year returns equals more fund inflows and more fees generated. ARK's **worst performing year** actually **generated** the **most revenue** for the company as that is when AUM (Assets Under Management) reached their highs.

Needless to say, ARK's portfolio's **behave suspiciously similar** to a **leveraged S&amp;P** fund both in long-term performance and daily volatility. They were likewise demolished by rising interest rates as equity investments behave like leverage even if they're not counted as liabilities. Personally, I pray the Fed keeps interest rates where they are so that we have no more of these fools and frauds we've seen in recent years. Which one is ARK? Well, as Napoleon said: ""Do not ascribe to malice what can be adequately explained by incompetence.""

I am still relatively-new to the game, and I use Robinhood as my risky playground.  However, since November 2021, I've been on unalive watch.

To try to not be so regarded, I decided I should build a portfolio of blue-chip stocks that consistently payout good dividends.

After looking at options, I found [Forbes's article ""Best Monthly Dividend Stocks For Your 2023 Portfolio.""](https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2022/12/30/best-monthly-dividend-stocks-for-your-2023-portfolio/?sh=751c2838264a)

They include some background information and vocabulary at first, but you all know that, so just scroll down to the stocks.

Or, better yet, scroll down this post to my tracker/calculator.

As a teacher (who is quitting in 9 days!!!!), I don't have the big bucks to YOLO like some of you.  So, I made a little calculator on Google Sheets.

The article provides the company, ticker, annual dividend in dollars per share, and yield.  I took all that information, used some spreadsheet formulas, and made a simple little calculator so I can see how much I can afford and how much I can expect in dividend income. The spreadsheet is linked below. It will prompt you to make a copy if you want to use it.

The ""Current Cost"" column updates every \~20 minutes. There should be a disclaimer from Google at the bottom of the browser.

720,wallstreetbets,"Hi everyone i'm a guy from Italy, today i would like to talk about a company who's making a huge comeback in those years: NIKOLA CORP.

As you probably guys know about this company, especially regarding the stock market, i would like to talk a little bit... hopefully you are gonna take me with a serious manner.

Nikola is making trucks, electric and also Hydrogen (on going, but should be out in the market h2 2023). But why this is so important: well, as European Nikola is backed from IVECO which is one of the biggest company in the trucking industries. So having a strong partner that help this start-up to emerge in the mkt is a fantastic opportunities in the US, but especially in Europe.

The focus of this company is hydrogen, also electric but with less effort, because this particular molecule is going to be revolutionary in this sector... why?

\- The trucks are going to use less battery to make power = less weight and more cargo;

\- Dispatching a huge electric battery is going to be expensive and also bad for the environment;

\-Hydrogen can haul cargo for more miles (at least we're talking from 500 miles and beyond). Of course this numbers are Nikola trucks;

\- Huge collaboration with US and EU hydrogen facilities: they recently sign a partnership with plug power in the US, as well as TA and TC energy. But in Europe they sign a partnership with E.ON energy, one of the biggest hydrogen and renewable energy in Germany and Europe, but why is it so important? with these collaborations, it should be enough to lower the total cost of the truck compared to a diesel in terms of fuel, maintenance and price to acquire. Another important thing, about the US, 240k + 40k incentives from California (probably other state such as NY soon) to purchase one or as a fleet, the second (40k) is from the IRA available from 2023.

\-They are also going to produce their own hydrogen stations and hub to meet the demand by themself, so create a network useful for every kind of miles that a trucker has to do. Doing this should also lower the price of hydrogen to be more competitive with diesel and gasoline.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many thing to write, but in my opinion this is a one in a lifetime opportunity to invest in... if you are young, just like me, i could give you a nice payback in 5 years, they need one thing tho: raise capital. in Order to have as many money to invest and make everything in the right way, nikola must have a stock price higher than now (at least 15-20 or above). Short float is around 30-35% which is pretty high for a company (not as high as GME of course)... so why not a short squeeze? payback should be huge, especially with options because of their low price.

I'm sorry for my English, i try to write in a possible better way, and thank you for the attention you guys can give to this article.. if not no worries, i still love you all.

Happy new year to all.","NIKOLA, the future of trucking... a revolution among this sector",1672848747

737,wallstreetbets," So, if you don't know, a new president has been elected in Brazil, who is a socialist based president and plans to take $PBR, or Petrobas, into an age of government control over parts of the Brazilian economy. The stock plummeted by over 10% when this news came out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lula's policy is a worker's policy. So, from what I know, Petrobas is going to lose a lot of value in the coming years until they can regain control over their company, which requires a different president or for the current one to change policy, which wont' happen. I'm concerned about other investments having similar issues, like Vale mining.

My average cost is close to 18 per share for Vale. It's starting to drop, which is fine in normal conditions, but this might be a bad sign, or a good sign to buy more when the stock goes down enough. Like around $12 or $10. I'm just wondering what more educated people on here would do based on past experiences. Is this the kind of political situation where it's not going to affect all Brazil's stocks, only the ones where the president takes over the company's prices/operations, or will this be a new turn in their economy and I should get the hell out?

Since 2021, an extraordinary number of Americans have been quitting their jobs ‚Äî some flexing their power in a white-hot labor market, others re-evaluating their priorities amid a destabilizing pandemic.  
  
One after another, employees at the New Hampshire manufacturer W.H. Bagshaw said goodbye.  
One went to a robotics company in nearby Boston. Another became an electrician‚Äôs apprentice. In all, 22 workers have left W.H. Bagshaw in the past two years ‚Äî no small matter for a company that has a work force of fewer than 50. That level of departures was also far from normal: In 2019, the company lost just one or two employees; the turnover rate in 2022 was over 30 percent.  
W.H. Bagshaw, which makes precision machined parts for the aerospace and medical industries, was mostly able to replace the workers who left ‚Äî but at a cost. Hiring employees and bringing them up to speed could include teaching them how to operate complex, multi-axis turning machines.

**TL;DR** \- Large drop in insider trading this week, with most buy action stemming from block stakeholders (10%+ ownership). An already low participation count from companies and insiders dropped further this week, which I expect is partly driven by holidays.

Below are notable buys from block stakeholders:

* Q-Grv Vii Investment Partners increased their position in Chargepoint Holdings, inc ($CHPT / Industrials) by $11.9M on Dec. 27th (+6.16%)
* Broadwood Partners purchased an additional \~$9M in Staar Surgical Co ($STAA / Health Care) on Dec. 27th, increasing their stake by 2.22%
* Hill Path Capital Partners purchased an additional $7.5M in Dave &amp; Busters ($PLAY / Consumer Discretionary) on Dec. 28th

In addition, here are a few notable buys from other insiders:

* **Roxanne Austin**, a Director at Crowdstrike Holdings ($CRWD / Information Technology), increased their position by 61.85% with a $2.49MM purchase on Dec. 27th
* **Thomson Leighton**, the CEO of Akami Technologies ($AKAM / Information Technology), increased their position by 27.94% with a $75K purchase on Dec. 28th. Thomson also bought $25K in shares on Dec. 27th

And some notable sales from insiders:

* **Denise Johnson**, the Group President of Caterpillar Inc ($CAT / Industrials), unloaded 73.39% of her stake with a $5.7M sale on Dec. 27th. Johnson now owns 8,605 shares.
* **Andres Gluski**, the President and CEO of Aes Corp ($AES / Utilities) sold 36.8% of his position for $21.3M on Dec. 28th
* **Jay Snowden**, the President and CEO of Penn Entertainment ($PENN / Consumer Discretionary) decreased his stake by 21.29% with a $4.9M sale on Dec. 27th
* **Alesia Haas**, the CFO of Coinbase ($COIN / Financials) sold 32.69% of their position with a $3.18M sale on Dec. 27th

It is understandably less clear why an insider decreases their position size. However, using Coinbase as an example, if the company CFO is unloading nearly a third of their shares‚Ä¶ I would consider that a red flag.

By monitoring insider trading, you will become more informed about the incentives of company executives and consequently make more educated decisions when it comes to your personal investment decisions. 

There is no question that alternative data traditionally has a high price point. That was a key motivation for me to produce these reports and start Form Fore - to level the playing field. I find alternative data to be flat-out interesting and want to put a spotlight on the suits.

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases decreased from $974M to $35.6M (-96%)
* Sales decreased from $869M to $186.8M (-79%)
* Transactions decreased from 391 to 201 (-49%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s decreased from 214 to 128 (-40%)
   * Net buyers decreased from 27 to 22 (-19%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 187 to 106 (-43%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s decreased from 332 to 174 (-48%)
   * Net buyers increased from 30 to 36 (+20%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 302 to 138 (-54%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **December 26th - December 30th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of ‚ÄúP‚Äù or ‚ÄúS‚Äù. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **December 19th - December 23rd.**
4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

811,wallstreetbets,"*With over 150,000 people dismissed in 2022 alone, Dr. Techy has to warn that staff reduction still haunts Silicon Valley and is not gonna help out.*

Silicon Valley are haunted with more announcements of job cuts on the way.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6p4uv60qw0aa1.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f877cffd47cd46884389348df7c36ab7c60f7ef

Tech companies have been laying workers off by the thousands over 12 months, faster than at any time during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is estimated that in 2022 alone, over 150,000 people are dismissed from their job at some of the biggest players in tech ‚Äì Meta, Amazon, Netflix, and Google ‚Äì and smaller firms and startups as well. 

Despite layoffs drastically slowing in 2021, position cuts in tech firms rebound rapidly in 2022 amid interest rate hikes and a slowing economy. Since COVID-19, a total of 249,151 employees have been fired by 1,539 tech firms, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website tracking layoff events from media reports and company releases. Roughly 1,000 technology-driven companies across industries cut 153,160 jobs through the last troubled year, the online tracker counted. Companies are estimated to reduce 80,000 staff in March-December 2020 and 15,000 in all of 2021.

The 2022 figure includes job slashings by Facebook parent Meta Platforms, which announced more than 11,000 layoffs in November alone, as well as some 10,000 potential job cuts by Amazon. Consumer and retail-based companies in the tech sector were some of the hardest hit.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q9i82hxqw0aa1.png?width=397&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21de4085cca7e0c7743f5cfc27646d373c8c12d7

The online tracker counted that nearly 100 healthcare-related tech firms dismissed an estimated 11,000 employees last year. Besides, although education tech companies grew rapidly during the school shutdown in 2022, operators in the same sector cut more than 8,000 jobs.

For travel-related tech industries, massive layoffs followed the lockdowns and travel restrictions in 2020. However, as the world reopened and tourism revived in 2022, travel companies were among the sectors the least impacted by layoffs.

As recession fears grow, cutting costs, especially layoffs, comes the first choice for companies. But does it work, or how much does workplace reduction help firms out?

Layoffs don‚Äôt work to improve company performance, Dr. Techy believes. ¬†Workplace reductions don‚Äôt do much for paring costs, which studies have shown that time after time. Severance packages cost money, layoffs increase unemployment insurance rates, and cuts reduce workplace morale and productivity as remaining employees are left wondering. And overfiring even causes embarrassing rehiring.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rt3lf5fsw0aa1.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c20435695d4e826c06239f1f29d68a35fc4840b1

The social media giant Twitter after laying off roughly half the company in Nov. following Elon Musk‚Äôs $44 billion acquisition, was reaching out to dozens of employees who lost their jobs and asking them to return just in days.

What‚Äôs noteworthy, layoffs often do not increase stock prices, in part because layoffs can signal that a company is having difficulty. Job cuts do not solve what is often the underlying problem, which is often an ineffective strategy, a loss of market share, or too little revenue. Layoffs are basically a bad decision.

*Layoffs are contagious within the tech industry. As fears grow at an exponential rate, it is going to spread across industries and within industries, Dr. Techy thinks.*","Dr. Techy| Silicon Valley saw 150K layoffs last year, a wayout helped little",1672836720

On Jan 3rd, the three major indexes all closed lower. At the close, the Dow dropped 0.03%, the Nasdaq dropped 0.76%, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.4%.

.

The 10-year US Treasury yield dropped 3.377% to 3.748%, compared with a yield spread of -63 bps over the two-year note while VIX was up 5.68%. Brent crude closed down 4.23%. Spot gold closed up 0.73% at $1,839.46 an ounce. The dollar index was up 0.88%, closing at 104.66.

.

The final value of the US Markit Manufacturing PMI in December was 46.2, the lowest since May 2020. According to institutions, the decline in demand for inputs and the increase in the supply of raw materials from suppliers have led to further easing of inflationary pressures. In fact, input price inflation is below trend. The rate of increase in sales prices has also slowed, although it is still rising sharply. The slowing rise in inflation points to the impact of Fed policy on prices, but rising uncertainty and slumping demand suggest that the challenges facing manufacturers will extend into the new year.

One company that is in the game and has yet to be bought out is Aemetis. A biofuels company focused on low, no, and negative carbon intensity biofuels from dairy and orchard agricultural waste products, carbon capture, and biodiesel.  
*What They Do:*  
**Renewable Natural Gas**

* Capture and upgrade methane from dairy cows to create renewable natural gas.

**Sustainable Aviation and Renewable Diesel**

* Transform agricultural waste into fuel for fleets and planes. 
* Finalized a $7 billion supply contract for 100% of Riverbank plant production of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel for up to 10 years. 

Notable contracts with:

* Delta 
* Jet Blue Airlines
* American Airlines
* Alaska Airlines
* British Airways
* Finnair
* Iberia
* Japan Airlines
* Qantas

**Low Carbon Ethanol**

* Produce low-carbon intensity fuel from both corn and wood waste.

**Carbon Capture and Sequestration**

* Build systems to reduce carbon in the atmosphere.

*Their operations/ contracts are estimated to increase Aemetis' revenue and profitability significantly.*   
**From**

* 2021 Revenue $211.9M
* 2021 EBITDA $6.4M

**To**

* 2026 Revenue $1.5B
* 2026 EBITDA $461M

*Risks*  
**History of losses**

* Currently not profitable and has incurred significant losses historically.  
* If unsuccessful in securing additional financing, operations and revenues could decrease or be eliminated.

**Debt level and interest expense could limit cash flows**

* Must sell assets to pay off the loan balance if it cannot be refinanced.

**Dependent on suppliers and customers**

* Purchases all of its corn supplies from a single supplier. 
* Sells all of its Ethanol to 3 entities. 
* If these entities cannot supply the necessary inputs or purchase all products, the company's results from operations would be significantly impacted. 

**Changes in government policies**

* The ethanol industry is reliant upon government policies for increased demand.

As a company with only a **$138M market cap**, Aemetis looks to have a bright future if additional funding (non-diluted) is secured to pay off debt and fund operations.

\*This is about wealth accumulation, not preservation\*

You are a young adult and want to invest your money, but there are endless ways to invest your money, pokemon cards, options, forex, gold, bonds, individual stocks, index funds, hedge funds, silver, cash, international equities, savings accounts, crypto, dividend investing, oil, real estate, private equity, and so much more, where do you even start?!??

To start, why invest in the first place? Inflation. It eats away at everything, including investments, but your cash is sitting at a guaranteed loss, so you have to invest if you want to accumulate/preserve wealth in addition to any external income ex job.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are 3 rules of thumb when Investing:

1. Simplicity is on your side
2. Time is on your side
3. Diversification is on your side

Investing against any of these and the odds are **Against You** (*never impossible)*

&amp;#x200B;

Step 1) Invest 100% of your investible money into an S&amp;P500 index fund ""the golden standard"" of US investing. (constantly chasing diversification will come at the cost of the other rules. If you truly don't want to invest in the S&amp;P 500, the 3-fund strategy is the next best thing)

Step 2) Chase optimization, you should research dividend reinvesting, different brokerages, ETF or MF, Fractional Shares, tax-efficient accounts, LSI or DCA, Tax Efficiency, and Lowest ERs possible for your S&amp;P500 Fund (constantly chasing optimization eventually becomes pointless similarly to diversification)

Note: If you have boatloads of money (1M+ Invested), you are transitioning from wealth accumulation to preservation (a completely different Risk/Reward ratio) where diversification and optimization start to triumph over simplicity.

Step 3) Sit down, hold on, and don't panic. Let compounding interest do its thing over time and you will outperform &gt;95% of all investors, including people that do this for a living that have access to limitless $$$.

937,wallstreetbets,"**Hello, I hope you are having a wonderful start to 2023...**

This is some advice for new/smaller traders. The most important thing you can do right now is to learn who is full of shit and who isn't. I just landed a seasonal position at a prop desk as an intern. You don't have to take my word for it. But seriously, *do not listen to most of what you find on this sub...* 

This place, and the internet in general, is full of plain fools that don't study or do any meaningful work at all in finance. Many of our brethren here at WSB are simply too naive. Seeing any trade at all gets them drooling for risk and they immediately copy a horrible position, inevitably losing a little (if you are lucky) or a whole bunch of money.

Every once in a while, a gem comes up out of the muck of memes and ass-hattery that we all know and love. Do yourself a favor and peruse basic economic theory written by proven experts. *Murphy and Sowell and Schwager are good places to start.* Get the right ideas into your head before a highly regarded post skews your perspectives. It will save you much time indeed.

**Here are some basic tricks that I've learned through live trading:**

*On average, only one out of three trades are successful.*

If you are expecting to win more than every other trade, you are definitely overconfident. It is completely normal for beginners to only succeed every three tries. Many traders think that finance is like a coin toss. It definitely isn't.

*The market can be outperformed.*

If you are smart about risk and volatility and utility and whatnot, you will eventually learn how to beat the annual returns on the S&amp;P, NASDAQ, and DOW. Do not listen to investment articles about being risk-averse and avoiding volatility. If you are in your twenties, you need to be looking for volatility and leverage. The traders at my desk are monstrous in terms of ROI. We're talking doubles, triples, quads, and so on. 

*For the love of God, please take notes.*

Stop throwing money at trades like a cracked-out baboon. Get yourself a cheap ass notebook and a pen and write down at least three words about a trade before you decide to take it. Even if it is something stupid like, ""Thought it was good."" or ""Chart looked promising."" This will propel you far ahead of more than half of the entire trading population. It will help you think about why you took a trade and eventually allow you to learn more about how trades actually work technically and fundamentally.

*Listen to your nerves.*

Trading isn't just a mental thing. It's how you choose to live your life. At a high-level, good trading is knowing what to do and when to do it based on knowledge and experience. There are no easy ways to go about it. You will most likely feel anger, anxiety, shame, denial, and so on. Treat your notional capital like points in a video game. It isn't real anymore. It doesn't matter if it goes up or down. What matters is how you trade and why you do it. It will keep you rational and logical. If you are in a losing streak and want to make back what you lost, take a break. There is nothing worse than overtrading and blowing up an account.

**What should I be trading in 2023?**

Buying shares is a crock of shit if you have less than $25K. Get approved for cash options trading and start experimenting with calls and puts. Pay attention to the SPY and QQQ. Learn about fundamental events and how they affect markets. Central bank policy is a big one that many people track. They basically control the long-term direction of the stock market. It involves how cheap it is to borrow money from banks, which affects the total money supply of the global economy. Right now, things aren't looking so good for speculative assets. Finding overvalued sectors to buy puts in is a good idea. Buying gold is a good idea. If you want to make money this year, it's either finding a safe haven for cash or betting on the market bleeding for most of the year.

* SPY closed down 0.42%
* QQQ closed up 0.68%
* Dow Jones Industrial closed down 0.03%
* VIX closed up 5.86%

Good evening everyone, today the markets opened with a bang and went out with a whimper. The major indices all gapped up but quickly pulled back and broke the previous days lows. However, some ground was recovered as we were able to close near the middle of todays price range.

https://preview.redd.it/9yn1h6uuuw9a1.png?width=2275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d39579052328f0a23e5c33aaaea39b6cc6f8895

For the past two weeks SPY has been range bound between $388 and $374. There is major overhead resistance in the form of selling pressure and moving averages. SPY is not in a strong position at the moment and will need to make very decisive moves for that opinion to change. Tomorrow there are two news announcements that may move SPY out of this range. At 10 am we have the ISM Manufacturing Index but more importantly at 2 am we have the FOMC Minutes release. The FOMC Minutes may give investors a better glimpse into how the Fed thinking of managing interest rates. This news may cause the market to move rapidly in either direction. Be careful if you are holding positions into this announcements or if you plan to open a position soon after.

**Watchlist:**

Many of the watchlist stocks discussed [yesterday](https://everydaytrades.com/market-outlook-01-02-2023/) pulled back from their entry positions today. However, there are always other stocks available to look at.

https://preview.redd.it/4sgvplfvuw9a1.png?width=2260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80dc945d5c2677cf68c4a69c44545b64c2d466fd

CPR (Catalyst Pharmaceuticals) is still in a somewhat decent position. There was an increase in selling volume today but it was not strong enough to break recent lows and price is still above the 21 day EMA. We would need both a steady market and a strong rebound in priced with volume to enter this stock at approximately $19.10. For all stocks regardless of industry or price action it is best to exercise caution especially in the current market environment.

MMP (Magellan Midstream Partners) is in the oil and gas industry and performed relatively well today compare to some of its peers. A break of downward sloping trendline could serve as a buy signal along with heavy volume. Sales and EPS of this company are up 14.49% and 46.96% year over year respectively. There is also 9.4 day of short interest! This means if the shorts are forced to cover it would take them 9.4 days, that is alot of buying volume. The share price is currently around 8% off of recent highs, if the market picks up and the stock price gets close to the recent high some of these short may be forced to cover.

TBBK (The Bancorp) is a financial holding company that had good price action and volume today. It is nearing a base breakout and has a trigger price of $29.60. Additionally, there is 5.2 days of short interest and this stock is sitting at 10% below all time highs.

**Bringing everything together:**

This is not what a healthy market looks are acts like. There are still several steps that need to be taken before the markets start to trend upwards again. Hopefully, the Fed minutes will show the light at the end of the tunnel, but you cannot depend solely on that. What we need to do know is manage are risk and positions carefully. Just because the main indices are not well does not mean that there are no opportunities. We need to cherry pick the best stocks and manage them according. Overall, take profits quickly and do not be afraid to cut losers short.

Looking at the daily chart here on SPY you can see despite the beautiful diamond pattern we had on SPY, Futes and the VIX and spy/ futes breaking out of that diamond we actually ended up with a hard rejection and a red day. 

One interesting note today is that on 12/22 we had that phantom daily range with the upside being at 386.21‚Ä¶ that level was unfilled and untouched up until today. That was an interesting level to see a rejection at. 

With the diamond pattern broken we should have expected upside‚Ä¶ however, we actually ended up getting a support retest at 378 AND at the red support line. This now makes this 378 level and the red support line even stronger than it was before. 

From here like I mentioned last week I am bullish until we see 378 closed below and we hold below that level for more than one day. This upside push this morning did retest and reject the daily 20ema which is going to be a critical level for bulls to retake before we can see a retest of 390.1 resistance. 

Key support- 380.8 -&gt; 379.6 -&gt; 378

Key resistance- 384.4 -&gt; 386.3

&amp;#x200B;

Small morning data dump with job openings and quits‚Ä¶ we also have FOMC minutes at 2pm. Historically looking at past FOMC minute days they actually tend to be a bit of a pivot in markets. This is now our 11th day of consolidation in this area‚Ä¶ we really should start looking for a breakout one way or another. If FOMC minutes is not the catalyst‚Ä¶ then CPI next Thursday will be that catalyst. 

We have some forecast numbers out on CPI but still waiting on official consensus numbers. Will be very interesting to see where those numbers come in‚Ä¶ the preliminary numbers I am seeing are giving a slightly bearish (miss) vibe. The MoM CPI and CORE MoM numbers are not looking very favorable. CORE YoY is looking to go either way‚Ä¶ however, some numbers are showing a possible rebound on CPI YoY while others show a continued unwind and an ever more bullish print in the low to mid 6s‚Ä¶ still need to wait till early next week for that play to see where we end up at. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Futures daily chart shows the pattern the best in my opinion‚Ä¶ it shows that this 3840 to 3845 area is a very key support area. Not only that we came down and held support at 3815 today. Now taking a look at the upside we did have a huge open last night that came up and rejected 3905/3910 resistance area and end up with a rejection at the daily 20ema too. We have some really nice levels here that we are going to keep an eye on throughout the rest of the week. 

Bulls are going to look to hold this as support of that red support line and will look to retrace 3873 tomorrow. If they can do that with a favorable reading of the FOMC minutes we will look at a push to 3920 by EOW. 

Support- 3840 -&gt; 3805 

Resistance- 3873 -&gt; 3895 -&gt; 3920

Poor Tesla getting absolutely punished today. Hitting nearly -15% at one point. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ee80op8sfw9a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d128de9ba029c815bf28abdf1e621d4c6f63b819

For those of you who missed It‚Ä¶. So from what I am seeing Tesla actually hit about 40% vs the 50% they anticipated. A small miss in my opinion‚Ä¶ but play it as it lies. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tx0u0apsfw9a1.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fdff0b9a7a011f0425806d0bf443190f5fa2a28a

Taking a look at our cycles now we have officially reached the peak and started our next cycle down. No telling how low that cycle will take us though. But from high to low we are sitting at nearly -16.6%... we have on average about another 8% to fall over 7 days which puts tesla near $94.3 by 1-12. 

IF you guys remember that 94.4 level is a major support from 2020 so that would definitely put us at a major level if we did get a continued sell off the rest of this week. I was looking at a consolidation week on Tesla but it appears we are actually starting the next leg down‚Ä¶ if trend holds correctly we could see 3 more weeks of downside before we get a bounce. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zb34u34tfw9a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb1baae500d2b4dbda397ca893fcc7623de3dff0

Really nice red falling wedge formed here on Tesla daily along with a blue bear channel too‚Ä¶ If you note that thicker dark red line at the bottom that is the overall 2022/23 bear channel support line I have for tesla (refer back to previous TA for a zoomed out view of this). 

Support- 101.3 (dark red support) 

Resistance- 113 -&gt; 118.7

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c2jfafuvfw9a1.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d47e2c4bd292047cae73ad8af157b5a392f482b6

Perhaps the most intriguing part of today was that the VIX actually opened up very green about 6%+ and SPY had opened green. A very intriguing anomaly that does not usually happen. IT was a good clue that one was about to give. 

Mid day the VIX actually looked convincingly bearish (as in we were going to see downside for the markets). We had a nice push to that key 23.6 level and sat there for quite a long time. However, with this rejection here at 23.6 and this possible evening start doji forming here we should expect the VIX to retrace back to the 22 area tomorrow which should give markets a boost. 

One note with FOMC minutes tomorrow is that we could see a small uptick in the VIX leading into FOMC minutes at 2pm. However, the VIX should unwind by EOD. 

**Daily log-**

I played the odds on a green open post quarterly options expiration and the reaped the rewards of that. The three day weekend unfortunately cause those calls to not be as great of a win as they should have been. But the play was there. I am actually am highly dissatisfied with the play as when I bought my calls IV was about 12 and at open we saw IV near 40-50 on calls and near 60-70 on puts‚Ä¶ we should have seen a pretty massive pump on premiums and with a large 0.5% green open OTM calls should have seen a much large gain at open then they did. But unlike the 3 day weekend for xmas we actually saw premiums take a huge hit with that 3 day weekend. 

Intraday today finally felt like the technical were back to normal. A few times we had premiums moving a little oddly on 0dte but for the most part playing level to level today with the help of technical was spot on and very rewarding.

This god damn African has lost me so much money I don't even know how to cope beyond seething uncontrollably.

This mother fucker overpaid for Twitter by about 37 billion dollars, had to sell half of his tesla shares to avoid bankruptcy, and now tweets like 40 times a day.

Elon has like 100 million followers, so you know that he isn't just blasting random shit out in 10 seconds, like some random thought. 

Let's be super generous and say that Elon thinks about his tweets for about 15 minutes before sending (in likelihood it's much longer than that). 40 tweets a day, x 15 minutes, is 600 minutes. 

That's 10 hours. **10 hours is how long Elon thinks about tweeting, every single day**. This fucking African is getting zero work done, there is no head of Tesla anymore, just some ASS trying to save Twitter, which literally no one gives a shit about anymore. Myspace died, Facebook died, and Twitter will die next.

And now, some Chinese guy just got promoted to number 2 at Tesla, which means he's number 1 because Elon can't stop tweeting stupid shit to the hodge twins.

1. There has been sustained bias towards PUTS which connotes a bearish feeling (image 1)
2. In case of a bullish reversal, there are two major resistance levels at strikes $385 and $390 (image 2)
3. Support levels for SPY are sparse, one is at $375 and an absolute mammoth support line at $355 (image 3)
4. Strike $385 is currently delta hedged by 850K units of SPY stock or equivalents while strike $390 is hedged by 475K. If the price of SPY doesn't reach this levels, these CALLs will be closed and the hedges sold which will depress the price of SPY even further. (image 4)
5. There are $3B of currently not delta hedged calls up to strike $390, in the case of a sudden bullish reversal, MMs can some of this gun powder to short the stock to temporarily depress the price below $385 or $390 and render the contracts worthless at expiration. (image 5) 
6. Selling strikes &gt; $390  seems safe enough

1321,wallstreetbets,"*Folks, on the very last trading day of 2022, it‚Äôs time to review the events of 2022 with Dr. Techy.*

Take a look back at 2022, it is a dramatic and eventful year that no one has ever had expected. The outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war shocked the World and pains still linger. Over-hot inflation urged central banks to hike rates globally and aggressively. Euro rumbled to parity against soaring US dollar. China finally dropped Covid-19 restrictions. Elon Musk‚Äôs Twitter buyout polished him the most popular internet celebrity‚Ä¶

Here are the most influential events that happened in global markets for 2022 in review.

**Event 1: Russia-Ukraine war outbreak**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vjhi0m80ut9a1.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d808fc7d0490a763c3478784734387dc0543465

On February 24, Russian invaded Ukraine. Russian benchmark index plunged as much as 50% after the war outbreak. The very next day, Russia‚Äôs Central Bank announced that the Moscow Exchange suspended stock trading from Feb. 28. After a nearly month-long break, Russia resumed stock trading, with 33 securities traded on the Moscow Exchange. Stocks rose as short-selling was officially banned. By the way, there are more sufferings ongoing outside the markets.

The EU, US, and their allies committed to removing Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system, as well as imposing measures on the Russian Central Bank and further restrictions on Russian elites. 

*Dr. Techy: Wishes for love &amp; peace in 2023!*

**Event 2: Prices on the rise**

 

https://preview.redd.it/zj641wc1ut9a1.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17abc83047ce04bf040c140773880508aba75a08

2022 saw years-high inflation across the world. U.S. inflation hit a 40-years high in April and continued to climb in the following months. American consumer prices index (CPI) came in at 9.1% at its fastest pace in nearly 13 years amid a burst in used vehicle costs and price increases in food and energy. In addition, Europe also suffered price increases, with CPI reaching record highs for 12 consecutive months. 

Global inflation is forecast to rise from 4.7 percent in 2021 to 8.8 percent in 2022, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in a new report on Oct. 11. 

*Dr. Techy: Inflation sucks, and it also sucks my profits.*

**Event 3: Fed gets aggressive**

 

https://preview.redd.it/hxek0ja2ut9a1.png?width=628&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39ccf41b395b920afbded49baa784b8f9d68454a

Sticky inflation led Fed to increase rates aggressively. The Federal Reserve (Fed) raised rates seven times and by a total of 425 bps since March when it established its hawkish approach to curtailing inflation. It is the most aggressive start to a tightening cycle in the last 40 years. The federal funds rate target is 4.25%-4.50%, which is the highest range since 2007.

In addition, to tame the rising prices, central banks overseeing the 10 most heavily traded currencies delivered 2,700 basis points (bps) of tightening in 54 rate hikes over the past 12 months.

*Dr. Techy: So, how soon will the Fed cut rates?*

**Event 4: Dollars spikes, Euro bitters**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hmgo0m63ut9a1.png?width=590&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed9f03bf5ea006c9551bf7b108e6a731b484704e

The dollar enjoyed one of its strongest years ever, up almost 9% year-to-date, as the Federal Reserve was the first central bank among developed economies to rein on stubbornly high inflation with an aggressive tightening. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the buck against a basket of currencies, rose to 110.01 in September. This is the index‚Äôs best level in more than 20 years, lifting its year-to-date rally to nearly 15%. Over the last 12 months, the DXY has surged about 18%.

The euro hit parity with the U.S. dollar on July 13, meaning the two currencies had a 1:1 exchange rate. That hasn‚Äôt occurred since 2002 when the euro was in its infancy. At the currency‚Äôs low point, ‚Ç¨1 was briefly worth $0.9999 before a slight rebound.

*Dr. Techy: Well, that's good news for Americans traveling to Europe.*

**Event 5: China drops Covid-19 restrictions**

 

https://preview.redd.it/qv7fdow3ut9a1.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c240a6b7502d92e23e18bdeca63303df546ab9e8

China announced to reopen borders and abandon quarantine on December 26, in one of the country‚Äôs most significant steps toward reopening since the coronavirus pandemic began. The decision is the country‚Äôs last step in shedding three years of zero-Covid and pivoting to living with the virus.

*Dr. Techy: Congrats to China.*

**Event 6: Energy backfire: oil &amp; gas**

 

https://preview.redd.it/yizl5ru4ut9a1.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a99af9b45c557399e0a3394e08ad7b6a0402cea2

Crude oil futures spent much of 2022 surging amid Russia‚Äôs invasion and demand returning. Brent crude futures rose above $139 per barrel in March, the highest since 2008. Then, oil prices fluctuated lower after mid June and gave up most of gains for the year, even down below the pre-Ukraine crisis level in November. The turnaround came after the U.S. and OECD countries implemented unprecedented production cuts, and OPEC+ also squeezed production again in October.

Besides roiling oil, Europe went through a gas crisis due to the supply chain. While Dutch TTF gas futures was traded at 89 euros/MWh on Feb. 23, the day before Ukraine war broke out, the prices continued to surge and peaked at nearly 350 euros/Mwh on August, hitting record highs. All of a sudden, however, ¬†Europe has more natural gas than it knows what to do with. The European spot price for gas dipped into negative territory and once down at -15.78 euros/Mwh on Oct. 24, an all-time low.

**Event 7: Ghost of 2008 still haunts U.S. stock market**

Stocks are headed for their worst yearly performance since 2008. The S&amp;P, one of the broadest measures of the health of Corporate America, fell by 19.7% at Tuesday‚Äôs close while the Nasdaq index‚Äôs fallen 33.8% year to date. The Dow index is off by 8.5%. Markets have tanked thanks to four-decade highs in inflation and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs hawkish response. No major asset class‚Äîstocks, bonds, real estate, crypto‚Äîhas gone unscathed.

What‚Äôs worse, equity listings on the Nasdaq fell about 80% this year, as the appetite for new issues took a hit from extreme volatility in the stock market. A total of 156 companies listed their shares on the bourse this year, raising nearly $15 billion in initial public offerings, a far cry from 743 firms that raised $180 billion in what was a blockbuster 2021, data from the exchange operator showed.

*Dr. Techy: Why the ghost of 2008 still haunts us in 2022?*

**Event 8: Crypto collapses: to the moon, down to earth**

""To the moon!"" Much of crypto did graze the stratosphere at the start of 2022 when enthusiasm was astronomically high, but a few months later it all came crashing back down to Earth. Bitcoin's value is roughly a fourth of what it was a year ago, and the industry is just starting to grapple with the fallout from the catastrophic implosion of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX.

In the future, 2022 may be regarded as a turning point for the world of virtual currencies, when they lost their luster and were cast out as a fringe product most people approach with skepticism and caution. Or it may simply be remembered as a stretch of excruciating growing pains for an industry still in its infancy. Regardless, 2022 was one for the crypto history books

*Dr. Techy: In 2022, crypto said ‚ÄúF U‚Äù.*

**Event 9: Big Tech layoffs**

The job cuts in tech land are piling up, as companies that led the 10-year stock bull market adapt to a new reality. The total number of layoffs in U.S. technology companies reached 80,978 in the first 11 months, an increase of 535% year-on-year, and the scale of layoffs hit a new high in 20 years, according to data from Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, a Chicago-based global outplacement &amp; career transitioning firm.

If there was one person driving the news cycle in 2022, it was Elon Musk. He started 2022 as the world‚Äôs richest person and ends it as the second richest person on Earth after his takeover of Twitter Inc.. The multi-billionaire is distracted from his electric-vehicle business, people think. Tesla's stock price has fallen nearly 70% in 2022, with 767.9 billion US dollars evaporated. With 123.7 million followers, Elon Musk‚Äôs account, is already the second most followed, after Barack Obama, the former US president.

Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickersFundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment‚Äôs price.I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.|

|Things to consider when finding the plays-¬∑ If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.¬∑ If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play. (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.)¬∑ The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.|",Moving Tickers of Interest,1672750494

The telecom industry is facing a disproportionate demand and supply due to poor user experience and low accessibility of connectivity for consumers. Thus, those who develop and operate telecom networks don't have enough clients, which can lead to prolonged development of the market and skyrocketing service prices.

But with Weaver Labs, that's no longer the case. Their ecosystem aims to improve accessibility, enhance the user experience with a software-based platform, and unite those who build networks with those who consume them.

They've developed Cell-Stack, a software stack that aggregates all telecoms infrastructure and opens it up to be consumed as a service. It acts as an open marketplace of telecommunications assets, using blockchain technology to create a ""network of networks"" and bridge the gap in the telecoms area.

Cell-Stack offer s two types of followers } to interact with it: the supply side (those who own telecoms infrastructure) and the demand side (those who want to consume services). Blockchain technology is used to solve friction when accessing telecoms infrastructure, serving as a key governance component of the marketplace and coordinating trust among all the different players of the network.

With the rise of cloud networks and the open access model, which is more focused on users than on functionalities, now is the perfect moment to innovate the telecoms sector with cutting-edge Web 3.0. solutions.

Look at their subreddit at [r/Weaver\_Labs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Weaver_Labs/)/ as well as their Medium page at [https://medium.com/weaver-labs](https://medium.com/weaver-labs) to learn more about the project",Weaver Labs is aiming to bridging the gap between Web 3.0. and Telecoms by building something that has never been done before,1672750013

I firmly believe that inflation is already baked in as producers/manufacturers are STILL suffering from relatively high energy and material/commodity prices. Supply chain issues may seem to be solved but it's only better as you can ship your product on time IF you can get everything on your assembly line/plant on time. It's not that they can't meet the demand at full capacity. It's just that most factories cannot run at full capacity. Soon they won't have to, with consumers going broke. Many analysts expect Americans to run out of savings by mid-year. So even if we solve all supply chain issues, there won't be demand to pump more products. 


This will force manufacturers to cut supply and increase prices. Hence inflation... Prices are sticky. They will neither go down nor slow down at a reasonable pace as expected. 


This time it's different. 


Bailouts: They already happened. Covid relief and M2 pump... yea... that's your ""liquidity"" in the markets. Balance sheet is already huge. That's a bailout for finance. JPOW is not rushing to pull money out of the system for a reason. 


In the next year, many businesses will fail and go bankrupt. This doesn't mean that market will crash. Market will only crash if they run out of liquidity. If I'm reading between the lines right at JPOW's speeches, he will keep liquidity high. They will NOT lower interest rates because they can't at a time of high inflation. This scenario can be familiar to those who have lived/worked in developing countries. Real stagflation will be a unfamiliar experience for western central banks because they haven't really seen it in decades. Furthermore, it never hit when finance was this complicated and interconnected worldwide with so much more leverage than there has ever been in the past. The great reset is almost necessary at this point. The gears of economy starts turning with a single dollar spent by a consumer. There is nothing else that can turn the rest of the gears except for ""bail outs"" which is only a temporary relief. 


China, despite all the covid talk, can produce and export a lot more than it imports. This will not change. Even if their housing bubble bursts, they will contain it, like they have been doing so. 


Canada will probably go bankrupt in a year or two. There is no sugar coating it. In a country where people are already house-rich cash-poor, there is no saving it when variable interest loans make up a high portion of consumer debt. Many mom and pop real state investors built variable debt over variable debt with HELOCs. At some point something will have to give. Even if everyone spends every cent to service their debt, main street will die... layoffs... then bankruptcies. As of today foreigners cannot buy real estate legally (unless they use some shell company and a Canadian ""buddy"").


Euro zone is giving the biggest trade deficits in recent years with energy crisis really affecting every.single.entity. A rumour I've recently heard is that some auto manufacturers are able to build most of the car but cannot get windshields on time. So they sit in a lot somewhere waiting for completion. Turns out glass-making requires a lot of energy. 


EU is the contagion that will keep on giving with the war, production, and political issues. One favourable piece of data is that most of Europe is ""socialist"" for you cowboys. They have low consumer debt. They have some slack there. But with the interest rates climbing to 5-6 percent range in the next year, this may change. Europe is still playing a lot of things by the book. For example, they still have their fractional reserve requirements in effect, unlike US of A. 


It will be roller coaster of a year to say the least. Market ""analysts"" will infer nonexistent messages and pump the markets for a few up days. It will be pretty much like last 4-5 months. JPOW and co will ""disappoint"" analysts and ""the markets."" Then we'll have down days. 


Be extra fucking careful if you're playing options. Theta will not show mercy for those of us playing a month or two out. False narratives will move the market ""irrationally."" 


I'm expecting a prolonged slow declining bear market this year in general. But some sectors have already gone through a correction - such as tech stocks. This doesn't mean they will go up and moon this year. They will trade sideways. Those that haven't come down to Earth will have their corrections this year. Companies with high short term debt and negative cash-flows are a big no for me. If you're not making money, I don't think you'll make it in this climate. It's actually a good year for stock buybacks but big corps are full of regards. They like buying high. You don't have to watch for Dow Transportation index anymore. We get near real time data. Most of what's to be said is said and what's to be done is done. Now we wait. 


Traditionally, high inflation-high interest times show greater savings. People would rather save than spend. Thanks to high debt and leverage, this isn't the case anymore. So let THAT sink in. 


Good luck.

**Summarize Book: Poor Charlie's Almanack**

**The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger**

**Peter D. Kaufman, Ed Wexler, Warren E. Buffett, Charles T. Munger**

Poor Charlie's Almanack is a book containing a compilation of the wit and wisdom of Charles T. Munger, a successful businessman and investor who is best known as the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. The book is edited by Peter D. Kaufman, Ed Wexler, and Warren E. Buffett, and it contains a selection of Munger's talks, speeches, and writings, along with commentary and insights from others. The book covers a wide range of topics, including investing, psychology, decision-making, and personal development, and is filled with practical advice and lessons learned from Munger's extensive experience in business and investing. It is highly regarded as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning from one of the most successful and influential thinkers of our time.

**Provide 25 key takeaways with examples from this book**

1. Invert, always invert: To make better decisions, try to think about the opposite of what you're trying to do and consider the consequences. For example, instead of trying to find ways to make a project succeed, consider all the ways it could fail.

2. Multidisciplinary thinking is crucial: The best decisions are made by considering multiple viewpoints and disciplines. For example, a doctor who only thinks about medicine may not consider the financial implications of a treatment, while an accountant who only thinks about finances may not consider the medical consequences.

3. Understand the power of incentives: People's behavior is largely driven by their incentives, so it's important to consider what's motivating someone when trying to understand their actions. For example, a salesperson's commission may be an incentive for them to sell a product that may not be in the best interest of the customer.

4. Don't be swayed by peer pressure: Just because something is popular or widely accepted doesn't mean it's the best choice. For example, just because everyone else is investing in a certain stock doesn't mean it's a good investment for you.

5. Know the difference between pleasure and happiness: Seeking pleasure can often lead to short-term gratification but may not lead to long-term happiness. For example, eating a slice of cake may bring temporary pleasure, but regularly indulging in unhealthy behaviors may not lead to long-term happiness.

6. Don't let cognitive biases influence your decisions: Our brains are prone to certain biases that can distort our perception and judgment. For example, the sunk cost fallacy can cause us to continue investing time and resources into a project because we've already invested so much, even if it's not a good decision.

7. Understand the value of simplicity: Simplicity is often the key to making good decisions. For example, a simple investment strategy may be more effective than a complex one.

8. Be willing to change your mind: It's important to be open to new information and willing to change your mind when presented with evidence that contradicts your beliefs. For example, if new research shows that a previously held belief is incorrect, it's important to be willing to adjust your thinking.

9. Embrace the concept of ""margin of safety"": When making decisions, it's important to consider the potential risks and have a ""margin of safety"" to protect against them. For example, when investing, it's a good idea to only invest in companies with strong financials to provide a margin of safety in case the market takes a downturn.

10. Understand the role of compound interest: Compound interest can have a huge impact on long-term financial success. For example, starting to save for retirement in your 20s versus your 40s can make a significant difference in the amount you'll have saved by retirement age.

11. Know your own limitations: It's important to be aware of your own strengths and weaknesses and not take on tasks that are beyond your abilities. For example, if you're not good at public speaking, it may not be a good idea to take on a job that requires a lot of public speaking.

12. Be willing to take calculated risks: Taking calculated risks can lead to great rewards, but it's important to carefully consider the potential downsides as well. For example, starting a business can be a risky but potentially rewarding venture.

13. Don't let emotions cloud your judgment: It's important to try to keep emotions in check when making important decisions. For example, it's not a good idea to sell a stock simply because you're feeling anxious about the market.

14. Understand the concept of opportunity cost: Every decision has an opportunity cost

15. Don't fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy: It's important to consider the future rather than being swayed by the amount of time, money, or resources already invested in a project.

16. Learn from your mistakes: It's important to reflect on mistakes and failures and learn from them, rather than dwelling on them or making excuses.

17. Don't let your ego get in the way: Ego can cloud judgment and lead to poor decisions. It's important to be aware of the role your ego plays in your decision-making process.

18. Seek out diverse viewpoints: It's important to consider multiple perspectives and not get trapped in your own way of thinking.

19. Understand the role of probability in decision-making: Probability can help guide decision-making, but it's important to be aware of the limitations and uncertainties of probability estimates.

20. Don't over-optimize: It's important to consider the big picture and not get caught up in small details at the expense of the overall goal.

21. Be open to new ideas: It's important to be open to new ideas and not get stuck in a certain way of thinking.

22. Don't let fear hold you back: Fear can prevent people from taking necessary risks or pursuing opportunities. It's important to recognize and confront fear in order to make good decisions.

23. Practice mental discipline: It's important to train the mind to think clearly and rationally, rather than letting emotions or biases cloud judgment.

24. Seek out mentors and role models: It's valuable to seek out mentors and role models who can provide guidance and advice.

25. Continuously learn and grow: It's important to continuously learn and grow in order to make better decisions and improve overall quality of life.

Good evening and happy new year everyone. I hope that you all have had a great start to this year and are excited for all the new opportunities that may present themselves. Last year the markets really took a hit, especially FAANG and other big tech stocks. Interestingly, value stocks such as those that are included in the Dow have fared relatively well with the Dow only closing down around 9% for the year. There is still a considerable amount of uncertainty in the markets as the VIX still remain elevated. However, looking forward there are still several stocks that are setting up for potentially money making moves.

https://preview.redd.it/m9nnpgidxp9a1.png?width=2235&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b362e1a63fb2489aa7b56a0bad0f69785e3c785

APA is an oil and gas company that is currently siting 10% off of its 52 week high. Sales and EPS are both way up year over year and the current price is above all of the moving averages. If we see a good push through $48.60 with an increase in volume this could be a good position to open.

https://preview.redd.it/w6cofo1exp9a1.png?width=2259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1e1c19fdbb91fa3f9ec94f817a15866c2cc8807

CPRX (Catalyst Pharmaceuticals)is a biotechnology company that has been trending upward for the past few months and is currently close to all time highs. During the last trading day price gapped down but recovered to the 8 day [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/) (red line). This would be a pull back setup which is typically riskier than a base breakout or cup and handle. If we see price push above the 8 day [EMA](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/) as well as the wicks from the previous days with heavy volume this could be a good place to open a position. There is also 3.2 days of short interest with could play a factor if the short positions have to cover and thus cause an increase in buying volume.

https://preview.redd.it/l8q6v0oexp9a1.png?width=2266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78b248936299598c17de447595051d99359962ee

CVX (Chevron) is also an oil and gas company that is forming a cup and handle pattern. CVX has had increasing sales and EPS year over year. The top of the handle at $180.30 would be the buy point if you choose to open a position.

https://preview.redd.it/0y4mcm6fxp9a1.png?width=2257&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=613262fcfd82b881bb2acb467d87caf5fe43d6db

SLB (Schlumberger) is forming a bas with a trigger point of $54.20. The sales and EPS are increasing year over year and there is also 1.6 days of short interest. While this is not a significant amount of short interest it is relevant as this stock is approach new multi year highs.

1461,wallstreetbets,"It comes down to this-

I grew up in a slightly upper middle class household. I worked during summers my teenage years, but my parents were able to pay for college. We weren't rich, but my boomer parents will be leaving me about 2MM in assets which is fantastic, but I'm just saying I'm not a Rockefeller or anything... **I do have to work if I want a family**. 

So I went to a pretty good college, got a job afterwards, and after 6 years I was making about 140k in Los Angeles which is nothing, half of that goes to rent and alcohol.

However, between 2017 and 2021, I struck it big with Tesla, ""coins"" (I believe you can't mention that name here"", and basically turned 60k into 1.5MM post tax. It was fucking insane. I quite my job to just live it up.

Again, I grew up in a decent financial environment. We went out to nice restaurants once or twice a month, and took a yearly vacation to some pretty nice places... but after my wins in ""investing"" I was traveling 6 months out of the year and eating $150+ meals whenever I wanted. Literally I would wake up at 3pm and order $150 bucks of amazing sushi and have it delivered to my door. Those were the best times.

I'm fucking poor again though. I invested wisely into a rental property, but I lost like 600k last year on stupid YOLOs and general downturn, and am now kind of broke again. I'm actually like fucking poor, I only get 3k/month from rent and that's all I have besides like 30k in Tesla shares.

The problem is that the **illusion has been shattered for me**. I have caught a glimpse of life outside wageslaving and I literally cannot go back. It's fucking horse shit that some wallstreet bro can click a button and make 400k in 1 week, which would take someone 30 years of burger flipping to save up.

You laugh, but all work is work. Burger flipping isn't an easy job and someone's gotta do it. Even a surgeon needs to save up for like 5 years to save up 400k, whereas MONEY PEOPLE have returns so absurd that normal people would puke if they understood.

And now I understand. You ask how these finance people can behave in such shitty ways, legally stealing money from everyone, not working but making thousands of times more money than the average white collar worker, let alone blue collar. Once you have had a taste of this life, you cannot go back. You can't go back to some asinine cubicle job, pushing paper, taking shit from regarded coworkers, with no outlet for your rage since you're afraid of getting fired, eventually developing cancer from decades of internalizing your anger...

no, once you've seen it, there's no going back. That's why these finance guys are such cutthroat psychopaths... they also don't want to work. No one wants to fucking work, but they found the real path to not working.

And now, after this bullrun, I suspect there are many people like me, who instead of being productive members of society are now just looking for ways to make bank again without working.

ACTUALLY NO!  I only hopped in gold at the end of 2022, because I see commodities (personally gold) and volatility selling strategies as the best performing asset class in 2023 AGAIN.  And because I'm so bullish on gold outperforming other asset classes, that I'm actually hoping to get some counter arguments from the big brained folks here before I max my credit to buy gold.

# Ok!

As you all know, while every asset class like stocks, bonds, etc... even gov treasuries crashed this year (believe it or not, your super duper safe haven super safe US treasury ETF $TLT fell 30% this year - so much for safety amirite), gold and many other commodities maintained it's value and even so in a RISING RATE environment üòÆ.  Although 2023 probably won't be as bad as 2022, I still see gold outperforming other asset classes for mostly the same reason it did in 2022.

**Why did gold outperform in 2022**?

1. Gold showed that once again it's a place where you can **really store value**.  Remember all the hype of Cryptos and all the TikTok stars clamoring cryptos are a store of value and inflation hedge and yada yada??  How's that correlation with the overall stock market work out?  How's boys like SBF and the lack of regulation work out in building investor confidence?  You think institutions will still maintain confidence in it and market it to their clients?  How's hypemen like Tom Brady and Matt Damon do for investor confidence as well?  While I believe in block chain tech, let's be honest, we are probably gonna have a winter for a bit because there isn't stimmies flowing out left and right, and let's be honest, a lot of people - the later bandwagoners, probably lost a bunch of money getting into it thinking it's a store of value and valid currency and not as a speculative asset, so probably have a bad taste in their mouths.  Oh! And mining bitcoin is bad for the environment.  You can't live in the West and be pro bitcoin or you are bad heartless person: [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/eu-will-likely-ban-bitcoin-to-no-avail](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/eu-will-likely-ban-bitcoin-to-no-avail) , just like you can't be pro fossil fuels, pro meat consumption, etc... all bad people stuff.  So it's time to get with the times and be anti-cryptos as well or eventually you are a bad person too.  And you don't want to be a bad person otherwise you end up like Putin.  Cryptos soon won't be ""vogue"" anymore when the next gen of kids get brainwashed because cryptos kill polar bears.  The powers that be are already setting this in motion.  Don't be that boomer in the next gen's eyes...
2. Gold maintained it's value in 2022 not only because it's an inflation hedge, but also of **central bank buying**.  [https://www.ft.com/content/e0983ebb-bbe0-4d33-8517-e19fa06e1a77](https://www.ft.com/content/e0983ebb-bbe0-4d33-8517-e19fa06e1a77). I'll get into more why this is the case and why I think it will continue next.

**Why gold should continue to perform well in 2023**?

Too many reasons!

1. **Continued central bank buying**:  When war in Ukraine broke out, the West froze Russia's USD assets. [https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/russian-bank-foreign-reserve-billions-frozen-sanctions-n1292153](https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/russian-bank-foreign-reserve-billions-frozen-sanctions-n1292153)  Any country, that currently aren't simps for the West (China, Russia, India, Middle East, Turkey, South America, etc...) have immediately taken note of this unprecedented action by the west.  If they want to do ANYTHING that may be considered naughty naughty ü§≠ ü§´by the west, they could get their USD assets frozen.  Hence, the frenzy in all of these countries in trying to diversify their reserves away from USD into something else - which one of the new assets they are buying, besides something like the Yuan, is Gold: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-30/russia-to-raise-yuan-share-in-wealth-fund-to-60-gold-to-40?leadSource=uverify%20wall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-30/russia-to-raise-yuan-share-in-wealth-fund-to-60-gold-to-40?leadSource=uverify%20wall)  I see this trend to continue from now until de-globalization reverses, which could be quite a while.  This should prop up gold and other commodity prices.  The US is losing it's grip/influence in a lot of spaces in the world that's not the EU.  Saudi Arabia as an example.
2. **Reaching the terminal rates** :  Often times when rates rise, gold falls.  Yet, rates have risen by so much in 2022 yet gold has maintained it's price.  With the Fed supposedly reaching the end of the rate hikes and inflation supposedly peaking, this catalyst to decrease gold prices will eventually come off the table. 
3. **Persistent Inflation**: While inflation is coming down, I truly do believe that the Fed will never hit it's target of 2% inflation, without completely destroying demand and causing the country to enter a deep and tough recession.  I don't see the Fed willing to raise rates so much to do that, partly because of political pressure and partly because that just creates even more issues.  As a reuslt, both demand and supply side dynamics will continue to keep inflation above 2%
   1. **Supply Side Inflation Continues**: Everyone keeps on saying supply side inflation is ""transitory"" is the same dummies that said inflation is ""transitory"".  If the west really wanted to reduce supply side inflation, they would stop fueling the war in Ukraine.  They would stop being anti fossil fuel and anti a lot of things.  That's not ending any time soon, so supply side inflation won't stop.  Additionally, given how the west is so afraid of covid, we could once again see supply side inflation if China unleashes their population to infect the world again, leading to supply chain issues.
   2. **Demand Side Inflation Continues**: Given that the Fed probably won't bring us to a deep and serious recesssion with unemployment spiking over 10% and really crushing the demand side of things, demand will never drop low enough for inflatoin to reach 2%. Additionally, the west likes to fight inflation by handing out more money.  While the Fed can stop printing, like it's been doing, goverments themselves can continue to spend with money they don't have.  California is giving out money to fight inflation: [https://www.kcra.com/article/california-inflation-relief-payments-timeframe-update-1672447464/42371519](https://www.kcra.com/article/california-inflation-relief-payments-timeframe-update-1672447464/42371519).  Same with Spain [https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/spain-announces-106-bln-package-ease-inflation-pain-2023-2022-12-27/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/spain-announces-106-bln-package-ease-inflation-pain-2023-2022-12-27/).  Politicians live for votes, so they will never be aligned with the central bank.  Like any good corporation, they care about lining their pockets now, not necessarily do what's best.  Y**ou and I like free money, so we will never say no when a politician promises us free money for votes.  There's no end to it**.
   3. **TLDR**: Western govs like to induce inflation via their policies such as anti fossile fuel, extending the war in Ukraine, locking stuff down, etc... while handing out stimmies for votes.  The central bank must fight against all that but they can only do so much without causing a real legit recession.
   4. Example: Sellers used to sell 100 widgts and buyers bought 100 widgets.  Now only 50 widgets are availalbe due to supply constraints so the price goes up.  Only 50 widgets are now sold and some people can't afford them so they miss out.  Gov hands out stimmies so now more people can afford the 50 available widgest, so it goes up further in price.
4. **Changing Fed Inflation Target**: If the Fed can't get inflation down to 2%, that will unleash another wave of lack of confidence in the USD and fed, causing real assets to go up again.  And the Fed is already laying the groundwork for this when it realizes in 2-3 years that it can't reach it's 2% goal without causing a real and deep recession.  No one wants to go in depth yet on this stark reality, but the Fed stated in it's most recent meeting that: ""**there may be a longer-run project"" that could take a fresh look at the central bank's inflation goal**. "" [https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2022-12-14/powell-says-fed-will-not-change-2-inflation-goal](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2022-12-14/powell-says-fed-will-not-change-2-inflation-goal).  Some managers are already making this claim - the Fed just has not admit it: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/bill-ackman-says-fed-s-2-inflation-target-no-longer-credible?leadSource=uverify%20wall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/bill-ackman-says-fed-s-2-inflation-target-no-longer-credible?leadSource=uverify%20wall).  Wait for the Fed to admit it and see what happens to commodities...
5. **Debt Ceiling Volatility**: 2023 marks a year where we may have another debt ceiling crisis.  While Reps are not as fiscally conservative as they used to be, they are still 1000% more conservative than Dems these days.  If inflation is still a hot topic, they may be able to rally around being more fiscally conservative, causing a deadlock as they control the House.  Some pundits are saying that this debt ceiling crisis could be as volatilie as the one in 2011 and 1995.  In both of those situations, gold prices popped, i personally have it going up 10% in 1995 and 20% in 2011.  While this is a small move in % terms, with the low implied volatility on gold options, it's a pretty big move within a few months. [https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/economy/debt-ceiling-fight-goldman-sachs/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/economy/debt-ceiling-fight-goldman-sachs/index.html)
6. **Petrogold And Russia**: Similar to how central banks are moving away from the USD, if Russia truly gets desperate in the war in Ukraine, they could do the nuclear option and demand gold for oil/gas.  This scneario is more of a pipe dream that gold bulls like to push and is not covered by main stream media, aka it's more on the conspiracy side of things...but it's not impossible if Putin truly becomes desperate.  [https://www.kitco.com/news/2022-12-07/If-Russia-accepts-gold-for-oil-gold-price-doubles-to-3-600-says-Credit-Suisse-s-Zoltan-Pozsar.html](https://www.kitco.com/news/2022-12-07/If-Russia-accepts-gold-for-oil-gold-price-doubles-to-3-600-says-Credit-Suisse-s-Zoltan-Pozsar.html)
7. **Fed Pivot**: I personally don't see a fed pivot occuring next year given that I don't see inflation going down to 2% and I believe the Fed is going to be cautious so we don't hit a an outright recession.  Most people say fed pivot in 2H 2023, I say 2024-2025.  With that said, the financing market is very tight and MANY of your favorite negative income stocks are going to run out of cash in the next year, likely leading to higher unemployment.  If the Fed were to pivot, and start printing money again, well that'll only lead to an increase in gold prices...again!

&amp;#x200B;

**Why may gold not perform will in 2023**?

* **Demand Side Shock**: Any sort of demand side reduction or crazy drop in inflation, like another covid, could cause a drop in gold prices during the crisis.  However ,the aftermath/money printing and stimulus could cause gold to bounce right back up and higher than it was before.

How's hypemen like Tom Brady and Matt Damon do for investor confidence as well?  While I believe in block chain tech, let's be honest, we are probably gonna have a winter for a bit because there isn't stimmies flowing out left and right, and let's be honest, a lot of people - the later bandwagoners, probably lost a bunch of money getting into it thinking it's a store of value and valid currency and not as a speculative asset, so probably have a bad taste in their mouths.  Oh! And mining bitcoin is bad for the environment.  You can't live in the West and be pro bitcoin or you are bad heartless person: [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/eu-will-likely-ban-bitcoin-to-no-avail](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/eu-will-likely-ban-bitcoin-to-no-avail) , just like you can't be pro fossil fuels, pro meat consumption, etc... all bad people stuff.  So it's time to get with the times and be anti-cryptos as well or eventually you are a bad person too.  And you don't want to be a bad person otherwise you end up like Putin.  Cryptos soon won't be ""vogue"" anymore when the next gen of kids get brainwashed because cryptos kill polar bears.
2. Gold maintained it's value in 2022 not only because it's an inflation hedge, but also of central bank buying.  [https://www.ft.com/content/e0983ebb-bbe0-4d33-8517-e19fa06e1a77](https://www.ft.com/content/e0983ebb-bbe0-4d33-8517-e19fa06e1a77). I'll get into more why this is the case and why I think it will continue next.

**Why gold should continue to perform well in 2023**?

Too many reasons!

1. **Continued central bank buying**:  When war in Ukraine broke out, the West froze Russia's USD assets. [https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/russian-bank-foreign-reserve-billions-frozen-sanctions-n1292153](https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/russian-bank-foreign-reserve-billions-frozen-sanctions-n1292153)  Any country, that currently aren't simps for the West (China, Russia, India, Middle East, Turkey, South America, etc...) have immediately taken note of this unprecedented action by the west.  If they want to do ANYTHING that may be considered naughty naughty ü§≠ ü§´by the west, they could get their USD assets frozen.  Hence, the frenzy in all of these countries in trying to diversify their reserves away from USD into something else - which one of the new assets they are buying, besides something like the Yuan, is Gold: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-30/russia-to-raise-yuan-share-in-wealth-fund-to-60-gold-to-40?leadSource=uverify%20wall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-30/russia-to-raise-yuan-share-in-wealth-fund-to-60-gold-to-40?leadSource=uverify%20wall)  I see this trend to continue from now until de-globalization reverses, which could be quite a while.  This should prop up gold and other commodity prices.  The US is losing it's grip/influence in a lot of spaces in the world that's not the EU.  Saudi Arabia as an example.
2. **Reaching the terminal rates** :  Often times when rates rise, gold falls.  Yet, rates have risen by so much in 2022 yet gold has maintained it's price.  With the Fed supposedly reaching the end of the rate hikes and inflation supposedly peaking, this catalyst to decrease gold prices will eventually come off the table.
3. **Persistent Inflation**: While inflation is coming down, I truly do believe that the Fed will never hit it's target of 2% inflation, without completely destroying demand and causing the country to enter a deep and tough recession.  I don't see the Fed willing to raise rates so much to do that, partly because of political pressure and partly because that just creates even more issues.  As a reuslt, both demand and supply side dynamics will continue to keep inflation above 2%
   1. **Supply Side Inflation Continues**: Everyone keeps on saying supply side inflation is ""transitory"" is the same dummies that said inflation is ""transitory"".  If the west really wanted to reduce supply side inflation, they would stop fueling the war in Ukraine.  They would stop being anti fossil fuel and anti a lot of things.  That's not ending any time soon, so supply side inflation won't stop.  Additionally, given how the west is so afraid of covid, we could once again see supply side inflation if China unleashes their population to infect the world again, leading to supply chain issues.
   2. **Demand Side Inflation Continues**: Given that the Fed probably won't bring us to a deep and serious recesssion with unemployment spiking over 10% and really crushing the demand side of things, demand will never drop low enough for inflatoin to reach 2%. Additionally, the west likes to fight inflation by handing out more money.  While the Fed can stop printing, like it's been doing, goverments themselves can continue to spend with money they don't have.  California is giving out money to fight inflation: [https://www.kcra.com/article/california-inflation-relief-payments-timeframe-update-1672447464/42371519](https://www.kcra.com/article/california-inflation-relief-payments-timeframe-update-1672447464/42371519).  Same with Spain [https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/spain-announces-106-bln-package-ease-inflation-pain-2023-2022-12-27/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/spain-announces-106-bln-package-ease-inflation-pain-2023-2022-12-27/).  Politicians live for votes, so they will never be aligned with the central bank.  Like any good corporation, they care about lining their pockets now, not necessarily do what's best.  Y**ou and I like free money, so we will never say no when a politician promises us free money for votes.  There's no end to it**.
   3. **TLDR**: Western govs like to induce inflation via their policies such as anti fossile fuel, extending the war in Ukraine, locking stuff down, etc... while handing out stimmies for votes.  The central bank must fight against all that but they can only do so much without causing a real legit recession.
   4. Example: Sellers used to sell 100 widgts and buyers bought 100 widgets.  Now only 50 widgets are availalbe due to supply constraints so the price goes up.  Only 50 widgets are now sold and some people can't afford them so they miss out.  Gov hands out stimmies so now more people can afford the 50 available widgest, so it goes up further in price.
4. **Changing Fed Inflation Target**: If the Fed can't get inflation down to 2%, that will unleash another wave of lack of confidence in the USD and fed, causing real assets to go up again.  And the Fed is already laying the groundwork for this when it realizes in 2-3 years that it can't reach it's 2% goal without causing a real and deep recession.  No one wants to go in depth yet on this stark reality, but the Fed stated in it's most recent meeting that: ""**there may be a longer-run project"" that could take a fresh look at the central bank's inflation goal**. "" [https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2022-12-14/powell-says-fed-will-not-change-2-inflation-goal](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2022-12-14/powell-says-fed-will-not-change-2-inflation-goal).  Some managers are already making this claim - the Fed just has not admit it: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/bill-ackman-says-fed-s-2-inflation-target-no-longer-credible?leadSource=uverify%20wall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-14/bill-ackman-says-fed-s-2-inflation-target-no-longer-credible?leadSource=uverify%20wall).  Wait for the Fed to admit it and see what happens to commodities...
5. **Debt Ceiling Volatility**: 2023 marks a year where we may have another debt ceiling crisis.  While Reps are not as fiscally conservative as they used to be, they are still 1000% more conservative than Dems these days.  If inflation is still a hot topic, they may be able to rally around being more fiscally conservative, causing a deadlock as they control the House.  Some pundits are saying that this debt ceiling crisis could be as volatilie as the one in 2011 and 1995.  In both of those situations, gold prices popped, i personally have it going up 10% in 1995 and 20% in 2011.  While this is a small move in % terms, with the low implied volatility on gold options, it's a pretty big move within a few months. [https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/economy/debt-ceiling-fight-goldman-sachs/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/economy/debt-ceiling-fight-goldman-sachs/index.html)
6. **Petrogold And Russia**: Similar to how central banks are moving away from the USD, if Russia truly gets desperate in the war in Ukraine, they could do the nuclear option and demand gold for oil/gas.  This scneario is more of a pipe dream that gold bulls like to push and is not covered by main stream media, but it's not impossible if Putin truly becomes desperate.  [https://www.kitco.com/news/2022-12-07/If-Russia-accepts-gold-for-oil-gold-price-doubles-to-3-600-says-Credit-Suisse-s-Zoltan-Pozsar.html](https://www.kitco.com/news/2022-12-07/If-Russia-accepts-gold-for-oil-gold-price-doubles-to-3-600-says-Credit-Suisse-s-Zoltan-Pozsar.html)
7. **Fed Pivot**: I personally don't see a fed pivot occuring next year given that I don't see inflation going down to 2% and I believe the Fed is going to be cautious so we don't hit a an outright recession.  Most people say fed pivot in 2H 2023, I say 2024-2025.  With that said, the financing market is very tight and MANY of your favorite negative income stocks are going to run out of cash in the next few years, likely leading to higher unemployment.  If the Fed were to pivot, and start printing money again, well that'll only lead to an increase in gold prices...again!

**Why may gold not perform will in 2023**?

* Any sort of demand side reduction or crazy drop in inflation, like another covid, could cause a drop in gold prices during the crisis.  However ,the aftermath/money printing and stimulus could cause gold to bounce right back up and higher than it was before.

1664,wallstreetbets,"The 20 day moving average is a technical indicator that is calculated by averaging the closing prices of a security over the past 20 days. It is used to smooth out price fluctuations and provide a clearer picture of the underlying trend. Traders may use the 20 day moving average as a buy or sell signal, depending on the direction of the average and the price action of the security. For example, if the price of a security is above its 20 day moving average and the average is trending upwards, this may be seen as a buy signal. Conversely, if the price is below the average and the average is trending downwards, this may be seen as a sell signal. It is important to note that moving averages should not be used in isolation and should be used in conjunction with other technical indicators and fundamental analysis.

Here are a few more details about how the 20 day moving average can be used in trading:

Crossover signals: One way to use the 20 day moving average is to look for crossover signals, where the price of the security crosses above or below the average. If the price crosses above the average, it may be seen as a bullish signal and a potential buying opportunity. If the price crosses below the average, it may be seen as a bearish signal and a potential selling opportunity.

Support and resistance: The 20 day moving average can also act as a level of support or resistance for the price of the security. If the price is trending upwards and the 20 day moving average is flat or trending upwards, the average may act as a level of support, meaning that the price may have a hard time falling below it. Similarly, if the price is trending downwards and the average is flat or trending downwards, the average may act as a level of resistance, meaning that the price may have a hard time rising above it.

Trend confirmation: In addition to providing buy and sell signals, the 20 day moving average can also be used to confirm the direction of the trend. If the average is trending upwards and the price is also trending upwards, this may be seen as a confirmation of an uptrend. If the average is trending downwards and the price is also trending downwards, this may be seen as a confirmation of a downtrend.

It's important to keep in mind that the 20 day moving average is just one tool among many that traders can use to make decisions. It's always a good idea to use a variety of indicators and techniques in order to get a more complete picture of the market.

1692,wallstreetbets,"It seems rather strange to ask this question on a margins infested sub. I love you all.  

It is also rather obvious that *debt* is generally a bad thing and when unctrolled, it is a monster. 

The balance of political spectrum in our western society  makes the concept rather perplexing, and quiet interesting. We may not have the perfect system, but democracy and capitalism has always the better alternative. In fact the lack of better alternative is factual.

* in modern human history there has never been a proven better working system*. Not socialism, fascism, imperialism, monarchies etc. have ever produced the amount of progress that modern western democracies and capitalism  have ever achieved.  In fact China still uses forms of Capitalsim to advance.

*The perfect balance  in a political spectrum*

While the left enables the stimulus of economies to advance by spending, the right is able to disable the the switch when we start to over spend.  *Checks and balances at its finest*

You do not want the world to keep thinking  that the USD( currently the global reserve currency)  is printed recklessly, the right does a great job at  hammering down. But you also  want to inject a stimulus into an economy avoiding collapses the left does a great job at doing so through spending.

The debate should not be, in my useless opinion about more.or less spending. The debate should rather be focused on the type of spending, where is the money allocated. 

As long as America remains the world global reserve currency ( and you need it to be so for your portfolio not to collapse  )It must continue its path towards the advancement of societies and try to minimize human suffering. Now you are  likely to laugh at this, but,  the poorest person today is better off in comparison to  poorest person just about 150 years ago by a wide margin in context to all of human society put together.  And this is largely due to America's Hegenomy. 

From the first humans to just about  say 200 years ago, human advancement is at a steady rising slope, untill America, where the slope is rising at incredible rate ( elcriticy, banking , technology,  medicine, spacs ) 

Now I know you are thinking of China.

Ray Dalios principles of a world changing order is quiet amazing, and accurate but not entirely. After years of advancement and economic growth the Emerging superpower overtakes the rotted corrupt bloated lazy current superpower through a major war. 

The problem is the following: throghout history the merging superpower always ends up winning some sort of war. The problem with today is : Nuclear weapons.   There would be no one standing to take over .....

As  Albert Einstein famously once said ""World War IV would be fought with sticks and stones.""


But when in history has it been that a crash occured because of our debt ?

**January 6th 8:30 amUnemployment rate**

Unemployment is key, and all that you have to do is read the last meetings transcript: 

Let start with his last sentence the conclusion :

**Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. 
Thank you. I will look forward to your questions.**


*Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the 
unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated. 
Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 272,000 jobs per month 
over the last three months. Although job vacancies have moved below their highs and the pace 
of job gains has slowed from earlier in the year, the labor market continues to be out of balance, 
with demand substantially exceeding the supply of available workers. The labor force 
participation rate is little changed since the beginning of the year. FOMC participants expect 
supply and demand conditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing 
upward pressures on wages and prices. The median projection in the SEP for the unemployment 
rate rises to 4.6 percent at the end of next year.*

That being said : 

On January 6th 
**In 2023, the full Moon rises on January 6** Traditionally, this full Moon was called the ‚ÄúWolf Moon,‚Äù appearing when wolves howled outside the villages in hunger. The January Moon has also been called the Old Moon.

There are so many methods, but some say to buy during a full moon and sell during a new moon. Other do the opposite.

1729,wallstreetbets,"Hello, 


And because¬†timing the market perfectly is nearly impossible, the best strategy for most of us is not to try to market-time at all

New low? February? March ? 

Bare with me, I know I will be given a bunch of ""what if"" in this post. This is because truly this whole market is but what ifs...unless we back test like algorithmic traders, even then they fail.

Because of the amount certainty from analysts and news outlets  that we are due for a recession and markets are going to sh*t,  it is almost impossible not to question the validty of such predictions. 

*Could it be possible that everyone will be correct in 2023 ?* yes to both bears and bulls...

On both sides at the end they may say .... I told you so.

How ? Simply put: Economic Data and Sentiment. 

For the first half of 2022, the economic data suggested we are in deep sh*t.  While the second half shows there might be hope.

The sentiment at the end of 2022 is that 2023 we are going to hell.


What if  the market doesn't give a sh*t about your feelings. 

Lets say CPI comes in way better then expected ? 

What if inflation  is reduced again 

What if unemployment rising perfect to the point feds go down to .25 or even 0


Any of those will shake the ground you walk on. 

And voila the S&amp;P rages to new highs, then quickly analysts  pound the tables and suggest the market is much to overbought, etc etc. 

Boom !!!  sell off.

Back to the bottom.. then the story repeats itself.

What if simply, we hit a new high/low followed by a new low/high

1747,wallstreetbets,"I have been trading since 2006 and have never seen one side so sure the market is going to crash even more after one of the worst years ever.
I follow 12 trading ‚Äúexperts‚Äù that I feel are best-in-class and they all see the market still not bottoming until March/April 23‚Äô.
Almost every ‚Äúwall street expert‚Äù is predicting the market to go lower.
Morgan Stanley can‚Äôt keep saying it enough that the market is going to 3,300.
Puts are at an all time high, literally, everyone is betting on the same thing to happen. I don‚Äôt know anyone who has a significant call option for the market to be higher in Q1 of next year.

The thing is about this, is that it‚Äôs not like people are waiting on the market to finally fall, it‚Äôs been violently falling for an entire year. So much that traders have no faith in stocks anymore as seen with the options chains - and no one wants to touch risk on plays. 

What‚Äôs the more likely scenario?
- Everyone is right, history repeats itself, except this time everyone is prepared and makes a ton of money off the next leg down on the most crowded trade of the century 
Or
- Everyone has no clue what will happen. They just expect history to repeat itself and believe that the banks and Wall Street are trying to warn everyone of a market crash because they only have retails best interest in mind and care about you. In this case, the market does what it does best - shakes out the crowded trade until everyone believes the market is going to recover before pulling the rug once put volume comes way down.

TLDR: What‚Äôs your thought on the most crowded trade of the century?

I have recently moved to solely options in the past 11 months. on the 21st will be a full year with the account netting a profit of 43%. I am psychopathic when it comes to money and stocks as I have realized my potential. I have adopted this crazy money driven mindset in the past year where all I think about is money and dedicate about 6 hrs a day to the market. I don't value school as I am a junior and the only class I take that I value is my AP Econ class. I have a 50 year personalized flow chart till I plan to retire at about 65. I caddie at a very prestigious golf club where I interact with very many high profile individuals and have two possible internships lined up this summer because of people I have met and connections I have made (I caddie literally 1-2 times every single day in the summer). It sounds crazy but I have everything planned down to the year. I have very many possibilities in the sector though. I feel I will most likely go to college for Finance, hop around a bit with a firm, until I eventually start my own hedge fund (it will happen). I believe the connections I have made and will continue to make will provide very generous seed funding for my plan and I believe as I have only known trading in the bear market, I will succeed even more in the bull.

## How Gold Royalties Outperform Gold and Mining Stocks

Gold and gold mining companies have long provided a diverse option for investors looking for gold-backed returns, however royalty companies have quietly been outperforming both.

While inflation‚Äôs recent surge has dampened profits for gold mining companies, royalty companies have remained immune thanks to their unique structure, offering stronger returns in both the short and long term.

After [Part One](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/how-gold-royalties-offer-inflation-resistant-gold-exposure/) of this series sponsored by [Gold Royalty](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/company_spotlight/gold-royalty-corp/?utm_source=vc-web&amp;u[%E2%80%A6]dium=Infographic-Sponsored-1&amp;utm_campaign=vc-goldroyalty) explained exactly how gold royalties avoid rising expenses caused by inflation, Part Two showcases the resulting stronger returns royalty companies can offer.

## Comparing Returns

Since the pandemic lows in mid-March of 2020, gold royalty companies have greatly outperformed both gold and gold mining companies, shining especially bright in the past year‚Äôs highly [inflationary environment](https://elements.visualcapitalist.com/largest-gold-mines-by-production/).

While gold is up by 9% since the lows, gold mining companies are down by almost 3% over the same time period. On the other hand, gold royalty companies have offered an impressive **33%** **return** for investors.

1814,wallstreetbets,"As we enter the new year of 2023, it's natural to feel a sense of uncertainty about the future of the stock market. However, it's important to remember that the stock market has always been and will continue to be a source of long-term growth for investors. While there may be ups and downs in the short-term, the overall trend of the stock market has been upward over the long run.

There are several reasons to be optimistic about the stock market in 2023. Firstly, the global economy is showing signs of recovery after the challenges of the past few years. This is good news for companies, as a strong economy typically leads to strong corporate profits. When companies are profitable, their stock prices tend to rise, which is good news for investors.

Secondly, the rollout of vaccines for COVID-19 is providing a much-needed boost to the economy. As more and more people are vaccinated, restrictions on businesses and travel are being lifted, leading to increased consumer spending and economic activity. This bodes well for the stock market, as companies stand to benefit from the increased demand for their products and services.

In addition, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it plans to continue supporting the economy by keeping interest rates low. Low interest rates make it cheaper for companies to borrow money, which can be used to invest in growth. This can lead to increased stock prices for these companies.

Finally, it's important to remember that the stock market is a forward-looking indicator. This means that it reflects investors' expectations for the future, rather than just current economic conditions. With the economy showing signs of recovery and the rollout of vaccines providing a path out of the pandemic, it's reasonable to expect that investors will have a more optimistic outlook on the future.

In summary, while there will always be risks and uncertainties in the stock market, there are several reasons to be optimistic about the market in 2023. A recovering global economy, the rollout of vaccines, and supportive monetary policy are all factors that point to potential growth in the stock market this year. As always, it's important to diversify your portfolio and consult with a financial advisor to make informed investment decisions.","2023 market prediction, what you guys think?",1672595309

with the rising cost of interest/liquidity i decided to look into corporate bonds that will need to be refinanced in the next two years. AAPL has two loans/bonds that expire in 2023 (one for 5.5b and another for idk look it up) 

this is clearly not financial advice but it does seem that when the loans expire AAPL will need to either use the cash on hand to pay off the debt or refinance at todays interest rates which would eat into their margin for years forward. 

this is a hypothesis and i likely will not act on it myself. i am new to investing but old to finance and do not have any experience surrounding how loans due in high interest rate environments effects the overall equity value per share when they uh refinance or use COH

That having been said, this stock has been sitting between $5 and $6 a share forever.  MDGL posts good data on their NASH drug, and VKTX pops past $9.  Here's my opinion.   NASH is a big scene and from the trial data I've read, it LOOKS like VKTX has a better drug.  Not just that but applications beyond just NASH like weightloss (another big sector) plus a pipeline of 5 other drugs in niche but undeserved areas.  On top of that, a 5 year cash runway.  

YES, they are suing a Chinese company for theft of their molecule - which tells me the molecule is WORTH stealing!  And if proven, that other company - even if they manage to bring it to market - will get frozen out of American markets.  Short interest is 1.8 M of a 3 M volume and 2.8 % of float.  Plus out of 9 analysts, it shows a low 12 month of $11, mid at $18, and a high of $30 projected.

Basically from my 3 minutes of research I've determined that banks make more monies from interest rates going up and banks have been pretty beat up lately, and Bank of America ($BAC) is a bank stock that hasn't already had a massive shrek candle like ($JPM), also from this healthy pullback I've also gotten an alert on my stock indicator that we going up soon. Anyways yeah, game plan on Tuesday is to go all in on $BAC stonk and buy as many shares as possible, also the stock bounced off resistance recently and just looks like it's going to go higher and break the 200 day moving average, earning have also been ight, that's about it tbh, uh what else, oh yeah I'm not a financial advisor. My price target is $34.5, a roughly 4% return from the current $33.18 per share price. I expect this price target to be hit within 1-2 weeks, stop loss will be at $32 per share or roughly a -3.5% decrease from the current price. If you have a big boy account just buy shares, if you want to leverage and go with options I recommend buy the  **BAC $34 Call 1/27/2023** option. Keep in mind the only thing that could ruin this trade is if the S&amp;P 500 decides to crash, I doubt it will, but who knows. As such I'm going to just stick to buying shares with my stop loss, however if I were to go with buying the options I wouldn't buy heavy and I'd be mentally prepared to lose it all or use a -50% stop loss, the call options are pretty cheap right now. Yes I consider my educated gambler thoughts as DD, later",$BAC stock is looking good for a long call,1672546445

The day after I published the post, CSI 300 (ASHR) &amp; BABA, took a dive 3% and 9% respectively. From there, it was an extremely painful 2 months, as my pair trade of long Chinese and short US equities backfired spectacularly with SPY rising 12% in 1 month while ASHR and BABA went down 8% and 15% respectively.

Currently things are looking better, with short positions on SPY and QQQ more than offset losses from going long on Chinese equities.

I'm still bullish on Chinese equities:

\- China reopened, retail sale data for January / February should be interesting to watch and can be a huge catalyst. It is always the darkest before the dawn.  
\- Real estate developers stabilized with greater access to credit, however this should put a downward pressure on house prices as more inventory gets delivered, putting a damper on consumer sentiment.  
\- Dovish central bank is set to lower rates again next year with even looser financing conditions.  
\- Even though Xi crowned himself king, government repeatedly signalled support for private enterprises and there's no u-turns from its previous directions.  
\- Short positions / negative sentiment on ASHR has been decreasing (below is the amount shares lent short from my account)

I'm still negative on U.S. equities:

\- Fed will hold rate constant @ \~ 5%, unless something truly breaks, rate will hold there for a long time until QT drains all the excess cash from the system, which could take 1 - 2 years. With ample reserve policy, it will be hard for something to truly break since there's always ample liquidity.  
\- BOJ ""raised"" 10 year interest rate from 0.25% to 0.4-0.5%, and with inflation hitting Japan domestically, its highly likely BOJ will abandon their YCC policy next year, which will put upward pressure on bond yields across the world.  
\- Assuming current 4  - 5% interest to continue for 1 - 2 years, and there's no meaningful growth in earnings, US equities (especially QQQ @ 25 P/E) are not attractive compare to short term bonds.

Current positions:

2076,wallstreetbets,"First off, I am aware that NVDA literally got cut in half YTD.
So, on average, shorting it throughout 2022 has been a massively profitable undertaking and ""the time to buy puts was exactly 1 year ago"".

With those snarky comments out of the way, NVDA is still sitting on a PE of ~62 and forward PE of ~38.

That seems way too high in the current macroeconomic environment.

* Fed isn't done raising rates yet. We are yet to reach the terminal rate and they have been clear in wanting to keep it there for a while.
* Rates take some time to work through the real economy. I do think we haven't seen the pain JPOW spike of, at least in the real economy.
* There's been real and heavy gamer backlash against the 4000 series GPUs when prices where revealed. Gamers genuinely think NVDA has lost the plot and think they can charge whichever price.
* Coupled with the end of GPU crypto mining, the market is flooded with cheap and still very high performance 3000 series GPUs, not generating any revenue for NVDA.
* Their GPUs are used for state of the art AI projects in other companies. I'm far from an expert but those are expensive projects and could easily be perceived as ""not  essential in these trying times"" making said companies pause these projects, reducing yet again demand for NVDA's GPUs.



As I said, yes the stock has lost 50% in 2022 so some of the above has definitely been priced in.
**What is going to drive demand for their products in such a way that they meet revenue and EPS targets? Let alone allow them to give upbeat guidance?** 



***Positions***: none so far, thinking about throwing a few grand into longer dated puts.

Calling all devil advocates to come up with a bullish reasoning to spark discussion and gauge if the ship has sailed for this dumb gamble or the bearish reasoning does hold merit and is an educated guess that should net profits.

2082,wallstreetbets," 

As a dividend-growth investor, I'm always looking for better ways to evaluate the investment quality of a stock individually as well as part of my broader portfolio. In the very beginning I used to heavily invest in stocks that were Dividend Aristocrats. But I started asking questions such as, how are these stocks performing compared to their peers. Are there stocks with better performing ROEs? What level of risk (Sharpe ratio) was taken to achieve those earnings? What is the forecasted earnings growth over the next 5 years? How many consecutive years have they increased dividends? What's their payout ratio? What are analysts thinking? Are there sectors/industries I'm overinvested or underinvested in?

So I decided to write some programs to pull free financial data from multiple sources. I consolidate all of these different data sources, cleanse and standardize the data, and came up with my own scoring metric on how to rank each stock. It does lean more towards small cap stocks which I typically avoid, but it's still informative to know what ranks high. The metrics I use for calculating my score include metrics such as Current Dividend Yield, 5-yr Forecasted Earnings Growth, ROE, Payout Ratio, Sharpe Ratio, Piotroski F Score, Dividend List Membership (Aristocrats, Champions, Kings, etc.) and it favors stocks with strong histories of paying quality dividends. I try not to give any one metric too much weight.

Pasted below is a link to a GoogleSheets spreadsheet that has the entire list. Hopefully you can use the data to make more informed investing decisions.

What are your thoughts on my top rankings? Any surprises? Any questions on any particular metric? Hopefully it has provided you with extra investment insight. I'm always looking for ways to refine my methodology and scoring, so any suggestions would be appreciated.

2159,wallstreetbets,"Hey tards, 

This is just my thought process before the new year, so don't take it too seriously. I may even have an extra chromosome... 


I'll go from macro to micro or whatever... 


Globally, swords are drawn. But let's look where we're at. Monetary policy, inflation, and international trade numbers first:


**China:** 

It's up to you to trust data coming out of Pooh Bear's rear side. 

Inflation around 2%, 

One year lending rate at 3.65%

International Trade Surplus: Around $60 Billion per month


**US:**

Inflation: Just above 7% 

Interest rate: 4.5%

Trade deficit: Around $70-75 Billion per month


**EU**

Europoors are just doing Europoor things. 

Inflation: Around 10%

Interest Rate: 2%

Trade Deficit: Around $40-45 Billion per month


**Japan**

Inflation: around 3.5%

Interest Rate: 0.5%

Trade Deficit: Around $12-13 Billion per month



Japan and EU have had trade deficits since covid which is a reversal to what had been the norm previously. 


Trade deficits weakened their currency, weak currency increased their deficit due to reliance of imported raw materials and increasing energy prices. So now they have increased their negative rates for the first time - which may be a bit late but we shall see. 


QE ran its course and now global tightening policies are in effect. But real interest rates are still absurdly negative so there is that and fed believes liquidity in the markets is a good thing so junk bonds can live another day... or whatevs. 


ECB is tightening a bit more aggressively and actually going to pull some liquidity for the first time since early 2000s. They are starting with something around 300 Billion Euros. Also ECB's minimum reserve mandate is in effect, whereas in the US IIRC there is still no minimum reserve requirement for banks. 


So what are these telling me? China has no liquidity issues and is still able to push strong export numbers despite covid. EU is struggling and trying to do the right thing which is too naive I think. US is a fucking shitshow; it's still pretty much BRrrrr but with higher nominal interest rates. Japan is holding steady and trying to manage Yen's value only. 


I don't think we will see a collapse of a market this year. Even as a gay bear, I just don't see it. I can see the collapse of USD at some point before 2030, but I don't see how markets can crash with this much liquidity pumped in to the system. 


What's concerning is Europoors' honest attempt to do QT right. Where the hell have you been in the last year when inflation got out of hand? Maybe they thought it would just go back to normal as supply chain issues are resolved. Again... how naive. I strongly believe EU will be abolished in the next 2-3 years. 


Another concerning trend is lack of velocity of money. Money isn't going around in the real economy. It doesn't make as many stops in a month as it used to. Banks are creating too much overhead in the system and are too efficient to collect everything from real economy and pump into finance. It's not just us. It's a whole trend. Every time someone outbids other prospective buyers above asking at a home purchase, every time you decide to finance something beyond your means, every time you ""invest"" instead of spending, money gets sucked up into finance and does not trickle down much. So now we're at our limit. Consumer debt is gonna bite North Americans in the ass. 


Anyhow... I just cracked another cold one. 


Recession is already in the room with us. It has been. All this extra juicy M2 is not for nothing. People panicked; Simple as that. Covid hit and people started reevaluating their life choices and sitting at home during lockdowns was an eye opening experience for many. Why do we have to go to the office? Why do we have to work 40 hours and still can't have the basics? Very legitimate questions that got no real answer from those in the government. These are thanks to boomers getting the fuck out of workforce because they already got everything. It finally sank in with them. Wealth gap is at a whole other level now and monkeys want more peanuts. 


Many industries started downsizing like tech. They will stay lean for a few years at least. So if you're in tech get ready for your new norm. 


Currently we are rolling back globalization at some level and spreading it on others. For example, supply chain issues made countries realize the importance of building at home rather than relying on imports for essential and strategic goods and services. On the other hand, globally, those that do produce and export, like China, will benefit bigly until they can't.


There is a whole restructuring happening and the biggest opportunity is right in front of your eyes. You just gotta decide when is a good time to get in. All these investments to adapt to the NOT new world order will eventually bear fruit. But, let's not forget, globalization occurred due to necessity. Economies of scale allowed lower prices and low margins with high revenues. This is not coming back. In a world separated into new axes, we will have new equilibriums in different markets. Consumer prices were suppressed so much between mid 2000s to 2020. It's only catching up to what it should have been. You're paying so much more for many services, education, homes etc. You think cost of producing most household items or produce stayed the same all this time? Tech improvements and economies of scale allowed that. We ain't got that economies of scale and efficient supply chain no more. 


The only way this will all make sense is with inflated real estate prices going back to somewhere attainable by working people. Currently working class in North America is being paid piss pour in relation to cost of living in our countries, and being paid a few times more than someone doing the same job in a developing country. They just can't afford to pay you more due to global competition. Distribution of money has always been the biggest flaw and here we are trying to figure it out again...

* Santa Claus Rally average from 1970 to 2021 is **1.29%.**
* Santa Claus Rally 10 year moving average, not including 2022, currently sitting at **0.7%.**
* S&amp;P500 annual average from 1970 to 2022 is **8.96%.**

Interesting to note the Santa Claus Rally accounts for only **3%** of trading days for the year however, it's returns account for over **14%** of the S&amp;P500's average annual return.  Which means on average we're around **5 times** more likely to make a profit 'going long' during this period than any other time of the year.

Is it not common knowledge that compared to the peer group tesla is massively overvalued? ‚ÄûConsumer pseudo experts‚Äú will claim that this is future earning potential that tesla has, as it has a head start in the ev market. But this is simply not true. Tesla has some small advantages such as vertical integration for battery production that easily get cancelled by poor quality design, lack of service network, no alternative for long range vehicles etc‚Ä¶
Once battery and charging technology, as well as electrical supply and infrastructure are ready to make pure EV main stream capable, all other automobile manufacturers will have 1:1 competitive cars of which the americans have more experience in heavy duty, the asians have more experience in budget manufacturing and the germans more experience in luxury and quality technology.

I mentioned this pattern yesterday in my TA on SPY. With 378 clearly being ‚Äúbottom‚Äù for the foreseeable future I envision this to be our next pattern to play out. This would give us a rally in January. I would start to eye a retest of 405 to 415 area through the month of January. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lyd00xwk349a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d660be22e451d52ce200aaafb64b44f1c12fcdfb

I started to analyze the 2022 bear channel weekly movement. When we take a look at it you can see we have this cycle of peak at channel resistance -&gt; short drop -&gt; short peak -&gt; full dump -&gt; retest of channel resistance. We have been in this pattern all year long. We did however, break through that channel resistance of the 2022 bear channel the day of CPI. However we fell through it and we have not touched it since. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fv3enibl349a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eaa5779e08b3f4ca19bbcc6e3969c038c3c258fa

Taking a look at the cycle you can we just had a 21 day 8.7% drop for our first short drop‚Ä¶ this SHOULD be followed up with about 50-75% of the length and 56% of the distance recovery‚Ä¶ so that means we should be looking at about a 10-14 day 4.8% recovery minimum. 

That would put SPY at the week of 1/16 to 1/20 near 393 minimum. 393 on the weekly timeframe is actually the red bear channels resistance line. That is my target for next week. 

Taking a look at the structure of the last two weekly candles you can see they are back to back gravestone dojis that came down and bounced off that 376 area and their candle bodies held support at 383 level too. 

We have been waiting for the 390 resistance retest and I believe that is our target for next week. 

Key support- 375.6 -&gt; 363.7   
 key resistance- 390.1 -&gt; 398.8 

&amp;#x200B;

Taking a look at the futures daily chart you can see we are in a massive breakout pattern right here. We did double top off that 3870 key level, however, as you can see we closed out with a massive wick to the downside. With this close this should be seen as a bullish candle for Monday. I would be shocked to not see us breakout over 3870 Tuesday and I will be eyeing a touch of 3910 to 3920. That would be a 1.1 to 1.3% green day on Tuesday.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9litiegm349a1.png?width=694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e899a916e30a8ff2f93c54808754ec29aafc5bee

Besides the June quarterly the last 3 out of 4 quarterlies have opened green. The biggest open was 1.1% at the September quarterly and the lowest is 0.28% for an average of 0.58% green open on the day after quarterly. 

Something else I had noted for Tuesday DTE options is that the IV closed in the 11s. This is VERY low for SPY IV. Generally almost every morning opens with an IV of 25-30% and slowly ends around 20%. With an IV pump and high probability green open I found a call swing worth the risk for Tuesday. That was also a very bullish finish to the day, week and year. The bears no matter how many times they tried to break us down the last two weeks were not able to. 

My only hope for 2023 is that we finally get some real direction and that the technicals come back into play better.

I mentioned the inverse head and shoulders on SPY daily and honestly its kinda ugly but I do see it forming here on futures weekly. I could see us reading 4200 by middle of February.

As bearish as I want to be and as bearish as I believe the markets tried to be today it just couldn‚Äôt do it. The bears do not have the momentum right now to break us down further. 

&amp;#x200B;

A couple important things to note ahead in the month of January. 

First up on Wednesday (2 days into the new trading year!) we have FOMC minutes (I will have a detailed trade plan posted sometime this weekend for that!)‚Ä¶ followed the next day by ADP followed by unemployment rate (The last three have resulted in 1%+/- openings)‚Ä¶ And then finally the week after that we have CPI on Thursday January 12th. 

A big first two weeks of the year. The question is‚Ä¶. Will FOMC minutes remind the market of how bearish JPOW was or much like in November where we had a massive red FOMC the markets didn‚Äôt care and we ripped on FOMC minutes hitting the wire. 

I remain going forward bullish until markets prove me otherwise‚Ä¶ things that COULD prove me otherwise‚Ä¶ 1. Closing AND holding below 378. 2. VIX popping and holding over 25+ or 3. A huge miss on CPI. I don‚Äôt at this moment forsee any of those coming true‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nup9bq5o349a1.png?width=764&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6150120f5b2c6b522d458bbbe68b03b3d237db3c

And then there was‚Ä¶ Tesla‚Ä¶. 

After absolutely being slammed the whole month of December I have to give it to the tesla bulls and say they finished on a very positive note! 

Taking a look at our cycles we can officially say we have closed out our downward cycle on Tuesday. That remains the longest and biggest drop tesla has seen during this sell off period. 

Looking at the trend we should be expecting about a 4 day 14% rally. However, we have to remember that Tesla put in double its usual sell off‚Ä¶ perhaps we get double the recovery? 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/08ws3kpo349a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2c3b4309647308b917fb9f58d453fd76a4e67e3

Taking a look at the tesla daily I have to say this candle body structure is both impressive and confusing. Yesterday Tesla put in a 8.08% green bullish day‚Ä¶ however, today only putting in 1.12% green actually was a bullish engulfing candle of a green candle. That is not something you see too often at all. 

Things to note here is that we are sitting at key 123.2 resistance and we did not quite touch the daily 8ema. SPY is going to need to breakout over the daily 8ema in order for me to be bullish more than Tuesday. However, if this is a double recovery on Tesla we could be looking for sometime before 1/9 for Tesla to retest the 136 to 140 area. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fhf3tw7p349a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3ed06303de64e8aadabb3aaab2e6bd93b692c8d

I mentioned last week in my weekly TA that tesla is in a cycle of 3 red weeks followed by a recovery/ consolidation week before the next leg down. Taking a look at the weekly here Tesla could have an impressive pop all the way to 147 and still be in that broadened red bear channel.

There also should be noted a critical bounce occurred off that 11.4 support that dates back to 2020. With that level holding and Tesla receiving a decent bounce and forming this possible morning star doji I am bullish for tesla going into the first week of the year. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7r6z6m9q349a1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbb1a082433f7fbbac33dc4e86d6f3d5526397ea

The VIX has been detached from reality but at times the structure remains impressively accurate. We failed now for 6 days in a row for the VIX to close a candle over 22.2. With these 6 rejections here (in addition to the 8 out of 9 last daily candles that have held 3845 support on futures) I remain once again bullish for next week. 

This evening doji star pattern formed here on the VIX should take the VIX down to about 21.2 Tuesday. We as you can see inside of this blue bear channel are maintaining a breakout/down triangle also. Unless the VIX opens over 22 (+1.5%) at open and all day that will be a break through of support and that should start the next leg down on the VIX and subsequently the next leg up on the markets. This movement should take us into CPI week.

Before someone says why am I not posting a broker screenshot‚Ä¶ well I have moved money throughout the year and also changed brokers and accounts during the year and I frequently take money out of my options account. I also couldn‚Äôt find data from January as I was still working full time back then and didn‚Äôt keep records like I do now. 

But taking a look at this the biggest thing that strikes me here is a few things. 1. The fact that my worst weeks win rate was during a green week is crazy to me. But this was back in February when we had those massive $10-$14 days and we could pick up 100-150% wins like it was easy. Aint doing that shit no more that‚Äôs for sure. 

The other thing that is intriguing to me is that my average win rate on a losing and winning week is only a 6% difference. Tells you the overall power of stop losses. Also intriguing and I think really makes a statement is the fact that I had a really 2.5 month long stretch of straight struggling was still able to close out a really green year. This is where small wins over time average out to be huge wins. There is no reason to look for massive win after massive win. And if you have a really bad stretch that is okay its not the end of the world. 

Something else that really helped me this year too is that when I noticed I was struggling in June I sized down heavily on my position size and I still have not sized back up yet fully to that full position size I was using up until June. 

Overall a pretty great year despite the bullshit that 2022 presented us. I look forward to 2023 and I hope whether bull, bear or flat that we can at least get a market that is rational and obeys the technicals.

Pretty light trading today. Had that really nice swing win over night which covered some earlier losses in the week. After that the tight morning range and the absolutely mind numbingly boring price action I didn‚Äôt trade a whole lot. Took a lotto put around that big after noon dump time and took a nice win. Closed around 22% and it went on to be well over 100%...   
 

Overall honestly despite closing a green week (mostly thanks to that swing put over night‚Ä¶ I really didn‚Äôt feel like I had my best week of trading. I would have liked to have a better week than I did but I felt like iw as struggling with the technicals this week. Felt like by time my setup finally signal a buy for something the move either never happened or it just straight reversed on us. Even today during PH which granted this was expected to be a highly volatile PH‚Ä¶  the 315pm candle was red and a massive gravestone doji rejecting off a key resistance level. With that double top the 1min, 5min and 15min all being overbought and volume switching over to sell‚Ä¶ we should have seen a bigger drop but what did we see? We saw a huge pop of another 0.6% in the last 30 minutes.

Weeks like this as someone who trades with a clear cut and dry strategy it makes it extremely hard to take positions. I find myself looking at price action alone and seeing trades develop but being unable to take those trades because of how the indicators are presenting themselves. 

Tough week for sure. Hoping now that we got the collar rolled, tax loss harvesting is over and everything that we can finally see some normalcy in the markets again next week.

Since when is everyone this much correct and all predicting s major crash ?  

Maybe the majority of you are wrong as trading algorythms are reading your puts. Perhaps a crash is to occur only after your stop losses hit when a major bull run occurs early on, then followed by the crash you all have been waiting for only to bring you back to 2022 levels.  

Simply we go up , and back down to where we started 2023.

We all know that the  feds ultimate goal is to reduce inflation, but the target to do so is unemployment. It is much to obvious that supply chain is starting to ease and  supply is meeting demand.  Supply chain caused inflation is out of the table for 2023, pehaps a little but the majority will coke from unemployment being to low.

But unemployment  is already starting to come down and the next job report will signal even more reasons for feds to slow down rates. 

Before the big dip there shall be a big rip.  likely in my opinion start of 2023, why?  Because of unemployment declining.

IRS announces delay for implementation of $600 reporting threshold for third-party payment platforms‚Äô Forms 1099-K

Through the American Rescue Plan of 2021, if you sold over $600 through third party payment platforms like Paypal or Venmo, you would automatically be sent a 1099-K

The IRS is basically saying that they will ignore this for 2022 and start this in 2023.

Now it's unclear if there will be a change to this. There's currently a few bills trying to change this.

Senator Hassan has the **Cut the Red Tape for online sales act** that would increase the threshold to $5,000

Senator Cramer has the **Stop the Nosy Obsession with Online Payments Act of 2022 (SNOOP)**

This bill will essentially eliminate the $600 and get us back to the good days of $20,000 and 200 transactions.

So obviously, this $600 limit might be annoying if you're just a small time casual seller trying to sell some stuff on Ebay.

Anywho, hope you found this helpful","For all of you on your side hustle, the IRS announces delay of $600 limit for 1099-k third party payment platforms",1672433678

2418,wallstreetbets,"With tomorrow being New Years Eve, the illiquid market has slowed down as traders are closing up their books for the year. 

Winding down any ideas and thoughts, its important to see what is waiting for us up ahead. This week, the biggest story is Tesla's brutal December decline as it went down about 40% in value. As popular as it is, Elon Musk's Twitter has cost more time taking away from the automobile company. Tesla is currently at its lowest since August 2020. It will be exciting to see what Elon Musk has planned to recover his losses. 

Another notable decrease was in the NASDAQ 100, following in suit with Tesla. From a technical perspective, the 10,500 area is a critical level. In addition to marking the 2022 lows, it also represents the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the entire post-Covid rally. While bulls would certainly like to see a big rally off this support confluence, the bigger picture outlook for the index will remain bearish as long as it continues to put in ‚Äúlower highs‚Äù on the daily chart. Meanwhile, a confirmed break below support in the 10,500 area would open the door for a continuation down to the pre-Covid high at 9,700 or even the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement near 8,900 as we move through the first quarter of 2023.

2424,wallstreetbets,"Attention all WallStreetBets traders - it's time to get your portfolio pine-y fresh. That's right, I'm talking about investing in the greatest asset of all: pine trees.

Now, I know what you're thinking. ""Pine trees? That's the lamest investment ever. Where's the upside?"" But let me tell you, these trees are the ultimate stealth growth stock.

First of all, pine trees are renewable. Unlike those fancy tech companies that are constantly on the verge of being disrupted, pine trees just keep on growing. And as they grow, they produce oxygen, which is basically like free money in the form of air.

But that's not all. Pine trees can also be used to make paper and furniture, so you're basically getting a two-for-one investment. And have you seen how beautiful they look in the winter? They're like the Christmas trees of the investment world. Plus, they make for great holiday decorations, so you can literally decorate your house with your investments. Talk about killing two birds with one stone.

But let's say you're not a fan of the winter or holiday decorations. That's okay, because pine trees have you covered year-round. In the summer, they provide shade and a nice, refreshing scent. And in the fall, they turn a beautiful golden color, making for some stunning autumn foliage.

Now, I know some of you might be skeptical. ""But what about the risks?"" you might ask. Well, pine trees do have one weakness - they're susceptible to pine beetles. But don't worry, we've got that covered. Just invest in a can of bug spray and you're good to go.

Plus, pine trees have been around for centuries, so you know they're not going anywhere anytime soon. They may not have the flashy returns of some of those trendy tech stocks, but they're a solid, long-term hold. And let's face it, pine trees are just plain cool. Who wouldn't want to have a tree in their portfolio?

So don't miss out on this opportunity to get your portfolio pine-y fresh. Trust me, you won't regret it. Just don't try to shake them for their pinecones - trust me, it's not worth the splinters.

In conclusion, pine trees are the ultimate investment. They're renewable, they produce oxygen, they can be used to make paper and furniture, and they look beautiful year-round. Plus, they're a solid, long-term hold with minimal risks.

So don't sleep on pine trees, folks. They may not be the sexiest investment, but they're a solid choice for any portfolio. Just make sure to invest in some bug spray to keep those pesky pine beetles at bay.

And remember, this is not actual financial advice. Do your own research and invest wisely. Pine trees are not a guaranteed investment and may not yield any returns. Do not try to shake them for their pinecones. Happy investing!",I told Chat-GPT to write a Wallstreetbets shitpost about pine trees. This is what it came up with.,1672428877

I‚Äôve just followed the statements of the FDIC ( https://twitter.com/wallstreetsilv/status/1608510850700017667?s=61&amp;t=GQYIGwNvdNZ7t3fsj3t2AQ ), which concerns me a tiny bit for him.
As he worries about the financial situation as well, he now (legally, I might add) has opened a bank account in Switzerland and has deposited about 700k over there in Euro ( his reasoning was because in a total crash event, he still would have to pay the remaining bills in Euro ).
The bank in Switzerland says, that the Swiss state is liable for that money, meanwhile german banks are only liable for a maximum of 100k ‚Ç¨ per bank.

Question: I wonder what you think,

So usually wallstreetbets will find a meme stock and then we all load up on calls and buy shares, shorts have to cover, and then the stock price rockets.  

I know people will get upset when I say this, but most of the price increase is caused by a gamma squeeze and not shorts covering.

Now, because easy money is gone in the markets it is tough to find a stock that can run from shorts covering and a gamma squeeze. **This is where the genius idea comes in.**  Because of the way that the options market works we can: instead of pushing the price of stocks up... send them right into the ground.

**Let me explain:**

Typically when everyone on WSB loads up on calls for a meme stock, market makers who sold you those call contracts try to remain delta neutral (they only make money through the spread of the bid/ask of the contracts).  When the stock price increases the calls that everyone bought become closer to ITM which increases the delta, and because of this the market maker is forced to buy more shares to remain delta neutral.  Which then increases the price more, so they have to buy more and more shares pretty much.  This is what causes that huge exponential run-up we see at the top of meme stocks.

**We can make money the other way:**

Instead of looking for a stock that has way too many people stuck in short positions, buy calls, force them to cover, and profit.  We can do the exact opposite. *Look for a stock that has way too many people stuck in long positions, buy puts, force them to sell, and profit.* 

Inverse gamma squeezes work the same way here, market makers who sell us the put contracts will want to remain delta neutral so they will sell shares.  When the puts become closer to ITM the market maker will have to sell more shares to remain delta neutral.  This then pushes the price down and they have to sell more and more shares.  It will cause an exponential move downward.

The most recent stock this has happened to is Tesla.  Way too many people were leveraged on long positions and when speculators started loading up on puts the stock went into a freefall.

He knows that the majority of the recent decrease in Tesla's share price has been caused by an unusual amount of speculators loading up on put contracts.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion / TLDR:** 

Instead of looking for good companies that are over-shorted and then we load on calls... We look for poop companies that are over-longed and then load on puts.

2508,wallstreetbets,"Energy Transfer is a midstream oil and natural gas company operating largely in the transportation of natural gas in Texas, the Midwest to PA and NY, with certain LNG export capacity.  They have a present P/E of 8.8, a 36-billion-dollar market cap, and a 7.3% annual dividend.

Why you should consider buying:

Fundamentals:

ET has been consistently improving their balance sheet while also increasing their quarterly dividend this demonstrates a fundamentally healthy company. Further, ET has made several large acquisitions expanding their network to increase market share both locally and internationally.  The present political environment makes construction of new pipelines difficult, however this is an advantage for established companies with existing pipelines.  ET has one of the largest pipeline networks in America.

Catalysts:

 In 2021 the state of Texas froze.  This drove the local price paid for natural gas to all time highs. In addition, natural gas deliveries set new records to supply heating power to the poorly insulated homes and businesses of the Southern US. This resulted in a quarterly earnings beat of 89% over expectations.  

This December, the US suffered a similar (albeit less catastrophic) freeze. ET is well positioned to have once again profited greatly, both from deliveries and arbitrage from this event.  At present it does not appear that the markets have priced in this freeze as earnings estimates do not appear to have changed, and the stock price remains largely unchanged.

Pattern of Price Movement:

ET for the last 4 quarters has shown a consistent run up in price prior to earnings, then followed by a decrease in price after earnings and prior to the Ex-Dividend date. The most recent run up was to just under $13 per share. At the present price of $11.75, there is a likely 10.5% upside based on this movement.  Earnings are expected hit on Feb 15th of 2023. As ET is generally considered a boring, stable, boomer company, IV on options is very low. A Feb 17th $11 call is priced $1.00 with only a $0.25 premium.  These options are well positioned to profit off of the usual run up prior to earnings.

TLDR: Buy ET stock and options for the FEB 15th earnings, to capitalize on usual stock price movement, and very possible earnings beat.

2529,wallstreetbets,"Since 8 days ago, southwest has cancelled 15,750 flights.

**Yes, flights, as in airplanes not leaving**, not individual passenger tickets but ENTIRE FLIGHTS. They are ""anticipating"" resuming ""normal travel"" ""today"". I think so far they've launched like 30 planes or something (a meaningless amount) and are still cancelling flights, but they're worried they're going to face issues AGAIN for NYE travel.

Let's break down these numbers.

Average SW flight holds 170 people
Net profit for each passenger is around $250
the profit from each plane is approx $42,500
$42,500 x 15,750 flights is $669,375,000

Ok, so Southwest just lost 670 million dollars of PROFIT in 8 days, and will potentially lost more.

But wait! It's not over. Southwest has to pay back ALL the passengers for their tickets, baggage fees, etc... but ALSO compensate them for hotel fees (some people were stranded for 6-7 days, and southwest has to pay for their hotels this entire time), lost luggage (so much lost luggage it's insane) because around 2.5 MILLION PEOPLE were affected by this.

Let's say, on average, you comp each person 600 dollars. I don't think that's unreasonable since the low end will be 300, and some people will be getting thousands in comps so I'm being generous here.

600 x 2,500,000 is 1,500,000,000.

Yes, 1.5 BILLION dollars in comps.

So Southwest, in 8 days, lost 670 million dollars in potential profit, and likely has to payout around 1.5 BILLION dollars in damages to all the passengers it fucked over.

These two numbers don't include all the maintenance fees, fuel costs, airport fees, etc and all the other costs of doing business. Not sure how to calculate those numbers, but those losses must also be huge.

Even if you are down a lot on the year if you did not sell any of those losing positions you could still have capital gains to pay from winning trades.

|Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickersFundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment‚Äôs price.I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.\&amp;nbsp;

|Things to consider when finding the plays-¬∑ If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.¬∑ If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play. (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.)¬∑ The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move.

2615,wallstreetbets,"The Federal Reserve is set to launch a new system in 2023, and one question on the minds of many is whether this system could potentially challenge the use of cryptocurrency for instant and secure transactions. In order to fully understand the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's new system, it is important to first understand the fundamental value of an investment and the difference between fundamentals and intangibles. 

One intangible aspect to consider is how the Federal Reserve may be able to replace something that cryptocurrency is designed to replace. Crypto enthusiasts may argue that the Federal Reserve's ability to manipulate the economy through measures such as printing money can create pump-and-dump cycles, which crypto aims to eliminate. Some may argue that we should stop printing money altogether, as paper currency or fiat has little inherent value. These intangibles will be discussed further in the article, but first, it is important to examine the fundamental values that underlie any investment.

The fundamental qualities of cryptocurrency that make it appealing to investors include decentralization, transparency, censorship resistance, and immutability. These features offer a level of security that traditional financial systems cannot match. Furthermore, cryptocurrency allows for quick and secure money transfers without the need for a central authority, making it an ideal option for those who want to transact without involving a third party. 

The combination of these features, along with the added benefit of providing users with a level of privacy, makes cryptocurrency a strong investment. Investors can trust that their funds are secure and their transactions are protected from potential fraud. While the Federal Reserve's new system may offer similar levels of security and speed for transactions, it lacks the decentralization and privacy offered by cryptocurrency. 

When evaluating investments, there are typically two types of value to consider: the fundamental value of how much is expected to be received in return, and the intangible value of something received. For example, if you invest $1000 and receive $100 back each year, you can expect a 10% cash on cash return. Intangible values, such as those associated with a phone upgrade, are more difficult to measure. We may be able to describe the upgrade as better, faster, or more helpful, but it is not always possible to put a numerical value on these intangible benefits. 

When considering the fundamental qualities of cryptocurrency, there are two forms of cash flow to consider: preservation and returns. Preservation of cash flow involves maintaining a stable value, similar to having digital gold. The second form of cash flow is returns, which is where Bitcoin comes into play. Bitcoin's market cap is currently worth around $327 million, which is only a fraction of gold's $12 trillion market cap. If Bitcoin were to reach the same value as gold, it could potentially be worth over $571,000 per coin. This potential value, along with other advantages, has led many to believe that Bitcoin is a more attractive option than gold. 

Unlike treasuries, it is difficult to impose sanctions on gold since nations like Japan or China can purchase U.S. Treasuries, allowing the US to freeze their assets and effectively block them from accessing their funds. While gold has its own challenges, such as being difficult to transport and costly to keep secure, it is also hard to quickly liquidate at a stable value. This is why Bitcoin is often considered a digital form of gold, as it overcomes many of these challenges while also providing immunity from sanctions, making it a viable alternative. 

Recent developments in cryptocurrency technology have sparked debate about its potential use as a hedging tool against sanctions and other risks faced by central banks. In response, Harvard University has released an article exploring this idea, titled ""Hedging Sanctions and Risk: Cryptocurrency in Central Bank Reserves"". This article offers insight into how decentralized cryptocurrencies could be used to reduce risks to the global financial system. 

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have several advantages, such as being easily transferable, relatively cheap to secure and maintain, and able to be quickly liquidated. However, their prices can be volatile, which has led to major losses for some hedge funds in the past year. The goal for many is for Bitcoin to act as digital gold, offering stability over time. 

In the world of cryptocurrency, one of the most important values is transactions. Transactions offer opportunities for fees and revenue. Many coins, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, also give their holders voting rights on the chain's activities, allowing them to benefit from any residual revenue generated through transaction fees. This means stakeholders have control over their respective blockchains and can earn rewards for participating in their operations. 

One issue with this model is the cost of transactions. Ethereum 2.0, which promises 100,000 transactions per second, currently costs around $1.56 per transaction. Meanwhile, the average cost of a Bitcoin transaction is between $1.50 and $4. This is a significant decrease from the $40 to $50 range it was a year ago, but it may also be due to lower trading volumes now that the crypto market has entered a bear phase. 

Despite the value they offer, Bitcoin and Ethereum can still be quite expensive when it comes to transactions. Many people suggest using private wallets to conduct transactions, but this comes with the risk of requiring technical knowledge to manage the wallet and keep it in cold storage. As a result, most people advise using a service like Coinbase or a tool like MetaMask, which incurs fees and may lead users to consider other options like CashApp, Zelle, Venmo, PayPal, or Revolut. 

**OK, so back to the FED plans**

The Federal Reserve is planning to launch a service called FedNow in May to June of 2023, and this service could potentially replace the need for many instantaneous and free transactions. The first release of the FedNow Service will provide basic functionality to support market needs for a variety of use cases, including popular ones such as account-to-account transfers and bill pay. Future releases of the FedNow Service will include additional features to support even more instant payment use cases. 

Therefore, the FedNow program aims to replace current market alternatives by providing transactions with close to zero fees.

However, the FedNow program will never be able to replace the core purpose of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, which is to provide an alternative to the Federal Reserve. Since the FedNow system is provided by the Federal Reserve, it cannot fully escape its centralized nature. Additionally, FedNow is not a blockchain-based product and is not a digital currency issued by a central bank. It still heavily relies on third parties to function and is limited to the borders of the United States, while cryptocurrency is a global phenomenon with over 12 billion transactions per day.

As auto industry faces an uncertain 2023, entrepreneur must take some of the blame for company‚Äôs problems
Elon Musk during the official opening of the new Tesla manufacturing plant in Germany on March 22 2022

Whether out of hubris, carelessness or just boredom with his day job, Elon Musk‚Äôs personal missteps have served as a catalyst for the decline. ¬© Christian Marquardt/Getty 

For much of this year, as other growth stocks collapsed, Tesla appeared to defy gravity. The bulls complained that shares in Elon Musk‚Äôs electric carmaker were suffering because of his offer for Twitter. But as recently as three months ago, with the stock down only 25 per cent from its November 2021 high, it was still possible to believe that it would escape the worst of the carnage.
Not anymore. A gruesome December has sliced more than 40 per cent from Tesla‚Äôs shares, leaving them two-thirds lower than their level in late September. Before a partial rebound early on Thursday, Tesla‚Äôs stock market value had dropped to $355bn, a staggering fall of nearly $900bn from its 2021 peak.
It is easy to find reasons for this sell-off at a time when growth is out of fashion on Wall Street and the auto industry is facing an uncertain 2023. But Musk himself must take some of the blame. Whether out of hubris, carelessness or just boredom with his day job, his personal missteps have served as a catalyst for the decline.

One is the mismanagement of his own outsized public persona. Musk likes to claim that his presence on Twitter has been of immeasurable value to Tesla shareholders. On the way up, he had a point. It was a megaphone that helped cement him in the public consciousness as the world‚Äôs foremost maverick entrepreneur, even if it brought unpleasant public spats and a run-in with regulators.
But as he has stoked chaos and polarisation at Twitter in the two months since the takeover, his personal brand ‚Äî and, by extension, that of Tesla ‚Äî has been tarnished.
A second misstep was to take the company‚Äôs elevated stock for granted. Turning his attention to Twitter at a moment when the auto industry seems on the brink of a downturn, and as serious competition in electric vehicles finally starts to mount, looks like seriously bad judgment, even if it turns out only to be temporary.

Musk also seems to have believed that he could treat his Tesla stock holdings like a piggy bank. He started selling two days after the stock peaked and has gone on to dispose of just under $40bn worth of his shares, continuing the sales even after he said he would stop (a comment he repeated last week). With his current stake in Tesla now worth $51.7bn, the disposals look significant.

Actions like these help to explain how the stock market spell that Musk managed to spin around himself and Tesla has been broken. And where emotion has retreated, rational analysis has stepped in to provide ample justification for a savage re-rating.

For many, it has been possible to believe that Tesla was on the brink of capturing the lion‚Äôs share of a giant new electric vehicle market that was about to open up. But as Musk warned on Twitter last week, higher interest rates and an uncertain economy point to a rough period ahead. With customer waiting lists falling sharply in Tesla‚Äôs two biggest markets, the US and China, the durability of demand has replaced supply for the first time as the uppermost concern for the company‚Äôs investors.

Tesla had already warned in October that inventory levels were likely to rise further this quarter as production outstrips deliveries, and that profit margins would be under pressure again. This month it started offering incentives of $7.500 for anyone taking delivery of a Model 3 or Model Y before the end of the year.

All this comes as Tesla gets closer to the crossroads that all growth stocks reach eventually. Sustaining the rapid expansion that Musk has promised is starting to look challenging without taking action that will eat into the profits Wall Street have now come to expect.
Over the past two years, the 30 per cent gross margin on Tesla‚Äôs automotive operations (at least, until higher costs crept in this spring) was roughly double the likes of Ford and General Motors, and comfortably above Toyota‚Äôs 19 per cent. Seeking to sustain margins could eat further into the growth stock valuation that still supports the company, even after the slide.

None of this detracts from the incredible success Tesla can point to as it ends another year of growth that other carmakers could only dream of. But a stock market value that is double Toyota and a share price at 30 times this year‚Äôs expected earnings still leaves room for further disappointment.",Musk breaks the spell he had woven around Tesla,1672393695

2646,wallstreetbets,"&gt;My original input for chat GPT - Write a story about Kris who was a degenerate options trader but got lucky with TESLA options and made millions of dollars overnight

Story written by Chat GPT AI

&amp;#x200B;

Kris was a degenerate options trader who had always lived on the edge. He was always chasing the next big win, and he didn't care how he got it. He was willing to take risks that most people wouldn't even consider, and he had lost a lot of money over the years as a result.

But Kris was nothing if not persistent. He always bounced back from his losses, and he was always on the lookout for the next big opportunity. And one day, that opportunity finally presented itself.

It was a hot summer day, and Kris was sitting in his office, staring at his computer screen. He had heard rumors that Tesla was about to announce some major news, and he was determined to get in on the action. He knew that if he could just get in early, he could make a killing.

So Kris placed a bet on Tesla options, betting that the stock was going to go up. It was a risky move, but Kris was feeling lucky. And as it turned out, he was right.

The news about Tesla was even better than anyone had expected, and the stock soared. Kris's options skyrocketed in value, and he made millions of dollars overnight. It was the biggest win of his career, and he couldn't believe his luck.

Kris was over the moon, and he couldn't wait to see what the future held. He knew that he had finally hit the jackpot, and he was eager to see what other opportunities might come his way.

But Kris's luck didn't last forever. The market was volatile, and Kris's success was short-lived. He lost most of his fortune in the following months, and he was back to square one.

But Kris didn't let his losses get him down. He knew that he had been lucky to make as much money as he did, and he was determined to keep on trading. He was a degenerate options trader at heart, and he knew that the only way to succeed was to keep on taking risks.

I started off the year with high hopes and big dreams of becoming a stock market mogul. I spent hours researching different companies, analyzing market trends, and studying different strategies. I was confident that I had the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed.

But as it turns out, I was completely wrong. My first few trades ended in massive losses and before I knew it, I was down a few thousand dollars. I tried to bounce back and make up for my losses, but every time I thought I had a surefire win, the market would turn against me and I'd end up even further in the red.

It was frustrating, to say the least. I was starting to feel like I was cursed or something. Every time I made a trade, it seemed like the universe was conspiring against me. I even started to believe that 0dte's were just out to get me.

Despite my best efforts, I just couldn't seem to catch a break. My portfolio was in shambles and I was starting to lose hope. But then, something miraculous happened. I finally made a trade that actually worked out in my favor! I was so excited, I couldn't believe it.

But alas, my luck was short-lived. The next few trades I made ended in even bigger losses than before. I was starting to think that maybe, just maybe, I wasn't cut out for this whole stock market thing.

In the end, I decided to throw in the towel and call it quits. Trading 0dte's just wasn't for me. I guess I'll stick to playing the stock market in Monopoly from now on.

2678,wallstreetbets,"Platinum open interest exceeds available inventory at NYMEX, time to buy Plat!

Quick primer:

Open interest is how many contracts are outstanding for a certain futures contract month 

First notice is the day that shorts can issue delivery notices to longs, and if you remain long on first notice day then you must put up 100% of the contract value rather than 10%, so you have to be serious about taking delivery to stay long into first notice

What just happened:

More longs are putting up the cash to take delivery in January than there is metal available currently in NYMEX warehouses

Specifically 141k ounces worth of longs to 135k ounces worth of inventory. Even worse for shorts is that only 79k of that 135k is ‚Äúregistered‚Äù meaning readily available to be delivered into those contracts.

This means shorts will need to buy their way out of a big chunk of these contracts or move metal in from elsewhere

This was likely happening today in part as the price of platinum surged 5%.

Inventories are quite strained currently, as NYMEX warehouses have gone from over 800k in early 2021 to only 135k now.


My positions:

I own physical platinum, PPLT, IMPUY, ANGPY, and a small amount of calls

PPLT and physical are the biggest piece of my exposure though

Highly recommend getting some exposure to platinum!

2680,wallstreetbets,"I'm going to take some time off Reddit &amp; other social media + from being super active in the market. I'm doing very poorly in school, and my mental &amp; physical health has deteriorated with my obsession with making money and watching the market 10 hours a day. It has paid off so far, but there is more to life than just money. Let me share some of my thoughts before I take a break.

Current positioning across all 7 accounts:

\~250k $ASTS shares long.

524 shares short $CAT.

\~6000 shares short $NVDA.

I am currently using margin.

**Quick Highlights:**

**For $ASTS long:** AST Spacemobile wants to provide cellular broadband connectivity to the entire world. There are billions of people worldwide who don't have reliable access to the internet, and AST wants to close the digital divide through its patented technology. They will have little to no customer acquisition costs and are strategically partnered with AT&amp;T, Vodafone, Nokia, American Tower, Rakuten, etc. I personally believe that it provides one of the most asymmetrical r / r on the long side of the market right now. There is a chance that the stock goes to 0 if the tech/funding does not work as planned, but if the tech/funding works as planned, a 100x+ is possible (run your own DCF model). The tech has been partially validated through BW1 (cell phone in orbit) and BW2 (antenna on the ground), and also their strategic partners have done extensive DD on them. Full validation of technology is currently set to be completed in the coming months. There are also funding risks, but there is the possibility that the Rural 5g Fund and their strategic partners might close the current funding gap. This is a high-risk potentially high-reward play so only risk what you can afford to lose. There might be some risks that I am unaware of. Do your own DD.

**This is both a trade and an investment for me.**

Here is some more extensive DD

[https://transhumanica.com/asts](https://transhumanica.com/asts)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/q6tqw8/ast\_spacemobile\_the\_starlink\_of\_smartphones/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/q6tqw8/ast_spacemobile_the_starlink_of_smartphones/)

**For $NVDA short:**  A lot of demand was pulled forward during COVID in the semiconductor industry. There's geopolitical risk. Sales are slowing. Insane P/E in a risk-off environment. It's still priced like a hypergrowth stock when it's already one of the largest companies in the world. Margin compressions. Supply chain issues. The growth story is dead right now, and the current market is just unforgiving. Etc. Etc. Etc. I don't think these factors are fully priced in yet. And the rally from recent lows was just insanity. I'm not going to give a PT, but I'm still holding my short at the given moment. I personally think we see much lower, but the market can stay irrational longer than we can stay solvent.

**For $CAT short:** Pretty simple thesis: It's a cyclical business and we're entering a recession. + Risk-free rate has changed. No reason it should be up \~50% from the yearly lows and trading at/near all-time highs in this type of environment. I don't believe the growth story here. Construction should slow down worldwide as the recession hits, and assets will be repriced with the change in the risk-free rate.

One of my theories that Jeremy Grantham shares are that not all sectors/stocks will fall at the same time. They fall in a staggered fashion. This will let us rotate our shorts around and keep compounding gains if you can get the timing down right.

Let me share another interesting thing (\*wink-wink\*): Look at the Dow, and the individual stocks that make up the index. There are a lot of institutions hiding there, and a lot of the recent moves in those individual stocks do not make sense in this risk-off environment. I'm looking at you $CAT (there are a bunch more).

Be careful of bear market rallies, inflation coming roaring back (look at history), earnings recession etc. Stay rooted in reality.

I will be active till the new year, and I am not sure when I will be back.

None of this is financial advice, and without notice, and at any given moment, I can open new positions and close any position that I may have. I might also change my mind on how I view these companies and the broader market. As always, do your own DD, and never risk what you cannot tolerate losing. Love you all, and wish you all the best. ‚ù§Ô∏è",My thoughts before I take a break.,1672381625

I got into trading back in 2020 and saw incredible gains. It seemed very easy at the time and my confidence grew. Even with COVID grinding the world economy to a halt, my share prices kept going up. Most of my investments were in tech and at one stage I was almost 200% up! I did take some profit and should have left it at that, but then I decided to dip back in and tried my hand at ‚Äúpenny stocks‚Äù. Unfortunately I have a job that required 100% of my attention for several weeks at a time. I saw my stocks rising high again and then foolishly didn‚Äôt see the dips and crashes coming. By the time I gave it my full attention I was down several thousand‚Ä¶ I decided to leave it and wait for it to bounce back! Needless to say that did not happen.

The American Consumer is nearly tapped out of all savings, credit card debt has been on a strong increase the past few months. The warning signs are everywhere if you really look. Now that we're passed the the holiday season, three major things will happen:

1- American consumption spending will fall off a Cliff. They are tapped out, credit cards are nearly maxed out. Ask me, I know :( 

&amp;#x200B;

2-Layoffs layoffs and more layoffs. As of November, unemployment rate is 3.7%. A lot of companies don't like to layoff during Thanksgiving and Christmas season. Google has been reluctant to layoff a significant portion of their staff...Expect Google to cut at least 3-8% off their workforce. Some friends in healthcare and other industries, especially in the discretionary spending sector are all Saying they will will let a great number of blue collar workers off in the coming months. Consumers won't and can't spend, no need for companies to be fully staffed. I'm expecting unemployment to hit 5-0% to 5.75% in 2023. 

&amp;#x200B;

3- Housing market and rental prices will see a significant decrease. Overall Inflation will drop significantly after February. Great news right? No, not necessarily. See reason 1 &amp; 2. Things will get ugly out there. For those older Millennial's, ask them if they remember 2008-2012 in the real world, where are the good jobs? 

&amp;#x200B;

\-As for the stock market, expect a major selloff in the coming 20-35 trading days. Earnings season will be bad in for Q4 2022 and much worse for Q1/Q2 2023. 

Jan-October will be ugly in the real world. Really nothing the feds can do to stop the economy and jobs from vomiting and shedding workforce. We just gotta ride this tidal wave coming at us...2024 should be a much better year for stocks and jobs.

# Palantir $PLTR on a subscription model:

I‚Äôm using the similar model to value Palantir similar the one introduced in my write-up on Peloton ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zu0lrg/pton\_an\_updated\_valuation\_and\_market\_narrative/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zu0lrg/pton_an_updated_valuation_and_market_narrative/)).

While I fully recognize it‚Äôs far from an identical structure, it has the two ingredients necessary: the promise of new customers and fees from ongoing services. The approach has advantages over the FCF method of valuation as initial margins are negative, but the value of bringing on new customers outweighs the spending over time. Since the companies‚Äô service is AI software, once an organization implements it, the company sees its value and they tend to renew.

Palantir has both government and commercial clients and they have used their products to assist in the production of the A350, combating the rise of ISIS operations in Europe, evacuating people from Afghanistan, assisting with vaccine testing and rollout, money laundering for banks, wildfire risks, minimizing flight delays for the FAA, just to name a few. The applications are endless and the investor presentations always mention their TAM across industries. This (along with a fat gross margin of 80%) was why the company was once so hyped, but market forces have caught up with the share price. This post will cover the value of Palantir‚Äôs existing customer base, value of new customers and the value of other operating cash flows.

&amp;#x200B;

# Government Business

Revenues from government have been hovering at of 55% Palantir‚Äôs business over the last 3 years. The breakdown is given in company‚Äôs financial reporting. Over half of this is from the US, 11% from UK, 6%, from France, and the rest of the world is responsible for about 30%. With 109 different government customers, the average agency is spending $8.9M annually. Gross margins are consistently hovering around 80% and I assumed that 40% of R&amp;D spending and 20% of marketing spending are allocated to maintaining the services. Palantir boasts a metric called Net Dollar Retention upwards of 140% in the earnings presentations ‚Äì this is essentially year over year revenues from a single customer. I took this to inform my revenue growth rates of 7% annually. Government churn have been zero since going public, but 1% (losing 1-2 agencies per year) seemed reasonable until 2030 as government initiatives change. If things keep chugging along with existing customers they have PV of $9.1B.

[Value of Existing Gov Customer Base](https://preview.redd.it/9gzpzawqcx8a1.png?width=1115&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dbdd99fbd33b1812a56b92d2cd1a7f35810a02e0)

The rest of the government marketing and R&amp;D expenses go to the acquisition of new customers, and that came out to a spend of $9.7M each as they went from 90 to 109 customers. Landing contracts may be difficult, so gross new subscriber rate was kept at a modest rate ‚Äì 4% to make an expansion to 133 customers by 2030 and a total government revenue of $1.6B, 60% total growth over the next 7 years. The value add of the potential government revenues comes to $4.1B.

# Commercial Business

The commercial business represents the other 45% of Palantir‚Äôs revenue but here is where there is much more potential growth. With growth comes more customer churn and a lower revenue per customer. Average customer revenue is $3.9M, with an operating margin of nearly 60% per customer. While they also claim that they have a 100% renewal rate, I‚Äôm certain that some of their customers are funded by Palantir‚Äôs own SPAC Investments and will not remain solvent‚Äîtherefore churn was slightly higher at 2% ([https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantirs-spac-bets-backfire-hitting-companys-growth-11671511333](https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantirs-spac-bets-backfire-hitting-companys-growth-11671511333)).

The value of Palantir‚Äôs existing customers comes to $6.1B.

[Value of existing commercial customers](https://preview.redd.it/fuo656uycx8a1.png?width=1115&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26e73f0f37802e7379192d54c475e7433b08d302)

Acquiring a new commercial customer costs $3.4M and I projected 10% yearly growth in the number of customers ‚Äì360 by 2030 which would imply about 3/5 of the S&amp;P 500 and those with the amount of data to make sense to implement Palantir‚Äôs products. Implied annual revenue from commercial clients by the end of my projections are $2.2B, almost a 3x of what they are projected to close out 2022 with. The value of new commercial customers comes to $8.4B.

# Valuing Share Price

I also added drag of the corporate overhead since G&amp;A expenses are not allocated to either acquiring or maintaining existing customers. These grow at 5% per year as revenue expands by 2.5x driven by Sales and Marketing + R&amp;D expenses

Summing it all up and dividing out I get to $9.20 per share while its currently bouncing around $6.50.

https://preview.redd.it/dmcdqw3ydx8a1.png?width=578&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3e7dde9230497d9339db7d89ffd08c3b63b00a7

While I could run sensitivities anywhere, I think that the main drivers of the future share price will be the discount rate and growth rate in commercial customers. I assumed 10% growth in the $9.20 price, but 15% growth rate implies that the entire S&amp;P 500 plus a few others would be customers of Palantir, plus a few others‚Äîa bit of a stretch by 2030 in my opinion.

# CAPM and Other Notes

* $PLTR has a market equity beta of 2.9. The CAPM implies an eye watering 20% discount rate (2.89\*MRP + 3.5% risk free rate). I used a discount rate of 12% which seems more reasonable given the client base with deep pockets. I believe my growth estimates are conservative enough to account for the risks, but you can see from the sensitivity how much it compresses the value.
* Contracts: for this approach, I assumed an average contract size per customer. In reality, there are a few large contracts and the rest are smaller. I could break it down more by going through their 10Q presentations and get more granular but who knows if that would actually add value to this analysis.
* Customer Acquisition Costs: If you invest $50M into a company via SPAC offering and then you gain them as a customer, that doesn‚Äôt show up in your income statement and it all looks fine from this standpoint. I don‚Äôt expect this to continue but there could be more write downs in value of their marketable securities.

I appreciate you for making it to the end of this write up. It was an interesting study, and I hope to keep this updated in the future as the story unfolds. There is definitely space to improve upon this but I wanted to post this before the new year and would appreciate comments.

If that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, they‚Äôre capping prices to get people home, which means they‚Äôre selling tickets at a loss (or at least lower than they would normally expect to make during the busiest season of the year)

What are your thoughts on going into the first half of 2023 in VSCA.

Total movement wise was $1.2 of total movement from peak to trough over 4.25 hours of trading. Absolutely brutal. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5r350rz1vw8a1.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4032f3bedb496c5f877b117fba636c747d3d3046

Tomorrow is the Quarterly options expiration and is also when we will finally see the JPM collar rotated. 

A little interesting data about the quarterly expiration day‚Ä¶ this is the first (presumably unless we have a wild -12% day haha) on SPY that we have closed closer to the Calls then the puts. We actually here at market close are sitting $2 from the 3870 calls. (note- originally the JPM collar was at 3870) but it appears looking at the OI for tomorrow the call are actually at 3835 with 60k of calls‚Ä¶. 3400P with 42.6k and 2860P with 41.8k)

But if we look at the trends here of the last 4 quarterly options expiration there is actually not a single quarterly in the last four that has opened green‚Ä¶ the last 4 quarterlies have opened red and averaged a -1% open. 

Also interesting to note is that the first trading day after quarterly has opened green 3 out of 4 times averaging a 0.58% green open. 

A few things to note about the quarterly days too is that most besides the June quarterly have closed lower than its opening price‚Ä¶ remember June was when we were sitting between the put strikes too. 

September 30th- 1.6% rally at open followed by a 2.4% total drop from 115am till EOD. 1% total drop during the last 30 minutes of trading.

June 30th- 1.2% drop at open -&gt; 2.2% rally till 1pm -&gt; 1.45 drop from 1pm till 330pm -&gt; 0.9% drop last 30 minutes. 

March 31st- 0.5% rally until 1030 -&gt; 1.7% drop from 1030 until EOD -&gt; 1.34% drop during the last 30 minutes. 

That means we are averaging about a 1.1% rally from the morning low to the HOD. After that we are averaging a 2.1% drop into the EOD and the last 30 minutes of trading is averaging a 0.98% drop by itself. 

The one caveat here would be that this is the first time we have closed the day before over the call side of the collar. In theory I would think all that call OI coming off the books would lead to a bigger drop through the day. But this is going to be a new trend to watch for sure tomorrow. The last two months have showed us what has worked before is not always going to work in this market. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6g661qq2vw8a1.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=757dcedccc7825434226ca215a784aed81f8109a

Something interesting to note is that over night the CBOE equities put/ call ratio had a massive (record breaking) spike in the put call ratio‚Ä¶ it hit 2.4 which is apparently a record for it. The last time this happened was on December 21st which also was a record breaking spike for it. 

If you remember December 21st was very similar in that we were in a very big breakdown pattern and had clear momentum to break through 378, however, we had a huge spike that very next day in the CBOE equities put call ratio and that resulted in a huge gap up and a big 1.5% green day‚Ä¶ The very nice day SPY put in a red -1.43% day, however, at one point was down over 3%. That was the day where we had some extreme bear momentum and had touched 375 area and had an impressive EOD rally to close back in that 380 area. A 2-3% red close would put us near 371-375.

With what I mentioned above about the quarterly trend AND what happened last time we had a huge spike in CBOE put call ratios‚Ä¶ it is very possible we COULD see a breakdown tomorrow. EOD and really after 1145am today showed a lot of weakness in SPY and we could not break through that wall at 383.9. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zw6fqsc3vw8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8603cead0f668105bfafb43cdcda659336a5fa98

 Taking a loo k at the SPY daily here. You can see that the blue bear channel we were trading in has now been broken and we are actually establishing a red support line. With that break down and closure under 378 yesterday that should have caused a continuation down, however, the buy pressure and volume today was absolutely insane. Not quite sure where all the buy pressure came from. 

So now taking a look at the daily it appears we are actually trading back inside of that 379.6 to 386.4 consolidation range. There actually really is a tighter 383.5 to 379.6 range that has no over the last 8 trading days only had 2 candles close outside of it. 

With spy closing over its daily 8ema for the first time since December 14th this should provide some upside. I would personally like to see us close over 386.6 minimally before I expect any bigger push. However, if we happened to get a huge green day (1.8%) and closed over 390.1 then I would feel even more confident in a push to the 400s next week and we actually COULD see a ‚Äúsanta rally.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Its not perfect‚Ä¶ but there actually is a nice inverted head and shoulder forming here on the zoomed out daily chart on spy‚Ä¶ IF this plays out correctly then that really could be a huge push for us to 410-420 area. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/02hfgnd4vw8a1.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a185beaea0de0fb9a653e4d6f3cd4c8d1a89c823

Keeping that in mind we actually could see a ‚Äúshort peak‚Äù put in near 390 before we see our next leg down. Trend wise this year we have seen a short peak put in BEFORE we get the next leg down. The last two weekly candles (if we closed here) are also reversal dojis which do provide upside for next week. 

Key support- 379.6 -&gt; 378 -&gt; 376.6

Key resistance- 386.3 -&gt; 388 -&gt; 390.2

Futures shows that consolidation channel a little better. I did mention overnight we could get that 3805 double bottom and that would be the bulls last defense. They took it seriously and gave us a massive bounce overnight with this daily candle not even fully touching 3805. 

Futures remain in a 3805 to 3920 consolidation channel. 3845 was previous support of that consolidation channel and there is a more major resistance line still at 3975 which we did fail to break over and close over today. On futures we actually did NOT close over the daily 8ema and actually saw a rejection at that 3870 level of the daily 8ema. 

An EOW closure under 3805 would make me bearish‚Ä¶ and a closure over 3920 would make me bullish. 

Support- 3845 -&gt; 3805 -&gt; 3750

Resistance- 3870 -&gt; 3920

Currently cycle wise we are at day 2 of the bounce and currently at 14.2%. now this was nearly double the drop and nearly double the previous average drop also‚Ä¶ so we could be looking at a 4 day 28% pop‚Ä¶ that would put tesla at the 136 to 139 range before it sees a rejection. 

This actually would get tesla back to its daily 20ema which is historically when it sees a rejection. 

Key support- 117.5 -&gt; 113 -&gt; 108.9

Key resistance- 126.4 -&gt; 135.9

The VIX is holding its support line. Despite that huge PC ratio on CBOE equities we did not get much of a VIX movement. We actually look very similar to December 21st which you can see the day AFTER that we had that massive 20% spike on the VIX. That 20% spike is what caused the huge 3% drop on SPY‚Ä¶ expect we saw a huge intraday reversal that gave back 50%+ of the drop. 

As you can see we are in that bear channel but we are actually forming a nice breakout triangle here too‚Ä¶ a drop under 21.6 tomorrow could confirm the upside move is coming that I mentioned. However, if we open and push green here that move might have to wait until next week.

Not a great day for me here today. I played the overnight put swing however we obviously had that unexpected PC spike and had a huge green open. I was actually a little surprised at the puts having any value left in them at open. 

I played a potential reversal on SPY early in the morning that was clearly not a fake breakdown. I recognized early today the extreme bull momentum we had on SPY and how aggressively VOLD was pushing. However, I just couldn‚Äôt based on my indicators find an entry I liked or wanted to take. 

Days like today are very very tough to play. When you have rules to enter a trade and those rules never show an entry but had you broken your rules and just ‚Äútaken it anyways‚Äù you woulda taken a win is hard to digest. However, if 2022 bear market has taught me anything‚Ä¶ its that we NEVER break out rules for one or two trading days that are the exception. 

Really outside of my swing play that was a loss today was just a small red day. The red swing makes it feel worse than it was. 

For me and I have said this all of 2022‚Ä¶ we need to be picky on the trades we make and we need to be preserving capital for whenever we return to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù market‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt mean a bull market I mean a normal market. 2022 has been anything but normal and honestly‚Ä¶ 2023 does not look much better at all‚Ä¶

In a interview with CNBC, Jamie Dimon, CEO of Chase Bank, shared that consumers are currently spending 40% more than before the COVID-19 pandemic. He also mentioned that households still have an additional $1 trillion in their checking and savings accounts. Furthermore, Dimon stated that spending on Black Friday and throughout the year has increased by 10% compared to the previous year

It is worth noting that inflation has reached 10%, so in real terms, it is possible that spending has not actually increased by 10%. :)

In his interview, Jamie Dimon provided two warnings. The first warning was that he expects consumers to run out of their excess savings by the middle of 2023, which could lead to a mild to hard recession.

**It is important to understand that consumer spending drives 70% of the economy**. Therefore, if consumers stop spending, it is likely that GDP will go negative and growth will also decline year over year. **This could also cause a decrease in earnings per share at companies, potentially leading to a crash in the stock market.**

**In the event of a market crash, the first half would likely be a multiple crush, where the value of future earnings is discounted at a higher rate. This would lead to a decrease in the value of stocks, potentially resulting in significant losses for investors. While this explanation may be simplified, the consequences of such a crash would be significant and painful. It is important for both consumers and investors to be aware of the potential risks and take steps to prepare for them.**

**If a recession were to occur in Q3 or Q4 of 2023, it would align with the expected peak of the Fed funds rate and with the potential for an inverted yield curve, which is often considered a sign of an impending recession.**

Many people **believe that the economy was already in a recession in Q1 and Q2 of 2022** due to **negative GDP growth**. However, it is possible that these numbers could be revised upwards in the future, and it is generally difficult to determine whether or not a recession has occurred until a year or more after it has begun. **Therefore, basing investment decisions on the assumption that a recession is currently happening or will happen soon can be risky.**

**Jamie Dimon's warning** was not so much about the potential for a recession, but rather the **consequences of the actions taken by the Federal Reserve to address inflation**. It is known that the Fed's plan has been to use interest rate hikes and other measures to stamp out inflation, but they have not been particularly transparent about their intentions. This lack of transparency, combined with the potential for a recession, could have **significant consequences for the economy and for investors.**

**Dimon's second warning was that,** in the lifetimes of most people, the **US has never experienced a QT cycle** (Quantitative tightening - monetary policies that contract, or reduce, the Federal Reserve System (Fed) balance sheet ). While there has been some QT in the past, **Dimon believes that the full effects of such a cycle are unknown.** He warned that the **QT cycle could keep rates high even as the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates. This could create a ""bizarre world"" where the Fed is simultaneously cutting rates and ramping up QT to keep rates high.**

Overall, Dimon believes that the US is entering a period of significant economic uncertainty. **He urged investors to be cautious and to consider investing in companies with strong purchasing power and expanding margins.**

**In conclusion**, if you need the money invested in the stock market or crypto in the near to medium term (6-8 months to 2-3 years), it is difficult to predict what will happen. **However, by carefully monitoring market movements and positioning ourselves as best as possible, we can prepare for potential challenges and opportunities.**",CEO of Chase Bank - Households $1 trillion in their checking and savings accounts,1672340959

Exploring the FED's Thought Process

In 2019, the Federal Reserve announced a new policy called Flexible Average Inflation Targeting targeting, also known as (FAIT). This policy states that the Fed aims for inflation to average 2% over the long term, rather than maintaining a strict 2% inflation rate at all times.

The target is measured using headline PCE inflation, which was slightly below the target before the pandemic. This policy shift is interesting because it allows for some flexibility in terms of inflation rates and takes into account the length of time that inflation has been below 2% before making decisions on rates.

This means that the Federal Reserve is taking a 10-20 year period and calculating the average based on the PCE inflation rate

So if we make an average of PCE inflation we going to have the following numbers

Average Inflation 

https://preview.redd.it/69qt5bl0tv8a1.png?width=309&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdd35986d6491dc4992005ab21dc59ac1fb90a11

We can see from 2010 and 2020 the average is below 2% according to the graph so I think FED will want to try to average the 2010-2030 period. And if we put the Fed estimates number in play the average inflation should look like this.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ws43b5e6tv8a1.png?width=411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cddafd899f1d7885160ab8e68a54dc9721d16b1d

 

As the market continues to fluctuate, some investors are concerned about the possibility of returning to the 2% inflation target. They fear that the Federal Reserve will take actions that will harm the economy . As a result, these investors are hesitant to invest in the market until the Fed changes its policy on inflation. However,. When Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, was asked about the possibility of **raising the inflation target above 2%, he responded that there was no consideration of doing so**. **This suggests that the Fed will continue to talk down inflation in public statements, but their written policy allows for an average inflation rate over time.**

**So while it may be tempting to panic about the potential for the Fed to crush the economy, it's important to remember that their written policy allows for flexibility in achieving the inflation target.** **We had a period of lower inflation, and now we are experiencing higher inflation. If we have lower inflation in the future, that's okay because the policy allows for an average inflation rate over time.**

In my opinion, the market can remain very bullish**. I don't want to be misunderstood as suggesting that this is the time to go all in on investments. Rather, my goal is to show that even though investors may be pessimistic and waiting for the Fed to change their inflation target, they actually do not need to do it.**

 

**Historically, the best time to invest is when the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates, not just when they pause or reduce the rate of increases.**

**This was an interesting finding, and I'd love to hear your thoughts.**

2973,wallstreetbets," As an algorithmic trader that codes in Python, I thought I'd share my experiences on the available choices out there for API trading of US equities. Since my trading algorithms fall under the category of automated, high-frequency trading, my absolute requirements for the platform are:

1. Trading of US Stocks (NYSE, NASDAQ)
2. Zero-Commission equity trades
3. API trading enabled
4. No re-authentication required for at least 30 days

Not required, but heavily preferred:

1. Fractional trading
2. Free NBBO Quotes
3. Options trading

I investigated 9 brokerage firms and here's my report below:

Ally - Opened an account and API was easy to use. However, quotes from the API calls were 15 minutes delayed and later customer support directed me to a page on their website which explicitly states that no Automated or Algorithmic Trading is allowed, so I closed the account.

Robinhood - Requires you to renew token at least once a day, so I didn't bother going any further.

TD Ameritrade - Opened an account, but when I tried to request an API key, it states that new accounts requesting API trading are discontinued due to acquisition from Schwab. Will close account and wait to see how the integration with Schwab goes.

E-trade - Opened an account long time ago and API was easy to use, but it requires you to manually re-authenticate and renew token daily.

Webull - In process of opening an account. Their API documentation appears thorough. A hack with Google Chrome's Inspect mode is required to retrieve access and refresh tokens in order to bypass daily reauthentication of your tokens, but I haven't verified this yet.

Interactive Brokers - I've had an account with them for 3 years. Zero commissions on equity trades, they support fractional trades, and options trading. However, all trades must go through their TWS software (daily re-authentication) or you need to have an active gateway session opened. Their free quotes were NBBO quotes.

TradeStation - Opened an account and they informed me that they will send me an API key when my account reaches 10k in value. My equities and cash are all at this time in other exchanges and I haven't done any transfers, so I haven't received API keys yet. API documentation is thorough and similar in quality to Tradier and Alpaca. Zero commissins on equities, but they do not appear to support fractional trades. Overall, seems promising and may have potential to be better than Tradier.

Tradier - Opened an account and API was easy to use. Zero commissions. Consumer and token keys never expire. Their free quotes are NBBO. Only drawback is that they do not allow fractional trades for individual accounts, just institutional accounts. They have options trading. I'm very happy with them.

Alpaca - This is the platform I have been running algorithmic trades on for the last 2 years. Zero commissions and they allow fractional trades. Only drawback are their free quotes. They only supply you quotes from one of the exchanges (IEX) and I found the bid-ask spreads to be pretty wide and unreliable at times. You need to pay $99/month for their premium quote service. However, their real-time get\_latest\_trade API call is accurate and I use that in conjunction with their get\_latest\_quote API call, so the two combined is good enough for my algorithmic trading. This platform is my benchmark when comparing other brokerages.

Overall, I like Tradier and TradeStation the best. However, if my algorithm requires fractional trades then Alpaca is my go-to platform. Have you guys had similar experiences?

2992,wallstreetbets,"Venator is chemical company mainly engaged in Tio2 production business and is currently trading at 0.5 USD with market capitalizatin of 56 millions $. The company made over 2.2 billions in turnover last year. The problem is its debt which is about 800 million now. 

The company is owned by two main shareholders, SK capital partners owning 40% and J&amp;T owning 13%. The rest is free float. The first debt tranche is repayble on 2024.

There are several catalysts:

\- SK makes a portfolio of chemical companies which it buys in total. They bought 40% of VNTR for 2.3$, they can buy another 10% through option on June 23. SK is acting usually as an active investor, they should not let the company to go bankrupt. They create big group of diversified chemical companies, they had around 5.5billion $ AUM and VNTR is the exact type of the company they are acquiring

\- J&amp;T are venture capitalists from Czech republic. Their average purchase price is about 1.8$. They are big and strong Czechoslovak banking group which invests opportunistically. They own enough to stop SK from any harming steps, if they would want to take those 

\- VNTR currently sold part of its non-key business for 140 million $ and those will be paid in 1q of 2023 which will be used for debt repayments

2996,wallstreetbets,"It was a brutal year for mega-cap tech stocks across the board. But 2022 was especially rough for Amazon.

Shares of the e-retailer are wrapping up their worst year since the dot-com crash. The stock has tumbled 51% in 2022, marking the biggest decline since 2000, when it plunged 80%. Only Tesla, down 68%, and Meta, off 66%, have had a worse year among the most valuable tech companies.

Amazon‚Äôs market cap has shrunk to about $834 billion from $1.7 trillion to start the year. The company fell out of the trillion-dollar club last month.

Much of Amazon‚Äôs misfortunes are tied to the economy and macro environment. Soaring inflation and rising interest rates have pushed investors away from growth and into companies with high profit margins, consistent cash flow and high dividend yields.

But Amazon investors have had other reasons to exit the stock. The company is contending with slowing sales, as predictions of a sustained post-Covid e-commerce boom didn‚Äôt pan out. At the height of the pandemic, consumers came to depend on online retailers like Amazon for goods ranging from toilet paper and face masks to patio furniture. That drove Amazon‚Äôs stock to record highs as sales soared.

As the economy reopened, consumers gradually returned to shopping in stores and spending on things like travel and restaurants, which caused Amazon‚Äôs impressive revenue growth to fade. The situation only worsened at the start of this year, as the company confronted higher costs tied to inflation, the war in Ukraine and supply chain constraints.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who succeeded founder Jeff Bezos at the helm in July 2021, admitted that the company hired too many workers and overbuilt its warehouse network as it raced to keep up with pandemic-era demand. It‚Äôs since paused or abandoned plans to open some new facilities, and its head count shrank in the second quarter.

I had been teaching for a bit over six years when I decided to change my occupation. Don't get me wrong, I loved teaching, but my real dream was to be financially independent and trade full-time. So, I shopped around the internet in search of trades to take. I spent time on youtube, and learned a lot about identifying set ups, option greeks, theta, momentum, etc. I found it interesting how I was following the same ‚Äústrategies‚Äù as others, but they were profitable and I was bleeding. In an attempt for relief I sought out a platform where I could receive trade alerts, and personalized guidance. I wanted profitable trades, and someone to answer my many questions.

IDENTIFYING A GROUP¬†¬†

I didn't know where to start, so I created a paper trading account and joined all of the popular trading groups one by one. Most of the groups sent trades late, when they were no longer executable, or were being run by ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù who were in no way vetted or qualified. However I knew I found a winner 5 days into my week trial at Primetime Trading Group , I got clear timely entry and exit alerts on stocks, options, and spreads, as well as access a Superior web of analysts who took the time to explain things to me so I could understand what i needed to do to move my account forward.

FINDING SUCCESS

With time, and after a couple private sessions I became more familiar with what to look for in trades, and how to control my emotions and always get out ahead of my peers.

3027,wallstreetbets,"**TLDR;** Insurance companies are investment banks at their core. They take premiums earned and invest that capital in securities, stock, and debt. This model works because the likelihood of paying out on a policy is relatively small. However, they must still keep capital on hand in the event that lawsuits, unexpected events, or catastrophes occur. Progressive is currently incurring significant losses on existing investments while simultaneously reeling from natural disaster claims.

**SUMMARY:**

Historically speaking, many insurance companies have been consistent safe havens for investors to park their cash. This is because insurance companies don't face the complex macroeconomic constraints that come with selling a tangible product. There are no manufacturing costs, shipping fees, or commercial real-estate costs for brick-and-mortar stores. They usually only offer an intangible contract of insurance for consumers, and typically don't even frequently have to pay out on the policy.

However, they don't simply just take the premium you pay to insure your car or home and sit on it; they **reinvest it in other assets like bonds, government securities, and MBS.** This is where they make the shift from an insurance company to an investment bank. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Investment Portfolio as of September 30, 2022. US gov Obligations make up 42.8&amp;#37; at a \~$1.9B loss with Corp Debt Securities at a $833M loss.](https://preview.redd.it/9f3z41qsku8a1.png?width=1865&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a266ec688b4b01b4e6dc7f0b0309d818a897805a)

&amp;#x200B;

[Net losses of \~$7B with fixed maturity assets leading the way.](https://preview.redd.it/yqdqp3zalu8a1.png?width=1862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=525b33c2b376e22ff406eb3265d4f8108ce439f7)

Now of course these numbers look bad, but for the sake of due diligence, we have to consider more than just losses on portfolio investments for a set quarter to determine a company's solvency and feasibility as an investment. A company can perpetually stay billions of dollars in debt, yet remain above water for years. As a matter of fact, the majority of companies are. 

***So then what should be the red flags to look out for if billions of dollars in losses aren't enough?***

As I mentioned before, debt and/or loss across a period aren't necessarily a cause for concern. Over the past two years, there actually hasn't been much that has raised investors' red flags. Now that macroeconomic conditions are shifting, value and balance sheets are slowly becoming relevant again. So let's take a look.

&amp;#x200B;

[Progressive nets 1.8&amp;#37; of revenue from \~$49B in revenue. ](https://preview.redd.it/47vi4asjru8a1.png?width=1482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c36ba1df7f3af6f6fd77cd33bf6fd9451d11f9b5)

I've highlighted the information that I immediately look for when I pull up a chart. Is the company making a profit? Is the Price-to-Earnings ratio reasonable? Does the volume profile indicate that a small dollar volume could be manipulating the price?

Here we can see

1.) Net income to revenue suggests that PGR is not efficiently generating capital from operations.

2.) Price-to-Earnings ratio is abnormally high suggesting that PGR is not valued appropriately

3.) A small volume indicates that a small amount of share purchases can manipulate the stock price to the upside.

These are all red flags that in the past few years could be ignored, but are rapidly regaining relevance as investing capital sparingly in companies that reflect value back to the investor becomes a necessity.

***But I digress.***

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gr1l7y78vu8a1.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9082125155e2ae4a5828a6c7d5ffc45cf651762

Digging deeper into the vacuum of capital that makes up an insurance company's balance sheet, we can see that Progressive has a net cash position of $365M. Their net debt greatly outweighs the amount of quickly accessible cash on hand, but this could be long-term debt that is not rapidly approaching maturity.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rxoyt40kwu8a1.png?width=498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86ad44e56093bd53cb0ba387bea582257d3687e8

Another metric that can be useful is shown above. Here we can see that there are 587M shares outstanding, and 86% of those are owned by institutions. An average daily volume of \~2.5m shares suggests that many institutions have been buying and holding shares for long-term investing, driving the price up as they go. The beta of PGR is 0.46 indicating that overall, PGR is a low-volatility stock with consistent upward momentum.

**But is it a good value?**

Although the stock price action has been relatively consistent over time, a number of variables could quickly shift sentiment. If any institution that owns a large block of shares is forced/decides to liquidate for any reason, the large increase in volume to the downside would significantly shift momentum since it is not an incredibly liquid stock.

Progressive's investments may incur significant losses, further increasing risk. This is especially true for their security holdings profile.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Further volatility in the housing market or treasury securities may exponentially compound losses](https://preview.redd.it/9ua9o4dxzu8a1.png?width=1882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a07d801fe08359a4c3ae20b1f9cd88b5521b012)

Progressive operates in the industry of insurance, but with a majority of its earnings reinvested into securities and equity markets, a bulk of its profitability depends on its investments. It is an investment bank at its core, and I believe that it is not appropriately valued as such. 

https://preview.redd.it/2n66n4du0v8a1.png?width=1480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38fad4f7c496fb6e6d361d6fa339a72b7594e893

The value of the stock is increasing, yet the put/call open interest ratio is not tracking. 

**I do not necessarily believe that Progressive is plummeting toward insolvency, there may be significant value to be found here. Put option contracts are abnormally cheap for the risk involved in the industry during macroeconomic conditions such as this.**

It's difficult to find value in options nowadays, but I've noticed that some options expiring even a YEAR from January are still trading in the money for a fraction of the cost of other put options with similar expiries. This comes with the risk of a lower open interest, but only until institutions come to the same conclusion.

**Background:**

Qurate Retail owns Home Shopping Network and QVC. They've historically had a pretty strong business, generating \~$500M/year earnings with good free cash flow for over 10 years.

Qurate common stock (QRTEA) has a market cap of \~$600M right now, meaning the market thinks the company is going bankrupt (common stock will go to zero in this case). They had a huge fire recently, have a ton of debt, and their business is probably in long-term decline.

Macro Axis thinks the market implies [50% chance of bankruptcy](https://www.macroaxis.com/invest/ratio/QRTEA/Probability-Of-Bankruptcy) ... Let's round up to 60%.

**Expected Value of Bet**:

If the company does NOT go bankrupt it will probably bounce back up to its historic valuations (between $2 and $4 billion market cap). Let's say it bounces back to $4 ($1.5 billion market cap) if the business avoids bankruptcy.

Possible outcomes:  
1) QRTEA zeroes out or bounces around zero (60% chance, return of -100%)

2) QRTEA goes from $1.5 -&gt; $4 / share (40% chance, return of 400% from options)

Leverage from Call option will increase this to about 4-5x (call it 4x).

Expected value: (60%) x (-100%) + (40%) x (+400%) = +100%

Since expected value here is positive I'm betting $6000 on the outcome.

**Emotional Aspects**

3069,wallstreetbets,"My brother and I were planning on visiting Ohio from Florida in order to see our family for Christmas. Long story short after 4 canceled flights, over 13 hours of delays, and no available rental cars, we were stranded in Baltimore (BWI) for 34 hours. We missed our Christmas dinner and seeing family we get to see maybe once a year. Over this time we watched hundreds of people burst into tears and yell at customer service reps demanding a refund and trying to get home. We witnessed adults getting so deliberately drunk at airports they fall over and puke as they are trying to cope with this mess. I‚Äôm sure a lot of you guys are aware of this situation but if you want a further reason to buy puts on Southwest ($LUV), head over to r/SouthwestAirlines and read horror stories that are much worse than ours.¬†

Anyway, while my brother and I were stuck we decided to do some investigating into Southwest and why this shit show was happening. We have calculated that a low estimate for canceled flights is over 12,000 just these past few days. This whole mess is due to their crew tracking system software failing. They have had to revert back to legacy systems and manually figure out where each crew member is in order to get people in the air. This takes hours and is the reason they have been canceling so many flights. They have even gone as far as losing track of some of their pilots and crew members. On the very top of this mess, their customer service hotlines began crashing and USDOT is launching an investigation.

As you might know, the stock price has dropped \~10% as this has been making national headlines and Joe Biden even tweeted about it. However, there is a lot more pain to come for Southwest.

* An upcoming surge of flyers over NYE weekend will most likely overload their systems again as they are still playing catch up from this fiasco.
* U.S.D.O.T. is launching an investigation to understand what happened, who is at fault here, and how much Southwest will repay their customers.
* The majority of flyers who have flown Southwest in the past few days will never fly with them again, including me. Southwest is the new Spirit Airlines in my opinion.
* Southwest plans to refund customers for flights, hotels, food, and any rental cars customers had to buy due to canceled flights.
* The amount of bags that have been reported lost, stolen, or missing will generate thousands of claims to get money back.
* The upcoming Q4 earnings report will be an absolute shit show for them, as they have to find ways to refund people on the 12,000 flights that they have canceled so far.

A three-tier framework can serve as a roadmap for how to invest in vehicle electrification over time.  

The first tier is EV auto companies and battery manufacturers, the latter being one of the most vital suppliers to EV makers. As consumer adoption of EVs likely accelerates, these companies could be the most direct beneficiaries of increasing demand, with the battery market alone growing to $525 billion by 2040. Look for investment opportunities earlier in the industry‚Äôs growth, as production and demand ramp up.

The second is key suppliers for EV and battery makers, including semiconductor manufacturers, chemical and material processors, and metals and mining companies. Investment opportunities in these companies are also likely to be most plentiful early in the industry‚Äôs growth, as demand for their products continues to increase. In some cases, these suppliers may be a more attractive opportunity than pure-play EV manufacturers, because they often have a more diversified customer base and derive revenue from multiple industries.

The third: ancillary service providers, including software producers, power companies and tech firms targeting the auto industry to offer shared services. Given the relatively small market share of EVs today, investment opportunities related to such companies may seem minimal, but farther down the road, we expect these industries to expand meaningfully, with automobile-related technology services growing to a potential market as large as $10 trillion.

&amp;#x200B;

Companies exposed to the industry‚Äîparticularly those focused on continued innovation‚Äîcould be strong, long-term investments.

Short sellers in the company ‚Äî or bearish investors who stand to gain when an asset‚Äôs price falls ‚Äî are poised to reap mark-to-market profits of about $17 billion, making Tesla the most profitable short trade of the year, data from S3 Partners shows.

Tesla has tumbled more than 42% in December alone, driving it to a loss of 68% this year ‚Äî marking a radical about face for a stock that surged during the low-rate era of the pandemic.

It‚Äôs a rare victory for the shorts, whose 89% return comes after several years of significant losses, S3‚Äôs Ihor Dusaniwsky said. About 2.9% of Tesla‚Äôs free float is held short, according to S3 data.

Tesla has faced a tumultuous year, with investors fleeing risk assets over concerns about geopolitical uncertainty, high inflation, rising interest rates and a possible recession. Add to that worries that Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk‚Äôs focus will be diverted to his recently acquired social-media company, Twitter, just as demand for electric vehicles is set to take a hit.

Dusaniwsky expects short selling to persist until the stock reaches a bottom. But analysts and investors are still struggling to see a bottom, especially as the company is due to report fourth-quarter delivery numbers early next month and has been offering large buyer incentives.

Tesla shares rose 3.5% in premarket trading on Thursday.

Even if share price begins to recover, its notorious volatility could continue to linger, according to S3‚Äôs Dusaniwsky.

‚ÄúWhen Tesla‚Äôs stock begins to tick upwards, there should be a flurry of short covering which will help boost its stock price higher and quicker as shorter-term short sellers look to realize their outsized mark-to-market profits before they evaporate,‚Äù he said.

3142,wallstreetbets,"After shares of Tesla dipped by more than 10% on Tuesday deepening a year-long selloff, CEO Elon Musk told employees not to be ‚Äútoo bothered by stock market craziness.‚Äù

Musk circulated the comments on Wednesday in a companywide email, which CNBC obtained. He told staffers that Tesla needs to ‚Äúdemonstrate continued excellent performance,‚Äù and that ‚Äúlong-term, I believe very much that Tesla will be the most valuable company on Earth!‚Äù

Electric vehicle blog Electrek reported earlier on the email.

Tesla shares have declined about 68% for the year, though they rose 3.3% on Wednesday to $112.71. The stock is down 42% in December, and is poised to close out its worst month, quarter and year on record.

Musk has blamed Tesla‚Äôs declining share price in part on rising interest rates. But critics point to his Twitter takeover as a bigger culprit for the slide, which has wiped out about $675 billion in market cap this year as of Wednesday‚Äôs close.

In the email, Musk thanked Tesla employees for their work in 2022, encouraged them to push hard for a strong fourth-quarter finish, and asked them to ‚Äúvolunteer to help deliver‚Äù cars to customers before midnight on Dec. 31, if at all possible.

During the last days of most quarters, Tesla enlists employees from all over the company to bring new cars to customers in order to hit or exceed stated delivery goals, work that in normal times is limited to people on the sales and delivery teams. The company has been aiming for 50% year-over-year growth in vehicle deliveries but has cautioned investors it may not meet that target every year.

Musk‚Äôs attention has been focused on Twitter of late. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO sold tens of billions of dollars worth of shares in his electric vehicle company in 2022 to finance the $44 billion buyout of the social media company.

3177,wallstreetbets,"Blackrock and Goldman Sachs are two of the biggest names in finance, and their recent comments on the state of the global economy are worth paying attention to. 

Let's dive in in their 2023 plans.

In 2023, global growth is expected to remain weak, according to Goldman Sachs. The US economy is predicted to narrowly avoid a recession, with core PCE inflation slowing from its current level of 5% to 3% by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Blackrock predicts that interest rates will stop rising and economic activity will stabilize in 2023.

This new economic cycle is being driven by constraints on production. The shift in consumer spending from services to goods during the pandemic caused shortages and bottlenecks. Population aging also led to a labor shortage. As a result, developed countries are unable to produce as much as they used to without increasing inflation. Despite the fact that economic activity is below its pre-Covid levels, inflation is still very high.

Central bank policy rates are not the tool to resolve production constraints; they can only influence demand in their economies. This leaves them with a difficult trade-off. They can either get inflation back to 2% targets by reducing demand to what the economy can comfortably produce now, or they can live with more inflation.

 Right now, the **Federal Reserve** is **focused** on **avoiding a recession**. Although there are already **signs** of an **economic downturn**, **Blackrock** **expects** the **Fed** to **stop** **raising interest rates** once the **damage becomes clear.** As spending returns to normal, some production constraints may ease. However, **three long-term** **trends** are predicted to continue to limit production capacity and solidify the new economic system. **These are aging populations causing workforce shortages, ongoing geopolitical tensions disrupting supply chains and globalization, and the transition to net-zero carbon** 

 **Venturing into Unknown Economic Territory**

**Blackrock and Goldman Sachs are convinced that the current economic cycle will be distinct from previous ones. This new economic cycle is ongoing and cannot be halted.**

 

One key characteristic of this new economic cycle is that we are living in a supply-driven world with tough trade-offs. Repeated inflation surprises have sent bond yields soaring, crushing equities and fixed income. **This volatility stands in sharp contrast to the last 40 years of steady growth and inflation.**

In this **new economic cycle**, central banks are not expected to come to the rescue when growth slows. **Instead, they are deliberately causing recessions by implementing overly tight monetary policies in an effort to control inflation.**

According to Goldman Sachs, this economic cycle is unique because the recent normalization of supply chains and the rental housing market is causing disinflation, which was not seen in previous high-inflation episodes such as the 1970s. This is just starting to be reflected in official numbers. The shift in consumer spending from goods to services, the improvement of supply chains, and the increase in inventory levels are all putting downward pressure on core goods prices. Asking rents for new leases have also decreased after the spike in demand for space caused by the work-from-home trend. This suggests that the official measure of shelter inflation has likely peaked and will slow in the future.

 New Economic Cycle Requires New Investment Strategies

According to Blackrock, the key factor in their investment strategy is the amount of economic damage that has been accounted for in market prices. As such, their first investment theme for 2023 is damage pricing. They believe that current equity valuations do not fully reflect the potential damage and will become more positive on equities when they think the damage has been priced in or when their view of market risk changes. However, **Blackrock does not expect this to** **mark the beginning of another long bull market in stocks and bonds like the one we had in the last decade.**

**To succeed in the new economic cycle, investors will need to update their investment strategy**. This will involve making **more frequent changes to their portfolios by carefully considering their risk appetite and their estimates of how markets are accounting for economic damage.** It will also **involve taking a more detailed, granular approach to investment,** **focusing on specific sectors, regions, and sub-asset classes rather than broad exposures.**

**In the short term, Blackrock believes that treasury bonds and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) offer good opportunities**. They will keep a lot of inflation-linked bonds because they expect inflation to last longer than market prices suggest. **In the long term, Blackrock will remain underweight as long as long-term government bonds continue to face challenges**. In terms of stocks, **Blackrock believes that the potential recession is not fully reflected in corporate profits estimates or values**, and does not agree with market expectations that central banks will eventually become supportive by cutting interest rates.

To add more detail while staying underweight overall, **Blackrock is focusing on sectoral opportunities resulting from structural changes, such as healthcare for aging populations**. They also like cyclical in the **energy** and **banking sectors**. Earnings in the **energy sector** are stable even as they decline from historically high levels due to **limited energy supply**. Higher interest rates are good for **bank profits.**

**While reading outlooks for 2023 from investment funds can sometimes be confusing and contradictory, we must agree that the market is not the same as it once was. New economic cycles are emerging, and the aging populations in Europe and the United States are contributing to higher inflation due to a lack of sufficient workforce. It is clear that a new investment strategy is needed to navigate this changing landscape.**

3271,wallstreetbets," Hey fellow Wall Street Bets members! Are you tired of constantly losing money in the stock market? Are you ready to turn your portfolio into a money-making machine? Well, you're in luck! I'm here to share with you some insider tips and tricks that will help you dominate the stock market and turn a profit.

First and foremost, it's important to have a solid game plan. This means setting clear financial goals for yourself and devising a strategy to achieve them. Do you want to make a quick buck through day trading, or are you looking to build a long-term portfolio? Whatever your goal may be, make sure to have a clear plan in place before you start investing.

Next, it's crucial to stay up-to-date on the latest market news and trends. This means regularly reading financial news outlets and keeping an eye on social media for any breaking news or hot stock tips. It's also a good idea to follow industry experts and thought leaders on social media, as they often share valuable insights and analysis.

Another key to success in the stock market is diversification. Don't put all your eggs in one basket! Make sure to spread out your investments across a variety of industries and sectors to mitigate risk. This way, if one sector takes a hit, you won't lose everything.

Finally, don't be afraid to take calculated risks. The stock market is all about taking risks, and sometimes the biggest payouts come from the biggest risks. Just make sure to do your due diligence and only invest in companies or sectors that you have a strong understanding of.

I hope these tips help you on your journey to stock market domination! Remember, the key to success is having a solid game plan, staying informed, diversifying your portfolio, and taking calculated risks.

3275,wallstreetbets,"I have been in SQQQ (-3x of NDX100), and short position since couple of months. I do believe there will be some sort of recession, and over the course of another 6-7 months the markets(NDX, S&amp;P500) won‚Äôt give a +ve return. More likely to give a -ve return. Given this assumption, I wonder if it‚Äôs better to be buying SPXU (-3x of S&amp;P500) as compared to SQQQ. 

As shown below, in the line chart, NDX100 has fallen to June, 2020 levels as compared to S&amp;P500, which has fallen to Jan 2021. If the crash is going to be relatively neutral, there might be more room in S&amp;P500.

On the other hand, the crash might not be relatively neutral. The rise of NDX100 was outsized, and so is it‚Äôs volatility (box plot in above link). Also, the P/E ratio is NDX100 ~30, and S&amp;P500 is ~20. So with rising rates, it might impact NDX100 more as compared to S&amp;P500.

i started lurking on r/wallstreetbets a while ago and then decided options trading was right for me. i didn't have a lot of gambling money so i made a robinhood account and put $100 in there. 

so i used a strategy i learned here where i just google for news articles that have ""stock plummets"" in their headline and buy puts on that. turns out puts are really expensive because you have to buy them in groups of 100 like animal crossing turnips. so the minumum buy is a yolo.  

anyway i made a hundred bucks in a day with 1 contract of $34 $LUV put because southwest pooped its pants really hard that morning. it was fun but i want to be a millionaire like that one canadian guy. 

now every day at market open i google for some other company doing something unexpectedly and visibly dumb but it seems like it only happens every couple days.  i made 50 bucks on crypto but that didn't make me feel like a businessman so i quit.

3311,wallstreetbets,"Apes, Google stock is so tempting at current stock price. The issue is its CEO, he is concentrated on helping India and converting himself into a retroactive Google founder. He is not concentrated on benefiting Google stockholders, increasing stock buybacks, or product research and development.

Sundar needs to stop squeezing stockholders and get to work.

$100 billion in cash is enough to make major stock buybacks and heavily invest on new technologies. Every time I Google Sundararajan Pichai there are only news about him and India and about how he carries India in his heart wherever he goes. Like who the fuck cares, get to work, do your job!

Also, so many news about him wanting to make India the next technological epicenter of the world. Pleaseee man get to work and stop diluting our stocks!!!

He makes 15 billion stock buybacks and takes 1 billion in bonus to his pocket. What da fuck! Is that a scam??? We invested in Google and we are not getting dividends! Stop diluting our stocks man! People are really hating this ceo. He controls the alphabet board. The board members, besides the 2 founders, are a bunch of nobodies that he controls and they approve everything Sundararajan wants or desires including his ridiculous greedy compensation increase from $650k/year to $242 billion dollars a year. What on earth??? He makes the yearly salary of the U.S. president every 4 hours!!! The dilution that Google stockholders experience is insane. No company can sustain that level of corruption!

When is this going to stop? Is this blackmail? $242,000,000 a year, Sundararajan Pichai's compensation, is enough to hire the 484 best computer scientist/engineers on Earth (including India) and paid them a yearly salary of $500,000 a year. That would be more beneficial to Google. 

The stock is falling and falling. Stockholders feel scammed. This needs to be investigated by the FBI or the CIA. Google stockholders are losing money because he is diluting our stocks by taking 242 million dollars a year from Google's treasury stocks.

Where is Larry page and the other dude? Why don't they come back to Alphabet? Why are they letting this CEO dilute the company?

Google stockholders, do you see a light at the end of the tunnel with this CEO with that exorbitant compensation and ideology?

Google could acquire Nokia with a fraction of Sundararajan's compensation. Google could do so many things with that money.

How is it justified that this dude makes 484 times the salary of the U.S. president? What a scam. 

What are your thoughts guys? 

PD: I know there are bots supporting the Sundararajan on Reddit. Plus the 2 billion Indian who support him. They are biased because he is Indian. The don't want to recognize than this CEO's compensation is ridiculous regardless of his ancestry!

Let get a new CEO from India that makes 5 millions a year instead of 242 million dollars!and let's use the extra money to bring the brightest minds and engineers from all over the world (including India)",Google,1672268528

Saw this chart posted a few weeks ago that breaks down santa rallies and how the markets react‚Ä¶ of course this is just a blip of the last 23 years and is not an exhaustive list‚Ä¶ however, I would say the biggest thing to note here is that the average return in January when there is no santa rally is -4.38%. That is a pretty bloody January.

Tomorrow we get another jobs report‚Ä¶ I took a quick look at the last 5 reports. Interestingly enough we are averaging a 0.25% open on JOB reporting mornings. Since the December FOMC meeting we have not opened green on a jobs data day and we are actually for those two openings averaging a -1.04% red open‚Ä¶

I mentioned that diamond pattern overnight on SPY and Futures and that futures had broken through support which should have opened up the downside. Well we finally got the downside we were looking for all last week. 

This break down today is the first time SPY has closed below 378 since November 9th (the day before November CPI). This also after 8 trading days consolidating between 379.6 and 386.4 the first time we have closed outside of that consolidation area. We also were once again able to wick to and hard reject that daily 8ema. 

With us now losing 378 support should now be looking for a retest of support near 374 and an ultimate retest of 370.6. If we lose 370.6 then going into Friday and beginning of 2023 opens up a potential for a drop into the 350s/360s. However, if we can get a hard bounce at 370.6 and break back over 378 resistance then we still could be looking for a 390.1 retest. 

Despite how much bearish momentum we have on spy here I do worry as we have been bear trapped time and time again here over the last 2 trading weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Same pattern here on futures which as I mentioned yesterday with that breakdown through the diamond support it should have opened up the downside flush. We did start that leg down today. We also finally closed a candle below that 3845 to 3920 consolidation period. We now are trading at that key pivot point of 3805. 

If we lose 3805 then next support is 3750 followed my 3675. 

However, 3805 could hold as a big support area for us here. If that support holds then we are going to look for a bigger pop up to retest previous support at 3845. If we can break through that level then we are eyeing once again 3875 and 3910. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla the crazy sum betch did it! She put in a green day! 

This is the FIRST green day tesla has closed in over 9 trading days (8 red days in a row). This is the biggest close at 3.31% since November 30th which was a 7.67% green day. 

Taking a look at Tesla i had mentioned before that there is a clear trend of big red drop -&gt; consolidation (red or green) -&gt; big drop -&gt; consolidation.. etc. etc‚Ä¶ 

Being that today was not only a gravestone doji but also an inside day‚Ä¶ we could actually be looking at a nice setup for a push back down tomorrow. 

Looking at this tight red bear channel 117.8 is the resistance for that level. And also yesterdays daily candle resistance level. IF we get another big push up on Tesla that could result in a bigger push down. 

Key support is 108.9 -&gt; 103.2

Key resistance is 112.7 -&gt; 117.8

Here is another fun little chart on Tesla‚Ä¶ Since September 21st‚Ä¶ if we look at all the days it closed &gt;-4% you can see there is actually a 60% chance that the next day it opens green‚Ä¶ the average green open is 0.55%... This could net a nice 10-20% win on Tesla calls‚Ä¶ now mind you these most likely need to be closed immediately at open though as it usually dumps hard‚Ä¶ 

Interestingly enough though‚Ä¶ since September 21st 100% of the time that it has closed greater than -7% down it has opened green the next day‚Ä¶. With an average green open of 1.63%. 

Some more food for thought‚Ä¶

Taking a look at the VIX I mentioned how I felt it has been suppressed and despite every effort to breakout is struggling. Well we actually had a really nice breakout triangle formed on the VIX. It managed to hold support and breakout through the daily 8 and daily 20ema. This too was a bullish engulfing candle. 

Now the question is what will the VIX do next‚Ä¶ today was one of the first days we didn‚Äôt see a huge green open on the VIX in a while.. and that actually led to a pretty big drop intraday. The VIX also held its peak going into the end of the day too which has not been the common theme lately. 

23.6 is the key breakout level and also the key bear channel resistance level for tomorrow.

Today actually was a pretty great trading day. Had a really nice swing put win on SPY and then played some nice intraday puts and l2l plays. I actually didn‚Äôt trade much after noon today. The issue was that we were so close to that 378 support area that the risk to reward of a huge bounce which we did get was there. However, despite the fact that VOLD fully support that massive run up we had at noon to 1pm I did not believe in the rally and was waiting for the classic 123 rollercoaster down.

3386,wallstreetbets,"Hello everyone, I hope you have all had a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. As we get close to entering the new year, I thought I would be useful and relevant to analyze the market this past year. More specifically, to look at where we started, where we are at now, and where the market may head in the coming year. It is important for all traders/investors to reflect on their performance and see what they did right as well as what they did wrong. Doing this is a crucial element in improving your skills.

https://preview.redd.it/1qc6ul5sep8a1.png?width=2270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c6e75d82042551eb00497ba6a2ada0d7c1b920b

We started 2022 with a new high, but quickly pulled back from that level in the following trading sessions. If we look further back to September 2021 it is apparent that weakness is beginning to show in the market. We had a sharp pull back in September 2021 with heavy selling. The market was able to rally and recover but did so on low volume, indicating a lack in support on the buy side. As we went into the new year the market was weak and after the first trading day began to roll over.

https://preview.redd.it/1uymvnosep8a1.png?width=1441&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=426a7ca9a8971b1be1b7b1b1c8b5cd2be58b5ea9

The main culprit of the market rollover is increasing inflation as well as the Federal Reserves response. Inflation does seem to have peeked in July 2022, but this does not mean that interest rates will go back to near zero anytime soon. It is likely that fed rates will remain elevated until it is clear that inflation is tamed. Additional concerns extend from uncertainty due to the Russia-Ukraine war as well as rising Covid-19 cases in China resulting from the end of the zero tolerance covid policy.

https://preview.redd.it/1pzuqn6tep8a1.png?width=2265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=225ad4bbe849cd4486d53b8198cff5af297371fb

With these hostile market conditions, many may think there is little to nothing to do in the market. That cannot be further from the truth, there is almost always some industry or sector that is experiencing positive price action. For instance, early in 2022 the oil and gas industry was booming as a result of decreasing covid restrictions as well as fuel price increases as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war. The shipping industry also produces several companies that had positive price increases throughout 2022. Lastly, there were several bear market rallies within the overall market and individual companies that were not only trade-able but also very profitable with proper risk management. While these are not the only industries that were positive in 2022, they serve as a basis to instill the idea that opportunities are all around us, we just have to find them.

Even with inflation subsiding, the market is on track to end the year close to its 52-week lows. So what will it take to regain ground lost in 2022? The answer is most likely Fed rate cuts with a side of global stability in terms of war and disease. However, the Fed is not likely to start rate cuts until mid 2023 at the earliest. As for global stability, there is not telling how long the Russia-Ukraine war will last as well as rising covid cases. So what does this mean for investors/traders? Should we just call it quits and wait for 2024? Obviously the answer is no. We need to keep a similar mindset as we have had this year. That is being cautious in our positions and knowing that this market is still very news driven. An article or economic data release can cause major swings in any direction. We have to be prepared to quickly get rid of losers because a small loss can easily turn into an unmanageable larger loss. For now enjoy the holidays and prepare yourself for a new year filled with limitless opportunities.

What if I told you there is a sector that virtually guaranteed to pay you? A sector where the typical corp has **never cut dividends**?

I am talking, of course, about Canadian Banks, the oligopoly that keeps on distributing.

Enter Exhibit-A:

&amp;#x200B;

[Dividends in C$ of Canadian Banks 1995-2022 \[Non-accumulative\]](https://preview.redd.it/aqe37ny4uo8a1.png?width=1527&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5f8ee005f6e9ae0cc5b6b27023d3926014ef68a)

The y-axis is the money they pay you (every month, or quarter.) **It is non-accumulative, straight up payments to you.**

*\[These graphs were brought to you by my amazing coding skills, Python, matplotlib and yahoo-finance.\]*

Observe! Four of these have never cut their dividend. Find the two ugly ducklings amount them... (National bank of Canada stopped divs in 2000s, Royal Bank of Canada cut theirs once, in the 90s.)

Why is this? Because a Canadian Bank **always** makes money. In good times, and in recessions, where they get to bleed their customers dry on penalties.

So, it is all about the dividends then, is it?

No... the blood-bath that is Tech, where corps that have never turned a profit (looking at you, $LCID) are valued at a gazillion dollars will **drive the investors to sectors like Canadian Banking**.

**You may not like dividends, but your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air, sure do.**

So I expect **big capital gains** ahead. I mean... where else is fleeing capital to go? Real Estate? Hah! Bonds? Lame! 

Ok, having established where the money will be, how do we pick one? Frankly, you could skip this part, and buy all six, but I will humour you:

TD 3-yr revenue increase: $41B -&gt; $46B

CM 3-yr revenue increase: $18B -&gt; $22B

RY 3-yr revenue increase: $46B -&gt; $49B

BNS 3-yr revenue increase: $30B -&gt; $31B

NA 3-yr revenue increase: $7B -&gt; $10B

BMO 3-yr revenue increase: $25 -&gt; $26B

The dividend yield:

TD 4.35%

CM 6.21%

RY 4.12%

BNS 6.21%

NA 4.21%

BMO 4.66%

Based on their growth and yield, I will be buying Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ($CM.TO) today.

Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Relief Act of 2020 had a rule that allowed businesses to take 100% deductions off restaurant meals.

Prior to this rule, restaurant meals were only 50% deductible. This rule did not apply to pre-prepared meals, grocery bought foods. Groceries are also 50% deductible. The purpose of this tax benefit was to help restaurants during a time that the hospitality industry was suffering. This benefit comes to an end at the start of 2023

Here is the rule: [IRS Rules](https://i.postimg.cc/PJPsrQJL/image.png)

So let me explain why this is bad for restaurants. In a companies accounting, they label each expense.

For example, a grocery related expense is expensed to a general ledger account code 5001

A restaurant related expense is expensed to a general ledger account code 5002

all the expenses under account code 5001 are 50% deductible

all the expenses under account code 5002 and 100% deductible

So here's the current situation in 2021 to 2022 with examples: [Current Example](https://i.postimg.cc/LX4hDwCr/image.png)

And here's how that tax amount will change in 2023: [Future Example](https://i.postimg.cc/MHKRcvJf/image.png)

Notice how in the future example, companies will have to pay more tax. So this benefit going away will in my personal opinion, discourage businesses to take our employees for restaurant meals. Sure it will still happen, but I think it will happen much less.",Are Restaurants about to take a big hit to the chin in 2023?,1672255341

Now mind you this assumes obviously that we DO see a breakdown in q1. If we didn‚Äôt get a breakdown while an individual like Tesla could still capitulate and see a correction‚Ä¶ its possible no one becomes the best short. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0naetyw7po8a1.png?width=1206&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=704c0ef0f040e5eeb2ce06ef93452b57bb5d259a

Note- all data for this document was obtained on 12/27 during and after market close. 

Now lets go ahead and break this all down and rank them‚Ä¶ what I am going to do is rank 1 through 9‚Ä¶ 1 would be a bearish indicator on the stock and a 9 would be a bullish indicator. 

**What is Trailing P/E vs. Forward P/E?**

The forward P/E uses projected future earnings to calculate the price-to-earnings ratio. The trailing P/E, which is the standard form of a price-to-earnings ratio, is calculated using recent past earnings.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/de6ha5h8po8a1.png?width=413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d059b0b2296346ca71885894283b9bce0959276d

Based on standard PE we actually see that Amazon has the current highest PE at 78.28 and Meta (not surprisingly) has the lowest PE at 11.24). This would indicate a strike against Amazon and make it strictly looking at PE the best short. This would obviously make Meta the worse short. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qa8hslx8po8a1.png?width=403&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f629576a31bde62cbce6f297ab42cb71f85d7a4

Taking a look at forward P/E you can see that still Amazon with 50.57 has the worst F P/E and Meta at 14.72 has the most favorable PE. 

**What Is the Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) Ratio?** 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/krqn1zm9po8a1.png?width=374&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be5b022629ae3b14369bb3e2e90e3cd02f6d3dbc

The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period. A PEG ratio of under 1.0 can indicate a stock is undervalued and a potential buy. A PEG above 1.0 can indicate an overvalued stock.

Taking a look at the PEG ratio (remember the higher the level the most overbought/ over valued the stock is) we see that nvidia with a 3.55 is the most overbought and amazon comes in next with a 2.95. Not surprising Tesla has the lowest at 0.84 (mostly due to the 40%+ drop in the month of December). 

**% changes from critical points** 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y1oa9bbapo8a1.png?width=416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe9f1dd84c3b859eb07e0e10be2c8509d6033f00

Taking a look at the YTD drop Tesla has had the biggest YTD drop at 71.48% and SPY actually had the smallest YTD drop of just 17.33%. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xwpdu7uapo8a1.png?width=378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98af72979fe04efca15539a8171f6ce9dd363cb0

This breakdown here represents how far above or below the ticker currently is of its weekly 200ema. Apple, MSFT and SPY are the only tickers above its weekly 200ema (the positive number) and all the other tickers are below that number (represented by the negative number). The number represents what % below or % above the weekly 200ema they are‚Ä¶  
 

Currently Apple is the further above its weekly 200ema which could represent that it has the biggest room to fall‚Ä¶ Meta is the furthest below its Weekly 200ema. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aghcqxdbpo8a1.png?width=415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc0c9617fbf5c5fc1c7cee4a8209cebb431bf1b7

Taking a look at the % the ticker currently sits below its ATH. You can see that Tesla is sitting -74.7% below its ATH while SPY is only 20.6% below its ATH making SPY potentially have the biggest room to fall. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7po7icxbpo8a1.png?width=359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb081d2e6f53b36856a35927e0df4299bce58bf

This one here represent how far above or below the current ticker is from the 2020 Covid crash lows. Many believe that the 2020 covid lows is the likely target if we have a market wide sell off in Q1. As you can see Nvidia and Meta are the only tickers below their covid 2020 lows. 

Tesla surprisingly is still 78.6% above its Covid 2020 low. 

**June 16th 2023 Put Premium**

Using the optionscalculator to ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù the best put play I came up with the following strikes for potential June 16th DTE puts. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sfowsdfcpo8a1.png?width=425&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=390f7e1b70c7831d2f4097635253db4d4db3b51c

The reason I wanted to include this as it shows how pricey premiums already are. As you can see Tesla not surprisingly due to its high IV and further drop expectations is one of the highest premiums and Google remains the lowest. 

**Lets rank the most ‚Äúovervalued‚Äù and most ‚Äúoversold‚Äù**  
   
 

https://preview.redd.it/usobec0dpo8a1.png?width=338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bb728f541467c395e1950e87dbf9bbf9a363951

Remember we ranked 1 through 9. With 1 being overvalued and 9 being oversold. Therefore the lower the overall numbers using all the above metrics the potential better short a stock ticker is. 

So taking a look here we see that Apple is the clear short winner with Amazon, MSFT, and SPY close behind. 

Now lets take a look at these and where we could be heading. We will take a look at Apple, Amazon, MSFT and SPY weekly charts. 

**Apple Weekly chart** 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u4nm4xkdpo8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fe8cf5e35b2a2f82460e17891d83eb9f6768c92

The apple weekly chart in my opinion has the most room to fall‚Ä¶ a few big targets to keep in mind here‚Ä¶ 

Weekly 200ema- 120.15

Late 2020 support- 106.9

March 2020 support- 57.4

Current bear channel march projection- 64.33 

Current bear channel June projection- 44.15

**Amazon Weekly Chart** 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w7y6a83epo8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3da709dfc0f93152e1a3d74acf28d086eefa5ad

Taking a look here you can see we have been riding down the weekly 8ema and we are within a few weeks of the death cross on amazon (100ema below 200ema). 

March 2020 support- $81.74

Current bear channel march projection- $47.31 

Current bear channel June projection- $32

2017 support- $47.31

2016 support- $24.36

**MSFT weekly chart**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zetxxbmepo8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a1b52631108877f5136f2aa0c57a2ca03449944

Now when you take a look at MSFT I think much like apple it has one of the strongest of big techs charts this year. It has not seen that massive drop like most of tech has. However, Apple and MSFT are obviously the biggest holdings in SPY for a reason‚Ä¶

Weekly 200ema- $224.47

Late 2020 support- $196.4

March 2020 support- $136.8

Current bear channel march projection- $177.85 

Current bear channel June projection- $157.57

**SPY weekly chart**

Last but not least is our boy spy‚Ä¶ 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/oset9i8fpo8a1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7388a2aa00b12725009ceb5af661497cc2906051

Taking a look at SPY here you can see that we have that similar breakdown as big tech but our bear channel is way wider than most of tech. 

Weekly 200ema- $366.89

Late 2020 support- $325.6

March 2020 support- $228

Current bear channel march projection- $300 

Current bear channel June projection- $281

3546,wallstreetbets,"I believe there is a lot of potential in Blackberry (BB).  I'm not a WSBer, but all the investing subs have blocked my posts because BB was caught up in the meme stocks, so WSB is the only place left.  This post focuses on a new product called **Blackberry Ivy**, launched in partnership with Amazon AWS.

If you haven‚Äôt been following BB, they no longer make phones and have transitioned to software. Their two main plays are cybersecurity and IoT, with a specific focus on QNX, a real-time operating system currently installed in 215M+ vehicles on the road.  While cybersecurity has been disappointing, QNX has been steady and shows promise.  QNX is used by 24 of the top 25 electric vehicle manufacturers (only missing Tesla) and medical/industrial equipment.  You will see articles saying QNX is being ditched for Android Auto, but this is just for infotainment.  QNX is still in these cars for safety-critical systems and runs below Android Auto.  To use a crude analogy, Android Auto is like Chrome and QNX is Windows.  However, this post is on a new product, called **Blackberry Ivy**, which has no known competitor and is first-to-market.

**What is Blackberry Ivy?**

Ivy is an auto software product that processes and standardizes sensor data both in the car and in the cloud. It allows for applications do be built more efficiently in cars and, in my opinion, will transform the auto apps market just like Apple app store or Android/Google Play did to phone apps.

To give just one example of what Ivy could do, imagine being a third-party app developer who wants to build an app for the auto market that recognizes when a vehicle occupant has fallen asleep, so the vehicle environment can be adjusted for a more enjoyable ride (e.g. The app would turn off air conditioning near that person, turn off volume from closest speaker, etc.). The way to determine if an occupant has fallen asleep is by using data from an inward-facing camera.  However, the auto manufacturer would never grant access to raw camera data to a third-party app developer. This is where Ivy comes in. Ivy standardizes the outputs, so you do not need the raw data. The data from the camera is sent to Ivy, where it is processed to standard outputs  (e.g. Driver = awake, Front-Passenger = awake, Rear-Right-Passenger =  asleep, etc.). The app uses these standardized outputs to create some action in the vehicle without ever seeing the actual video feed.

An app created with Ivy can then be used with any auto manufacturer using Ivy software, creating a  much larger app market.  A developer no longer has to make separate apps for Ford and BMW vehicles systems, he can just build his app with Ivy and that will work on any car using Ivy.  (Think how cell phones used to each create their own apps, until Android allowed them to share a common marketplace).  This is especially important for niche apps that already struggle to find a market.

The previous example is just a single example. There are numerous use-cases that can be described for vehicle payment systems, insurance, car maintenance, etc. with many of these already in the works. There is also tremendous potential for a consumer-focused or novelty app marketplace.  For example, Spotify could make a feature in their app that identifies the occupants and their music preferences, so the vehicle only plays songs that the most number of occupants would enjoy. That way someone who loves country music will not have to suffer through a rap playlist (e.g. In-ward facing camera sends video data to Ivy, Ivy outputs: Occupant ID: 30432493, Occupant ID: 34824492 are sent to the Spotify app, which uses an algorithm to cross-reference these IDs with playlists and finds songs both occupants would enjoy.  Spotify never has to see the raw camera data, yet it gives them a great feature for their app.  The car manufacturer benefits because they can create a better driving experience without having to spend a lot of money developing niche apps). This, of course, assumes some level of permission has been given by the occupants to be identified.

**What is Blackberry Ivy worth in revenue?**

BB's SAM estimate of $800M for Ivy in 2024 suggests Ivy could be worth up to $36.36/car/year (based on \~20M QNX vehicles and \~2M Tesla vehicles being produced in 2024).  I encourage you to do your own calculation.  Let's say Ivy is worth $10/car/year (with BB getting a 50% cut for $5/car/year).  Multiply $5/car/year by how many cars you think may adopt Ivy and be on the road for any given year (remember, BB QNX is currently installed into \~20M new cars each year, with the EV market set to grow).

If all 215M+ cars that currently run on QNX had Ivy, that would produce $1B in revenue each year.  I  believe Ivy will eventually bring in $1B/year for BB, the question is will it take 5 year or 10 years to get there.  Keep in mind, BB‚Äôs total revenue for FY 2022 (essentially calendar year 2021) was $718M, so this  would be a significant jump in revenue.

BB's SAM disclosure for Ivy can be found here @ 24:17 (Note: FY 2025 for BB is essentially calendar year 2024): [https://wsw.com/webcast/oppenheimer23/bb/2273700](https://wsw.com/webcast/oppenheimer23/bb/2273700)

**What would this do to the stock price?**

BB would now be valued more like a high growth stock. BB currently has a P/S ratio of 3.1. High growth stocks like Crowdstrike (11.6), Cloudflare (16.4), Datadog (15.0), and ZScaler (12.7) all have much higher P/S ratios. If BB were to be valued similar to these companies (e.g. P/S ratio of 15) that would put the stock price at $15.92/share just for 2024. **This target stock price does not take into account any future revenue from Ivy, only BB being valued more like a growth stock based on current revenue.**

**Will Blackberry Ivy actually be adopted by auto manufacturers?**

There have been a number of recent indicators suggesting Ivy will be adopted by auto manufacturers.   Ivy is a 50/50 partnership with Amazon, but it is only in the last couple of months that Amazon AWS engineers have become more vocal about Ivy.  Sure, Amazon is involved in many ventures, but this seems different.  Ivy was featured a number of times at Amazon's re:Invent 2022 conference just a few weeks ago.  Amazon's general manager of automotive name-dropped Blackberry Ivy during a  presentation and that presentation had two other speakers: a senior vice president from Stellantis, who spoke about how Stellantis (which owns  Dodge/Fiat/Chrysler/Jeep/Opel/Peugeot/Ram/Vauxhall) is transitioning to a software-defined vehicle, and Amazon's general manager of automotive   technology, who discussed BB's QNX operating system and how Amazon was bringing it to the cloud.  Here is the presentation (Ivy name-drop after 13:00): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tse4B-fnbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tse4B-fnbI)

The inclusion of Stellantis in a presentation discussing BB Ivy and BB QNX is notable.  When the first live demo of Ivy was presented at Bosch ConnectedWorld 2022 in November, the vehicle used in the demo was a Peugeot, a brand owned by Stellantis (Bosch, a leading supplier for automotive, is also partnering with Ivy).  At the earnings call last week, BB announced they will be demoing Ivy at CES 2023 in a Jeep Cherokee, another brand owned by Stellantis.

[Ivy live demo at Bosch ConnectedWorld in November](https://preview.redd.it/ldum9emvwn8a1.jpg?width=1125&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=519417edfdb6e37f082ad1f47fafde651d810e44)

BB announced they hope to have the first design win for Ivy by CES on Jan 5-8 and I expect Stellantis will be the first manufacturer to sign-on to Ivy (If it's not announced at CES, the next bet would be the earnings call in March).  Stellantis' CEO will also deliver a keynote at CES.

Re:Invent also featured another presentation on Blackberry Ivy being run by representatives from Amazon and Bosch.  That presentation was shared by two BMW engineers discussing machine learning.  One of Ivy's selling points is to better allow for machine learning models to be applied to   the data generated by the car sensors.  BMW also recently signed deals with Amazon AWS and already uses BB QNX.  Here is the presentation:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI2RwYUN92E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI2RwYUN92E)

It's an interesting coincidence that Stellantis and BMW are in presentations that discuss/mention BB Ivy, as well as doing public demos in Stellantis vehicles.

The AWS/Bosch presentation on Ivy had a very interesting slide showing companies that are already partnering with Ivy and showing some potential use-cases for Ivy:

Notice TomTom is mentioned for location-based services.  TomTom recently announced a collaboration with Amazon, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft to create a new open map data system known as Overture Maps Foundation to counter Google Maps' dominance.  Does TomTom plan to send their own version of a Google Street View car around the world?  No.  It appears that TomTom plans to leverage the data already being collected by software-defined vehicles on the road.  How can TomTom use data from different auto manufacturers, each with their own systems?  Ivy standardizes it.  TomTom can then use the improved maps to service consumers.  Auto manufacturers bring in additional revenue selling the data collected from the vehicles and consumers get greatly improved mapping services.  Everyone wins.  And it is Ivy that facilitates this.  (Credit to [u/snoutandtruffle](https://www.reddit.com/u/snoutandtruffle/) for bringing TomTom to my attention.  I recommend reading every one of his posts about Ivy as he is the best at spotting new info, IMHO).

Blackberry Ivy is also agnostic, meaning manufacturers don't have to use Amazon AWS cloud or BB QNX in order to use Ivy.  This gives them complete control over the data.

**Final Thoughts:**

I'm not here to pump and dump a stock.  I'm also not claiming BB will become a $1T company.  But, I believe BB will be successful and will become many times more valuable than it is now.  Time will tell.  Keep an eye on BB.  Set reminders for Jan 9 and Mar 31 and see if any auto manufacturers have signed-on to Ivy.  If they have (especially if Stellantis is named), come back to this post with a new set of eyes.

He‚Äôd joined Morgan Stanley in the grim days of 2009, when big banks were trying to pay back taxpayer bailouts and deflect public fury. But four years later, the ire was fading and ambition was the order of the day.

‚ÄúIt really felt like, for the first time, the job and the career weren‚Äôt defined by the context of the financial crisis,‚Äù Diop said. ‚ÄúWe are past this now. And now it‚Äôs time for us to do new deals.‚Äù In the years that followed, his rise to managing director traced a new boom. He helped orchestrate a multibillion-dollar deal with SoftBank Group, whose breakneck investments defined an era, then closed a huge SPAC merger at the height of that rush.

Diop didn‚Äôt know it, but he was playing a small role in something almost unfathomably lucrative: The first trillion-dollar decade for the six giants of US banking. That‚Äôs not $1 trillion of total revenue, it‚Äôs pure profit.

Such a haul didn‚Äôt seem possible before the decade began, when Wall Street was the target of a global protest movement and politicians at both ends of the spectrum were seething over bailouts or aiming to break up too-big-to-fail lenders.

I tried posting the update earlier and it was taken down by spam filters. So. Let's try this again.

**TL;DR** \- Lower levels of trading activity this week - shorter week and the holidays season, so could be that execs are focusing less on the markets.

Flagging notable buys:

* Ayar Third Investment Co (10% Owner) increased their stake in Lucid Group, Inc ($LCID) with a $915M purchase (+8% increase in shares owned)
* Hill Path Capital Partners (10% Owner) bought \~$32M of Dave &amp; Busters ($PLAY)
* Durable Capital Partners (10% Owner) bought $14M of Duolingo ($DUOL)
* Bill Ackman + Pershing Square bought another $3.8M of Howard Hughes ($HHC) (Real Estate)
* Tobias, Lutke, a director at Coinbase ($COIN), bought $365,570 (+7.44%)

And some notable sales from insiders:

* Henry Schuck, the CEO of Zoominfo Technologies ($ZI), sold \~$28M (-6.54%)
* Stephane Bancel, the CEO of Moderna ($MRNA), sold $16.5M (-1.47%)
* Suren Gupta, the President of Enterprise Services at Allstate Corp ($ALL), sold $5.4M in shares, a 39% decrease in shares owned

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $76M to $971M (+1,173%)
* Sales decreased from $6.4B to $856M (-87%)
* Transactions decreased from 807 to 382 (-53%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s decreased from 449 to 207 (-54%)  

   * Net buyers decreased from 62 to 24 (-61%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 387 to 183 (-53%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s decreased from 720 to 328 (-54%)  

   * Net buyers decreased from 103 to 30 (-71%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 617 to 298 (-52%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **December 19th - December 23rd.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of ‚ÄúP‚Äù or ‚ÄúS‚Äù. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Indirect** transactions are now included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **December 12th - December 16th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

The best summary of the Twitter buyout I can find online is here:

[https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/elon-twitter-buyout/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/elon-twitter-buyout/)

Which states:

""Musk  will borrow US$12.5 billion using a margin loan collateralized by  Musk‚Äôs ownership of Tesla stock. If we use a recent Tesla price of  US$850/share and a 20% Loan-to-Value, this implies that Musk will need  to pledge roughly 73.5 million Tesla shares to secure this margin loan.  These shares are valued at roughly US$62.5 billion as shown below.""

""Per  last year‚Äôs Tesla proxy statement (from August 2021), Musk has roughly  88.3 million shares already pledged as collateral to secure certain  personal indebtedness as shown below. He currently owns approximately  172.6 million Tesla shares. Assuming the 88.3 million shares are still  pledged as other collateral, and including the shares pledged for the  margin loan, Musk has pledged 94% of his Tesla stock ownership.""

""In  summary, Musk is contributing US$21.0 billion in equity financing, but  also US$12.5 billion via a margin loan on his existing Tesla ownership.  However, Musk is also searching for other potential equity investors  (including convertible security owners) to contribute equity to the  buyout. If Musk doesn‚Äôt find any equity partners, he will effectively be  responsible for US$33.5 billion, which represents 72% of the Twitter  buyout total of US$46.5 billion.""

This  article posts a worst-case-scenario for Elon because we know he got  last minute investors with some crypto firms and the Saudis. Also, keep  in mind Elon has been on a Tesla selling spree since the article was  written. All of these things contribute to protecting him from a margin  call.

Quick reminder that there are **2 slots left for the Form Fore closed beta**. Message me if interested.

**TL;DR** \- Lower levels of trading activity this week - shorter week and the holidays season, so could be that execs are focusing less on the markets.

Again flagging notable buys:

* Ayar Third Investment Co (10% Owner) increased their stake in Lucid Group, Inc ($LCID) with a $915M purchase (+8% increase in shares owned)
* Hill Path Capital Partners (10% Owner) bought \~$32M of Dave &amp; Busters ($PLAY)
* Durable Capital Partners (10% Owner) bought $14M of Duolingo ($DUOL)
* Bill Ackman + Pershing Square bought another $3.8M of Howard Hughes ($HHC) (Real Estate)
* Tobias, Lutke, a director at Coinbase ($COIN), bought $365,570 (+7.44%)

And some notable sales from insiders:

* Henry Schuck, the CEO of Zoominfo Technologies ($ZI), sold \~$28M (-6.54%)
* Stephane Bancel, the CEO of Moderna ($MRNA), sold $16.5M (-1.47%)
* Suren Gupta, the President of Enterprise Services at Allstate Corp ($ALL), sold $5.4M in shares, a 39% decrease in shares owned

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $76M to $971M (+1,173%)
* Sales decreased from $6.4B to $856M (-87%)
* Transactions decreased from 807 to 382 (-53%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s decreased from 449 to 207 (-54%)
   * Net buyers decreased from 62 to 24 (-61%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 387 to 183 (-53%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s decreased from 720 to 328 (-54%)
   * Net buyers decreased from 103 to 30 (-71%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 617 to 298 (-52%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **December 19th - December 23rd.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of ‚ÄúP‚Äù or ‚ÄúS‚Äù. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Indirect** transactions are now included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **December 12th - December 16th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

3616,wallstreetbets,"$V and $MA both are global payment processing companies that operate networks of electronic payment systems and issue credit and debit cards. $V is the larger of the two companies and has a larger global presence. They both generate revenue by charging fees to merchants and financial institutions for the use of their payment processing network. They enable the electronic transfer of funds between banks and other financial institutions.

$AAPL has moved in recent years into the payment service. With Apple wallet, a digital wallet that allows you to store and manage your loyalty cards, boarding passes, movie tickets, coupons, and other types of passes in one place, and with Apple Pay, which allows users to make payments in person, in iOS apps, and on the web, with connecting. These services have been embraced by many customers.

According to the National Retail Federation, the adoption of mobile payments like Apple Pay has been steadily increasing in the US, with an estimated of 34% of smartphone users making a mobile payment in 2021. Additionally, in a recent survey said that 73% of respondents said contactless payments were a more convenient form of payment. The only disadvantage is that not all consumers, particularly older ones, don‚Äôt feel comfortable with the technology.

So with a large costume base and user exposure, if $AAPL decides to one day create its own credit card will $V and $MA go bankrupt?

Let‚Äôs look at some financials:

* $V total revenue $29.310B, Net income $14.957B, and Free Cash Flow of $17.879B. $MA total revenue $18.884B, Net income $8.687B, and Free Cash Flow of $8.649B.
* $V revenue has grown in the last year by 21%, and $MA revenue has grown in the last year by 23%.

|\*\*Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers\*\*Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment‚Äôs price.\*I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.\*\*The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.\*|

|\&amp;nbsp;

\*\*Things to consider when finding the plays-\*\*¬∑ If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.¬∑ If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play. (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.)¬∑ The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.|

In the 80s and 90s, being added to the S&amp;P 500 went hand in hand with a boost of 4 - 7%, and being deindexed led to a similarly powerful negative effect. But since 2010 that effect has largely disappeared. 

This is the authors' summary of why this is the case, but I don't really understand it (my bad, not theirs):

""To sum up, our assessment is that the declining index effect is driven by primarily two factors: an increase in migrations over time from the S&amp;P MidCap Index, and an overall increase in the market‚Äôs ability to provide liquidity to index changes. We cannot rule out that a third factor, increased predictability of index changes, played some role. Overall then, when demand shocks become regular and repeated, competitive markets adapt over time to minimize price impact...""","New study shows that since 2010, being added to (or removed from) the S&amp;P 500 no longer increases (or decreases) a company's results",1672222702

3685,wallstreetbets,"Hello Regards.

This is my first post here and i would like to present to you a true regarded bet, since i found nothing related to this stock in this sub.

A friend of my presented this company to me, named Neonode, which is currently in a legal dispute with Apple, Samsung and Alphabet regarding a patent relevant to the ""slide to unlock"" function present in almost every produced phone from these companies. 

Neonode claims they were the ones that invented the slide to unlock function and is now suing the giants for patent infringement. The interesting thing is that Neonode actually had success in the first leg in the legal dispute where Apple and Samsung tried to invalidate the patent, but the judge decided the Neonode patent from the early 2000's was valid.

IF the second half of the legal dispute is won in January, the company could see huge upsides. (And if a loss, even larger downside). This is why i think this case suits this subreddit so well, it is merely an educated coin flip. 

More information can be found from this guy who have followed the case for the last couple of years:

However, I am by no means an expert in the stock market, and I want to be sure that I am making a smart and informed decision with my money. That's why I am reaching out to this community for some additional perspective and guidance.

Do any of you have experience investing in Getty Images, or have you heard anything about the company that would make it a good or bad investment opportunity? If not, do you have any other recommendations for a smart investment opportunity that I should consider?

No MF, the stock captitulated. It‚Äôs heading to $0 unless management announces a buyback but they give zero fucks about investors. The div payout ratio is currently 154%.. let that sink in.

EPS IS GOING to go negative like it did prior to being listed. These cock suckies had pre Covid info on lockdowns and spot rates so they timed their listing perfectly. Now these suckies are going to burn the stock to penny land and there some sad MF on Stocktwits that are sucking the hopium harder than I ever could.

Shipping rates going to $500 Q1 2023 for spot rates. Amazon can‚Äôt even fill up their own cargo planes.. anyone that thinks their juicy dividend is worth it? It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a variable rate and they are going to slash it to penny land next year.

Finally,

This is what I‚Äôm going in moving forward.

FUTURE PREDICTIONS:
In 1998, Kodak had 170,000 employees and sold 85% of all photo paper worldwide.  Within just a few years, their business model disappeared and they went bankrupt. What happened to Kodak will happen in a lot of industries in the next 10 years - and most people don't see it coming. Did you think in 1998 that 3 years later you would never take pictures on paper film again? Yet digital cameras were invented in 1975. The first ones only had 10,000 pixels, but followed Moore's law. So as with all exponential technologies, it was a disappointment for a long time, before it became way superior and got mainstream in only a few short years. It will now happen with Artificial Intelligence, health, autonomous and electric cars, education, 3D printing, agriculture and jobs. Welcome to the 4th Industrial Revolution. Welcome to the Exponential Age.

Software will disrupt most traditional industries in the next 5-10 years.
Uber is just a software tool, they don't own any cars, and are now the biggest taxi company in the world. Airbnb is now the biggest hotel company in the world, although they don't own any properties.

Artificial Intelligence: Computers become exponentially better in understanding the world. This year, a computer beat the best Go player in the world, 10 years earlier than expected. In the US, young lawyers already don't get jobs. Because of IBM Watson, you can get legal advice (so far for more or less basic stuff) within seconds, with 90% accuracy compared with 70% accuracy when done by humans. So if you study law, stop immediately. There will be 90% fewer lawyers in the future, only specialists will remain. Watson already helps nurses diagnosing cancer, 4 time more accurate than human nurses. Facebook now has a pattern recognition software that can recognize faces better than humans. By 2030, computers will become more intelligent than humans.

Autonomous Cars: In 2018 the first self-driving cars will appear for the public. Around 2020, the complete industry will start to be disrupted. You don't want to own a car anymore. You will call a car with your phone, it will show up at your location and drive you to your destination. You will not need to park it, you only pay for the driven distance and can be productive while driving. Our kids will never get a driver's license and will never own a car. It will change the cities, because we will need 90-95% fewer cars for that. We can transform former parking space into parks. 1.2 million people die each year in car accidents worldwide. We now have one accident every 100,000 km, with autonomous driving that will drop to one accident in 10 million km. That will save a million lives each year.

Most car companies may become bankrupt. Traditional car companies try the evolutionary approach and just build a better car, while tech companies (Tesla, Apple, Google) will do the revolutionary approach and build a computer on wheels. I spoke to a lot of engineers from Volkswagen and Audi; they are completely terrified of Tesla. 

Insurance Companies will have massive trouble because without accidents, the insurance will become 100x cheaper. Their car insurance business model will disappear.

Real estate will change. Because if you can work while you commute, people will move further away to live in a more beautiful neighborhood.

Electric cars won‚Äôt become mainstream until 2020. Cities will be less noisy because all cars will run on electric. Electricity will become incredibly cheap and clean: Solar production has been on an exponential curve for 30 years, but you can only now see the impact. Last year, more solar energy was installed worldwide than fossil. The price for solar will drop so much that all coal companies will be out of business by 2025.

With cheap electricity comes cheap and abundant water. Desalination now only needs 2kWh per cubic meter. We don't have scarce water in most places, we only have scarce drinking water. Imagine what will be possible if anyone can have as much clean water as he wants, for nearly no cost.

Health:  There will be companies that will build a medical device (called the ""Tricorder"" from Star Trek) that works with your phone, which takes your retina scan, your blood sample and you breathe into it. It then analyses 54 biomarkers that will identify nearly any disease. It will be cheap, so in a few years everyone on this planet will have access to world class medicine, nearly for free.

3D printing: The price of the cheapest 3D printer came down from $18,000 to $400 within 10 years. In the same time, it became 100 times faster. All major shoe companies started 3D printing shoes. Spare airplane parts are already 3D printed in remote airports. The space station now has a printer that eliminates the need for the large number of spare parts they used to have in the past.

At the end of this year, new smart phones will have 3D scanning possibilities. You can then 3D scan your feet and print your perfect shoe at home. In China, they already 3D printed a complete 6-storey office building. By 2027, 10% of everything that's being produced will be 3D printed. 

Business Opportunities: If you think of a niche you want to go in, ask yourself: ""in the future, do you think we will have that?"" and if the answer is yes, how can you make that happen sooner? If it doesn't work with your phone, forget the idea. And any idea designed for success in the 20th century is doomed in to failure in the 21st century.

Work: 70-80% of jobs will disappear in the next 20 years. There will be a lot of new jobs, but it is not clear if there will be enough new jobs in such a small time.

Agriculture: There will be a $100 agricultural robot in the future. Farmers in 3rd world countries can then become managers of their field instead of working all days on their fields. Agroponics will need much less water. The first Petri dish produced veal is now available and will be cheaper than cow-produced veal in 2018. Right now, 30% of all agricultural surfaces is used for cows. Imagine if we don't need that space anymore. There are several startups that will bring insect protein to the market shortly. It contains more protein than meat. It will be labeled as ""alternative protein source"" (because most people still reject the idea of eating insects).

There is an app called ""moodies"" which can already tell in which mood you are. Until 2020 there will be apps that can tell by your facial expressions if you are lying. Imagine a political debate where it's being displayed when they are telling the truth and when not.

Bitcoin will become mainstream this year and might even become the default reserve currency. 

Longevity: Right now, the average life span increases by 3 months per year. Four years ago, the life span used to be 79 years, now it's 80 years. The increase itself is increasing and by 2036, there will be more than one year increase per year. So we all might live for a long long time, probably way more than 100.

Education: The cheapest smart phones are already at $10 in Africa and Asia. Until 2020, 70% of all humans will own a smart phone. That means, everyone has the same access to world class education.

3763,wallstreetbets,"Some of the bagholders will not like reading this, but Elon hype is dead, it's over. I am sorry but this is it. You know how stockmarket works, once a hype is gone it's gone. Nobody will ever believe him again. Even if he goes to Mars now, or sends 100 tesla to the orbit, doesn't matter. He will be remembered as doge scammer, pump &amp; dumper, liar etc. his ego has taken over his identity and morality.

Look, majority of humans have this weakness that when large amounts of money enter their life, they lose their minds. They become arrogant, power-hungry, lose humility, their very identity and morality. They start to play mini-God and surround themselves with yes-man, and if their mini-God status ever gets challenged, they go mad and not shy away to use illegal ways that they did not use at the beginning of their story.

Just look around you. I am sure you have a couple friends who become rich from a lucky hit on stockmarket, family inheritence or through early bitcoin or some other way. I am not exaggerating, 99% of the time you will see same story happening. The guy that was your best friend years ago that you could argue any subject no longer tolerates to hear you oppose them anymore. He has more money so in his mind he is more ""successful"" so that makes him ""right"" on everything. He no longer seeks friends who tell the truth to their face, he seeks people who admires his supreme intelligence and supreme decisions.

I admired Elon Musk when he had Mars landing presentations etc. people believed he is the new kid on the block with crazy ideas for humanity's progression. I admired Bill Gates before he became the vaccine lord and started to dictate how people should live their lives. I was a Binance user for a long time and I admired CZ. CZ is no longer same person as first time Binance was launched. He has a very similar story like many others that started humble and promising, only to end up as corrupted as any other dictator.

Bottom line is that: Do not over-idolize anyone, not Warren Buffet, not Vitalik etc. anyone I mean anyone regardless of how genius or humble they seem today. Very very few people don't lose their minds when large amounts of money enter their life, and props to those who still keep their feet on the ground. But at the end everyone is just human and prone to same weaknesses. That is why history keeps repeating itself over and over again.

If by chance that you do get rich one day from this capitalism's game of stonks remember where it started and remember who was with you when you had nothing. Having some self principles and self virtues will keep your ego in check and keep your feet on the ground.",Do not over-idolize anyone...,1672195471

#1: everyone is acting like Tesla puts are an automatic money machine. As soon as everyone gets on board with anything in the market, the opposite happens. 

#2: everyone thinks Santa rally isn‚Äôt happening, which once again is exactly when it strikes.

#3: The Tesla price drop that occurred over the past couple weeks is the biggest downward move Tesla has made without a rebound since it‚Äôs all time high. A rebound, even if it‚Äôs only a day or 2 long, is coming. It‚Äôs a matter of when not if.

#4: I‚Äôm going to medical school in a few months and the chance at paying off a year of loans is more appealing than the $6000 sitting in my Robinhood account.

Here we have the prices as of today 12/27 of optimized extreme bear plays for June 2023 for those above tickers. I plan to reference back to these throughout the year. I want to wait personally until the week of January 9th to open any long plays. For me I still believe that Apple, Msft, and Google are the best play. However, I honestly worry about how strong MSFT is and that it could actually hold up the best in a long drawdown.   
 

If I had to pick right now I would get SPY, Apple, Google and maybe Amazon puts. Netflix, adbe, nvidia are just too price already. And despite the probable Tesla downfall I wouldn‚Äôt buy it without some sort of 20-30% relief bounce first.

Well SPY continues to be hella frustrating‚Ä¶ Last week I mentioned with the daily 8ema rejection and break through 378 we should have and were setting up to see a bigger push down to 360-370. However, as you can see put in some really strong support at that 379.6 area and we have not been able to break that down. With that big bounce and breakout with bullish engulfing candle on Friday one would have suspected we were going to see 386-390 today. Even looking at futures overnight which were up 0.7% at one point one would have suspected a bigger move up today. 

However, we found that 383 actually was a very strong resistance area that we couldn‚Äôt quite break through. Taking a look at this chart we have a generalized range of 379.6 to 386.3. however, when we look at the last 5 trading days besides December 21st we actually have a tighter range of 383 to 379.6. Todays hanging man candle actually formed a nice triple top at 383 too. Depending on the structure of tomorrows candle we could also turn this into a evening doji star pattern (bearish pattern). 

I have referenced my favorite diamond pattern many times before. This is about as tight of a diamond pattern as we could get (futes has it too). The way I see it that we either open over the blue support line of 382.2 (+0.2%) or we open under the red resistance line of 380.4 (-0.3%). I expect tomorrow to (and overnight) to establish the next 2-3 day move on SPY. 

If we break the blue support line then we are likely to see 378 retested and if that fails im looking at 370.6 by EOW Friday. 

If we breakout through the red resistance line (and more importantly the daily 8ema) then I will be eyeing a 386 to 390 retest by EOW.

Taking a look at Futures we are in the exact same pattern as SPY daily. This nice big diamond pattern here. With this opening of the futures daily candle we have officially broken the support of the diamond pattern. Key resistance of this pattern is 3872.  

I am eyeing next key consolidation level of 3845. We have bounced off this 3840 to 3850 support area 6 times in a row now. It is a very strong support area. If we lose that support its going to signal a pretty strong downturn. 3805 is the next major support. 

Resistance is at 3880 and 3920.

With tesla losing 111.4 weekly support. Next major levels I have are 94.4 and 60.7. Full on death to tesla is 27.8 which on current weekly trajectory we could be there by January 2024.

I really wish tesla would have one big meaningful bounce so that I could trust entering some puts on it. I just cant in good conscious despite how puts for the last  month were free money on tesla‚Ä¶ buy a put at these levels. But I also think buying a call is straight wasting money. I mentioned based on trend that we might get a 4th red week on Tesla before 1-2 weeks of consolidation.

The VIX continues to be absolutely detached from reality. IT appears to be a trend now that we get a pretty impressive spike on the VIX over night and then pretty much from 10am till 2pm we see the VIX unwind every day which then pushes us up. 

There are some impressive wicks to the upside on the VIX. We did close back over the daily 8ema support but once again failed to close over the daily 20ema. 

Market wise (as in price action and technical on SPY) I would favor a break down to 370 this week vs. a breakout to 390 this week. However, the VIX tells a more bullish story. However, I personally and maybe this actually is a 0dte everyday issue am seeing the VIX either being artificially suppressed or we are seeing the new calculation of the VIX with these 0dte everday being impossible to follow.

Tesla sold -11.4% Today on 200 million volume

I wrote up an AutoNation post back in October on some other subs. I have since deleted that account, but wanted to repost the summary of my view.

\-Car Market is in decline due to rising interest rates.

\-Twitter Guru CarDealershipGuy sharing info on rising default rates and suspect lending strategies from current lenders.

\-Massive Insider Selling

source: Nasdaq.com.

\-One of the few Dealerships that hasn't already tanked 50+% (has stayed in the channel of $100-$130)

\-Carmax (KMX) just had a dismal earnings, and yet AutoNation still holding up.

\-Revenue for AN has continued to reach record highs the past few quarters, despite total car sales decreasing. Margin crunch coming.

Positions: Holding 4 puts ($100-105, Jan-May), will continue adding more if it approaches 120 again.

Anyway, I felt the need to create a new post because every other thread I see is some $TSLA bag holding bozo trying to figure out at what price level they should buy more shares and be impaled by the falling knife that is Tesla's stock price.

Unless you get incredibly lucky, buy the bottom, catch an aggressive bounce that is bound to happen sometime in the next few weeks and then actually take profits, I'm here to tell you it is my opinion that it doesn't matter where you buy because this stocks best days are behind it.

Tesla will be a successful functioning company going forward, but it's my opinion, just like $CSCO in 2000, $TSLA will underperform the S&amp;P in the short and long term.

 ‚ÄúThe housing market was very overheated for a couple of years after the  pandemic, as demand increased and rates were low. The market needs to  get back into a balance between supply and demand.‚Äù 

 ‚ÄúFor the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better  aligned so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level, at a  reasonable pace, and that people can afford houses again,‚Äù Powell said  after September‚Äôs Fed meeting. ‚ÄúWe in the housing market probably have  to go through a correction to get back to that place.‚Äù 

USA

Fed will continue to raise rates at a moderate pace. I think we all know a pivot is off the table and J Powell said he wants a correction in the housing market. The US will ultimately sink into a recession by Q1 or Q2. This will mean a lot less houses are being build from higher mortgages and a lot less new construction overall.

All South American countries are dealing with high double digit inflation, very little prospects for growth in 2023. 

China

Their housing market is in complete collapse. They recently came out and said housing is for living not speculation. Would be shocked if there was any new construction in China next year.

3999,wallstreetbets," I figured it out but its too late to take advantage and I don't have any money to buy puts. CBA doing a whole DD but here it is. Tesla will never get approval of full self driving without lidar, Tesla vision system has to many weaknesses including night time driving( the most beneficial advantage of self driving imo) BYD is already releasing night time self driving taxies already... With new technologies the regulators move slow and go the safest way. Elon knows this that's why he wanted to sell shares... he didn't really want twitter he wanted and excuse to take out money of Tesla, he knows when people realize they are going to sue and get all that automated driving fees back... I could write a more detail summary of my research that would be much easier for you guys to comprehend but CBA. Use your common sense why would regulators every let out self driving when they know there is a tool that would make it way safer and reliable... multiple companies have already achieve autonomous level 4 already// i think someone whistleblower this and that's why all the big guys are dumping tesla.. I'M PROBABLY WRONG! JUST RANDOM THOUGHT CAME TO HEAD, NO WAY THEY ARE RELEASING SELF DRIVING WITH THE MOST SAFEST MEASURES...",Elon musk self driving Ponzi,1672172027

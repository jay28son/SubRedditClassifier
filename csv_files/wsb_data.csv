I analyzed the Uber chart for example. As you can see in the orange line, things went down. Then following the red line, things started going up. I don't really like the color red so I was excited to see a blue line, and it's pointing down. That's exactly how I know Uber and the whole market will go down. Uber will close trading between 31.00 - 30.50 before earnings, have a bad earnings and drop.

I will be buying Puts on Monday and encourage you to decide whether you want to make money or lose money. I know what I'm talking about and just absolutely knew that Apple would rise after their earnings. I have a portfolio that has been growing steadily over time (as shown in my graphic).

We all know April 2021 saw a massive squeeze on MVIS. It was massively shorted and a lot of covering took place at that time, reaching a high of $31 in premarket at its peak, fuelled in part by WSB so well done to you all!! Fast forward nearly 2 years and it‚Äôs clear that MVIS has grown up and as they said at CES, MVIS is ready NOW!!

Developments since April 2021 include:

*Mavis has continually been shorted, with trades hidden in dark pools. It‚Äôs getting worse by the week. 

*MVIS have a cash runway right now that will last until the end of 2024. They have no debt and a low cash burn compared to the other LiDAR companies. 

*They have just acquired Ibeo and 2023 will see MVIS achieve their highest revenue, including a chunk from MSFT who altered their reporting methods in Q3 so revenue from recent Hololens 2 sales and the IVAS units haven‚Äôt shown on MVIS books yet!

*MVIS was the first of 3 LiDAR companies chosen to be part of the FKA consortium set up to define LiDAR standards. 

*MVIS launched Mavin DR LiDAR last year. Initially in a uniform rectangular black casing, this was then changed to what was described as an ‚ÄúOEM friendly‚Äù white casing which had a very specific and unusual shape to it unlike the black casing. It has a slim profile and can mount neatly behind a car windscreen.  When this converts to being made with an ASIC inside, the unit will be an even smaller form factor and it has an aperture window less than 14mm tall! More about this later!

*Mavin works at 80mph, in bright sunshine and thrives at night, and in rain and can even see puddles on the road. It suffers no interference from other cars. None of this only up to 37mph on a dry straight road in daytime if you have a car that‚Äôs close enough to you nonsense that you‚Äôll get with the inferior one that Mercedes is currently using! MVIS is the real deal. 

*Mavin works at 30hz, better than anything else out there. No other point cloud comes close to this!

*Mavin uses 905nm so it is a cost effective and scalable solution for OEMs.

*Mavin is now available to OEMs via the NVDA platform as of Sept 2022.

*MVIS coincidentally gained a new board member - Jeff Herbst who spent 20 years working at NVDA in M&amp;A. 

*Sumit said that when everything was as the OEMs wanted it, the design would be locked in and they would get it certified. At the end of September 22 Mavin was confirmed as being independently certified as class 1 safe for eyes. With another patent thrown in for good luck! (They have 700 patents now that the Ibeo ones get added to the pile)

*MVIS do not have any more milestones to achieve, next stop is sales! They will demo the Ibeo software with the Mavin LiDAR very soon and it really is loading up time now!

*MVIS have been dealing with at least 1 OEM since 2019, and they mentioned they were sitting on orders for sample sales in July‚Äôs earnings call. They shipped orders from the end of September. They quoted one OEM as saying ‚ÄúMavin is the best LiDAR product they have ever seen‚Äù. Sumit‚Äôs character is that of a very humble man, but he does not believe there is any competition and he does not think there is a single LiDAR out there that comes close to Mavin. He said that this will be as big and disruptive as the creation of the internet. 

*October 2021 Sumit took part in an interview with Joanna Makris, where he said that they would need an order of 1.2-1.5 million units to justify ASIC production. They have since recruited ASIC experts, who are now working on the digital and analog ASICs, which suggests they are expecting deals imminently!

*The MVIS executive bonus scheme rewards them for the share price reaching levels between $12 and $36.00. So a 10 bagger if it just goes to $36 and $36 is NOT THE CEILING!!! Their investor slides contained projections based on them taking between a 15%-40% share of the market.     Anubhav has said the purchase of Ibeo adds significant upside to their original projections.

*They have conditions in their contracts to lay out what happens if there is a change of control - including a trigger if the company that buys them out is based beyond a certain distance from their office.  

*In January 2022 the CFO Anubhav Verma said that he expects the industry darling (which they obviously believe will be MVIS) to be bought out within 18-24 months. That‚Äôs a timeframe of July 2023-January 2024.  This suggests multiple high volume series production deals are expected to be signed over the coming months to support a big rise in the share price and to enable a buy out at an acceptable level. They have recently said that ZF is a likely contender to buy them out. They intend to use ZF as their manufacturing tier 1. ZF are one of the biggest tier 1s in the world and they have a history of acquisitions. But it could turn into a bidding war as Anubhav has also said a chip company might be a prospective contender too. They all have very deep pockets.

Their business model includes an amount they will receive for the hardware and a fixed price software fee per unit sold (that will not reduce over time) and they will be valued in line with software company multipliers.  A recent example of this is Adobe buying Figma at $20 billion. 50 times their annual revenue of $400 million! A $20
billion buy out for MVIS would put the share price in the region of $120 per share. Thanks to those shorting MVIS you can buy a share now for $3.xx! They would need to sell approx 2.6 millon units per year to achieve an annual revenue of $400 million (based on them splitting the $500-$800 revenue per unit with a tier 1 and very conservatively estimating that MVIS‚Äôs share is only $150 per unit). MVIS‚Äôs share of revenue will be mostly profit as they are taking on zero manufacturing expense or risk. Their January 2022 projections were for them to sell at least 30 million units to 2+ OEMS by 2030. That‚Äôs significantly more than 2.6 million units per year.  Which means the share price could be greater than $120‚Ä¶.and bearing in mind multiple deals must be coming very soon for Anubhav to believe a reasonable buy out time line for maximum shareholder value is July 2023 to Jan 2024!  Zero milestones stand in the way of units being sold right now. 

In addition there is the ongoing income from the Microsoft Hololens 2 which only exists because of MVIS tech! MVIS tech is also believed to be in the IVAS headsets for the US army as part of a $22 billion contract.  The MSFT contract runs out in December so MSFT need to either sign a new contract (which will be on more favourable terms for MVIS) or MSFT buy the vertical for a fair price. One thing is for sure, MSFT cannot honour the army contract without MVIS licensing the tech to them!

Many AR patents from the goliaths have appeared that mention LBS and MVIS. Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are all working on headsets and smart glasses. Sumit said that  MVIS tech will absolutely be a part of any smart glasses that make it to the market. Sumit said that the big players all know MVIS and they are ready and waiting when the goliaths complete their product development. 

In addition to this they have a HUD vertical which they have a contract with Sharp Foxconn - who just happen to have a deal to provide a car infotainment centre to cars for Stellantis‚Ä¶read into that what you want!

In addition to this they have an interactive display vertical that could appear in a smart home device in the future.

In addition to this their LiDAR can be incorporated into consumer home security devices, and they are developing channels for other uses for their LiDAR. 

There really isn‚Äôt any competition. The last year has got rid of lots of inferior companies. Cep are clinging on thanks to a $100 million bail out but their latest model won‚Äôt even have software for another 12 months. Velo and Ous are merging and have given up aiming for the main automotive market and trying to survive on deals in other areas. Luminar makes a car look like a taxi and are at least twice the cost of MVIS‚Äôs LiDAR . Innoviz is chunky and can only go in the grill. It‚Äôs an accepted fact that the higher up the car the better. Oh and Innoviz failed to deliver to BMW who have been selling cars with an empty space where the LiDAR should be. There are others like the new bosch one, but the point cloud is poor and it is chunky, in short there simply are no LiDARs out there with a better spec/point cloud than the MVIS Mavin and it is so slim it can mount into the seam where the roof meets the windscreen as it‚Äôs aperture window is less than 14mm tall.  No lumps or bumps on the roof, no changing the car design or aerodynamics, just a discreet little window cut into that seam. 

There‚Äôs no doubt as to what will be the favourite LiDAR for OEMs moving forward. 

I‚Äôve done so much reading up on this and I have zero doubt this could go to $100+ as long as the buyout doesn‚Äôt cut that journey short. As a minimum I can‚Äôt see a buy out happening below the $36 level to tie in with their bonus scheme. 

Then factor in that despite all of the above, MVIS is ridiculously shorted. Institutions are increasing their holdings. Blackrock have just filed that they now own 7.9% of MVIS - 13 million shares. MVIS retail shareholders keep buying the dips, no one is selling. We all know what we own and what it will be worth! 

It‚Äôs going to be one hell of a ride from now and anyone jumping in now is getting it at a great price. The LiDAR market is projected to be worth $80 billion by 2030. Never mind what the AR market will be worth. There is so much cash sitting out of the market at the moment, the FOMO will be out of this world when the LiDAR deals roll in. Which they will, the writing is on the wall,  as Sumit himself has said ‚Äúit‚Äôs inevitable‚Äù.

Now if you at this website, you can see the contract name

ZQK2023 = May fed funds futures

ZQM2023 = June Fed funds futures

ZQN2023= July Fed funds futures

ZQU2023 = September Fed funds futures

ZQX2023= November Fed funds futures

ZQZ2023 = December Fed funds futures

and I want to know how the March contracts will differ from the December contract I can input this formula into Trading view

ZQH2023 - QZQ2023 and type that into the search bar

Here's what I typed in the search bar: [What to put into trading view](https://i.postimg.cc/DwJsfPJj/image.png)

Now here's how you can see the effect of the jobs data that came out on Friday:

[Fed Funds futures showing fridays jobs data](https://i.postimg.cc/yNKdqmFS/image.png)

So notice how before the jobs data this was about -.25 

This implies that the rates from march would be .25 less in December.

But notice that massive green bar that is now showing .04

This implies that rates in March will be the same as rates in December after that data drop.

My intention for this thread is to expose people to a great trade on the market and an awesome company that deserves more recognition. I also want to present my first DD in a well formatted thread. I hope you enjoy the read!

But I can't believe I wasted a Sunday on you fucks. If you want to pay me back for writing all this up, then just pay it forward and do something nice for someone else.

Now let's get down to business. It's been 3 months since we last talked about Microvision ($MVIS). Our market cap fell below $500 million, but a lot of fuckin great things have taken place since the last MVIS DD was posted to WSB. Buckle up for this trip. I'm about to blow your fuckin mind. Here is a summary recap of everything we got going on:

MicroVision, Inc. engages in the development of *laser beam scanning* technology. It integrates **micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS)**, lasers, optics, hardware, algorithms and machine learning software into its proprietary technology to address existing and emerging markets.

# 1st vertical: Lidar (specifically automotive lidar) (MAVIN by MVIS)

* It uses its technology (software &amp; hardware) to develop automotive lidar sensors and provide solutions for advanced driver-assisted systems (ADAS).
* Driving automation will most likely require multiple types of sensors (cameras, lidar, radar, sonar). A pure vision only system will never reach the highest [levels of driving automation](https://blog.rgbsi.com/6-levels-of-driving-automation#:~:text=Automation%20driving%20technology%3A%20artificial%20intelligence%20%28AI%29%20technology%20that,represents%20no%20automation%20and%205%20represents%20full%20automation.).
* This is due to compliance and government regulations set by [NHTSA | National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://www.nhtsa.gov/). (Sorry, but I think Tesla might be in trouble with the government).
* MVIS literally have the best automobile lidar product on the market, and no one can really compete with them. Can't stress this enough. MVIS has existed for a long time, and they have a **MOAT of patents around MEMs based technology.**
* MVIS will claim at least 40% of the global automotive lidar market!
* MVIS recently required ibeo and now have connections to ZF (tier 1 OEM supplier). Meaning they have inside sales channel to major automobile OEMs.
* They are shipping samples of their lidar to major OEMs and waiting on RFQs. Revenue will be hitting the books soon!
* Here is a powerpoint from the company that dives deeper into this vertical: [MVIS automobile lidar Presentation](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_7a02af86a4ea9978137ec22feeee7c7c/microvision/db/1086/9886/pdf/MVIS+investor+presentation+final+01.03.22.pdf)

# 2nd vertical: Augmented reality

* MVIS also develops micro-display concepts and designs for head-mounted augmented reality (AR) headsets, as well as 1440i MEMS module that can support AR headsets
* MVIS has a miracle light engine display based off MEMs technology.
* This is currently being used in Microsoft's Hololens Product: [Microsoft's Hololens Product](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/mixed-reality-blog/microsoft-committed-to-hololens-2-and-mixed-reality/ba-p/3732405).
* Microsoft has a **$22b contract with US Army to develop Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS).**
* IVAS uses MVIS's miracle light engine. Microsoft is fucked on the contract without MVIS!
* A lot of FUD around IVAS. Congress is not halting funds to it. [Microsoft‚Äôs Deal To Develop IVAS 1.2 Worth $125 Million, Army Aims To Field In FY ‚Äò25](https://www.defensedaily.com/microsofts-deal-to-develop-ivas-1-2-worth-125-million-army-aims-to-field-in-fy-25/army/)
* Rumors of a buyout have existed for quite some time. This rumor coupled with the meme stock run is what caused the squeeze last time.
* MVIS is always quiet about this vertical.... strangely quiet.

# Market forces and mechanics:

* Lidar market has consolidated and MVIS stands strong.
* Oddly enough MVIS got looped in with the ""meme"" stocks. It squeezed but now its bottomed out. Great time to enter a position.
* A lot of the folks over at the MVIS subreddit mutually agree that MVIS has been shorted like crazy. There is a strong possibly connection/correlation with MVIS share price and other ""meme"" stocks.
* There is a strong potential that MVIS will squeeze. If MVIS does squeeze, I hypothesize that other ""meme"" stock will also see a rise in their share price.
* Volume is slowly returning.
* Volatility is still pretty low.
* Compared to the market leader in the lidar sector, MVIS is undervalued!

# Technical analysis:

[Massive Bull Flag formed using LOG chart](https://preview.redd.it/ijlai4htafga1.png?width=1814&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=66f4bd1129f294fde69f7e0979c80140d63104c9)

* Microvision has formed a HISTORIC sized bull flag and had a confirmed breakout last week.
* **MicroVision could be looking at a run to $574.60 within the next few months or year!**
* Chart is LOG chart. LOG charts are used for looking at long time frames &amp; for massive percent movers
* The zoomed in chart will show you the bull flag and how BEAUTIFUL it has formed and where the vertex is located. 

# Trading Strategies:

* Any bullish strategy will work. Just choose one that works with your financials.
* Accumulating and holding shares is a safe bet. Coupled with DCAing will have the lowest risk and a decent payout. You can also get a lower tax rate if you hold for more than a year.
* LEAPs are a good idea but have more risk to them. Just make sure you buy contracts with a far out enough expiration date.
* Day/option traders just need to wait for the volume and volatility to make some decent swing trades.

# Conclusion:

* **The company has incentive plans for the C-suite that is fully granted at $36 /share by '25, and that price must be sustained for at least 20 days.**
* Really good trade on the market that is has a lot of deep value that is about to be recognized.
* Current price is only around $3.25! Get in while it's still cheap!

 The better-than-expected financial report has caused Tesla to rise by 40% in six days, and it has also made the former ‚Äúbig fan‚Äù Morgan Stanley change his mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the release of its results this week, Tesla's stock price has continued to rise sharply. The stock price is now more than 70% higher than the recent low a few weeks ago, it was the best weekly performance since May 2013. 

&amp;#x200B;

 In the past year, Tesla has fallen by more than 70% from its peak, which makes any better-than-expected news likely to push the stock price sharply higher.

 The financial report shows that Tesla‚Äôs operating income in the fourth quarter hit a record high for two consecutive months, and its operating profit and net profit also hit a record high in a single quarter. Both revenue and profit were higher than Wall Street‚Äôs expectations: 

&amp;#x200B;

In the fourth quarter, operating income was US$24.318 billion, a year-on-year increase of 37%; adjusted net profit was US$4.106 billion, a year-on-year increase of 43%, setting a new high in the first quarter; and earnings per share reached US$1.19, a year-on-year increase of 40%.

 Amid growing market skepticism about the auto industry, Tesla posted a stronger-than-expected profit, sending a strong signal.

 ""Big fans"" return

 After Tesla announced better-than-expected performance data, more than half of Wall Street analysts turned to sing more, and Morgan Stanley, which originally ""supported"" Tesla most, was no exception.

 Morgan Stanley auto chief Adam Jonas said in a note yesterday that he chose Tesla as his ""top pick"" and set a price target of $220:

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm not so sure about this.  While we reiterate Tesla as our top pick with a target price of $220, coupled with ongoing macro and geopolitical uncertainty, we see FY23 as the year auto price inflation turns deflationary.

&amp;#x200B;

 There is also the ever-present background risk for Tesla of ""company-specific"" idiosyncratic and sentiment-related factors that can also keep the company swinging in either direction.

&amp;#x200B;

 Across the broad range of outcomes, we could see Tesla testing new lows in the first half before bouncing back above $220.

 Adam Jonas also expressed concern about margin compression due to Tesla's price cuts:

 As we pointed out this week, while earnings are trending well, it comes at the expense of margins: Tesla's auto gross margin was 25.9% in Q4, down a whopping 466bps from 30.6%, and it didn't hit the expected 28.4%.

 The sharp drop in margins likely has something to do with the company's quiet price cuts and still-rising commodity costs.  The decline in automotive gross margins also hit overall gross margins, which fell to 23.8% from 27.4% in the year-ago period and also missed expectations for 25.4%.

 After Tesla's results, about 64% of analysts rated the company's stock as a ""buy"" rating, with an average target price of about $206 per share.  That's the highest ratio of buy ratings Tesla has ever seen, compared with an average of about 58% for the S&amp;P 500, according to FactSet.

 Although analysts have all warned of Tesla's declining profit margins, some analysts believe that this will help Tesla win in the competition in the same industry.

 I think:

 While in the short term, Tesla is sacrificing margins for higher sales, we think this is a smart move to build a customer base against growing EV competition from Detroit (traditional auto industry in the US) and Europe","A violent rally of 40% in 6 days!

185,wallstreetbets,"To begin well examine what the point of engaging in the stock market. Don‚Äôt be mistaken, to engage in the stock market is to engage in war. To engage in a battle between you and those outside of yourself. Mutual combat of the mind between you and the world. And as a retail trader, this battle is one you fight alone. Sure, sometimes you can have mutually beneficial relationships like with Game(stop). But when you lose money, it is only you who loses it. Not redditor #24925, not #59546. You. When you sold your Game(stop) shares at the top to another redditor on your ‚Äúsqueeze team‚Äù, he got left holding your bags and you ran off with his hours of hard labor quantified in dollars. There was no Game(stop) fund in which you all shared your plunder together, with the winners and losers or ‚Äúthe team‚Äù. You won or lost alone. Because at the end of the day, when the market closes there is ‚Äúyou‚Äù and then there is ‚Äúthem‚Äù. Someone‚Äôs going to lose, someone‚Äôs going to win. So, admit it or not, like it or not, this game is one you play, win or lose, alone. A game of 1 versus all. A free-for-all. The last man standing. With this understood, we can understand why we engage in the stock market, this game of mental chess. We play to win, and in a game with no teammates, we play to beat everyone that is not ourselves. We are plunderers of our neighbors wealth. This is the truth of the stock market. Sure we can hope that we buy shares cheap, and then sell it at a higher price to someone that might be able to get more value from it. A win-win. But the truth is, if we thought there was more value to be had we wouldn‚Äôt have sold it in the first place. So again, we play this game to win, over everyone that is not ourselves. With that in mind i‚Äôll explain why the squeeze on Silvergate is a pro-move in squeeze-warfare, regardless of your ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù.

Silvergate ($SI). The most hated, and most **shorted stock** on the market. With 77% shares short, the majority in the [$30 range](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FoLiPqbaQAAVbFO?format=jpg&amp;name=medium)
(majority of shorts not yet feeling the pain) this stock is begging to be sqoze. Now morally, one might say ‚ÄúI would never squeeze those shorts, they‚Äôre the good guys!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôd never help that stock! They‚Äôre the bad guys!‚Äù but this is an infantile understanding of the stock market. It shows that the thinker has yet to understand the game he plays, a game where there are no good guys or bad guys, there are no teammates. Only winners and losers. Those who ride the coming wave to prosperity and those who get left behind. One thing has been clear in my time investing, when you invest with your emotions, you‚Äôre going to get burned and probably miss a lot highly profitable opportunities in the meantime. Just recently i saw this, when META dropped to five year lows. I talked to a few friends of mine and some online sides and told them now was the time to buy this stock, to not let this chance go to waste. That this was at the very least a short-term deal, a bet weighted in their favor. However because of METAs reputation they refused. They jbested with their feelings instead of following the facts. The facts that a highly profitable company with next to no debt and a boat load of cash was historically undervalued. Now, my position is up 95% and they‚Äôre kicking themselves in the ass for not doing the same.

It‚Äôs with this same mindset that i argue one should buy Silvergate. Emotions aside this play is one that could prove immensely profitable to the unemotional investor. Now i‚Äôm not telling one to buy and hold, or that this is a great company, only that $SI‚Äôs extremely large short interest makes it a prime candidate to make money. After all that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre all here to do. Make money. 77% of $SIs shares are shorted, another 30% being held likely long-term by massive hedge funds. That leaves less than 10% of $SI shares to go around. To be re-bought to cover shorts, over the $30 range (another 20% gain before shorts even consider covering). This is why they have been panic posting on every investing sun there is. Are they good guys? Maybe. Is it my fault they found themselves on the side of a very bad play? No. Not at all. They made a very unwise move. They over-piled into a short on the side of a very vulnerable majority. To put it simply, **these shorts f‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ed up.** And it‚Äôs not immoral to squeeze them for it, nor is anyone righteous for not squeezing them for it. After all these shorts borrowed shares from someone that was likely innocent investor just like them and lowered the price of that investors investment. These shorts aren‚Äôt ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù they‚Äôre simply the competition, just like the guy they borrowed shares form was their competition. Collateral damage in our game or war. Well in this game of war these shorts screwed up. They found themselves in an over-shorted stock and now it‚Äôs your job to make money from that bad chess-move. It‚Äôs that simple. You can use this opportunity to win against your opponent, an opponent that wouldn‚Äôt and **didnt** think twice when doing the same thing to other investors, or you can invest with your emotions, miss out on a highly profitable opportunity and let virtue-signaling hypocrites get rich without being punished for playing the game badly. 

Your choice. This stock **is** going to get squeezed. The big boys are not going to look at this opportunity and let it slide. This is a smart money play and the shorts know it. They made a mistake and over-shorted this stock and now they‚Äôre going to pay for it. The question is, are you going to make money from it, lie they would from you, or are you going to just watch from the sidelines when you could‚Äôve had an easy victory?

Two years ago the stockmarket was in the grip of speculative mania. Shares in GameStop, a struggling video-game retailer, hit an all-time intraday high of $483 on January 28th 2021, up from around $5 at the beginning of the month. Retail traders co-ordinated in a Reddit forum and snapped up shares using brokerage apps like Robinhood. Empowered by technology, newcomers piled into GameStop, ostensibly because the beleaguered chain was one Wall Street had heavily sold short (ie, bet that the firm‚Äôs shares would fall in price). Short-sellers were the villains. When GameStop spiked they lost their shirts. What could be better?

The question at the time was how much of this would endure. Manias are as old as the hills, but this one seemed different: it was enabled by new technology that wasn‚Äôt going anywhere. For a time, the GameStop crew were unstoppable. They pumped up prices for companies that had attracted interest from short-sellers, such as amc, a cinema chain, and Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, a home-goods retailer. Battle-hardened short-sellers, including Andrew Left of Citron, a research firm, threw in the towel. Melvin Capital, a firm that had shorted GameStop, which the Reddit hordes made the cartoon villain of the saga, decided to close its doors in May 2022.

When interest rates are zero the price of a dream can be infinite. Higher rates change the dynamic. Last year was therefore rough on the meme-portfolio, but its fans are nothing if not resilient, even when making losses. Matthias Hanauer of Robeco, an asset manager, tracks the most heavily shorted stocks in the msci Developed Index, a benchmark of global shares. Since December 31st 2020, a month before GameStop shares peaked, they have underperformed the market by around 15 percentage points.

If 2022 was a reckoning with professional investors, then 2023 will be a reckoning with reality. A slowing economy is going to break many of the companies meme-stockers profess to adore. Monetary tightening slows the economy with a lag. As conditions worsen, struggling retailers, such as Bed, Bath and Beyond, are floundering. On January 26th the shower-curtain purveyor was served a slew of default notices by its bankers. Reuters, a newswire, has reported it may soon file for bankruptcy.

The end of more than a decade of rock-bottom interest rates is also beginning to reveal corporate misdeeds and sometimes outright fraud. ‚ÄúCapital was free for 12 years,‚Äù says a former Wall Street tycoon. ‚ÄúWe have no idea about all the places capital went that it should not have gone.‚Äù Some initial pockets of misallocation have become apparent. The pricking of the bubble in cryptocurrency markets has exposed businesses including Celsius and ftx, the founders of which have been charged with defrauding their investors.
The stage is therefore set for the triumph of those the meme-stock lot profess to hate most of all: short-sellers, who try to sniff out this sort of stuff. Nathan Anderson, founder of Hindenburg Research and a famed short-seller, has already made quite a splash with an investigation into what he alleges is widespread fraud and market manipulation at the Adani Group, an enormous Indian conglomerate, which strongly denies the claims.

What, then, is left of the retail era? Individual traders are more important than they used to be, even if they are far from the peak of their powers. In 2019 the retail share of stock-trading volumes hovered at around 15%. Then, in the first quarter of 2021, it peaked at 24%. This figure understated the true power of retail investors. Exclude marketmakers, who stand in the middle of most trades, and retail traders made up about half of volumes, with institutional investors accounting for the rest. Although retail traders‚Äô share fell to an average of 18% in 2022, or around one-third excluding marketmakers, this is still above where things started. When the stockmarket rallies, it is faddish favourites, like GameStop and Tesla, leading the charge.

Perhaps what will endure longest, though, is the levity. Investing is normally a serious business. But even as the hold-on-for-dear-life gang let go of their treasures and rethink their old grudges, their influence is still felt. There are already plenty of Hindenburg versus Adani memes on r/WallStreetBets, the Reddit forum where it all began. These echo the ones made about Melvin versus GameStop two years ago, with a small difference. This time Mr Anderson, the short-seller, is the hero.","WallStreetBets back on The Economist - ""The last gasp of the meme-stock era""",1675565112

* ***The revisions also raise the probabilities for a wide range of policy outcomes, including an increase in the magnitude of hikes, an extension of hiking, and the possibility of the next move being up after a Fed pause.***
* ***The updated data shows that if the pace of job gains from January is sustained, a 50bp hike may be firmly on the table for debate.***
* The FOMC statement shifted the focus from the pace of increases to the extent of increases, and Chair Powell suggested that the March Summary of Economic Projections could include a lower path for rates.

I have found many irregularities the video creator and disraptor. I tried point it out via youtube comments but the creator is taking down my comments. I hope I find a safe space here to share my thoughts. My comment goes like this: 

I want to ask the guy in this video if he himself has invested in money thru disraptor? I belive we as public and your viewers deserve an answer. Al ot of people make financial decision based on people the look up to, so it would be awesome if creator can vouch for the company personally. I personally think the video maker is only doing this video for money and enderosement fees from disraptor (which I completely get but legally all the creators are required to mention ""hashtag ad"" when doing promotion). Now, if you look at disraptor's website, it looks very basic and barely has any information on there. Also some sections of the website are ""still under construction"" so how can they claim to be such a big company with so many inside connection to the big TECH and AI companies but their own website looks like trash. Also even if disraptor legit, I think what they are doing is collecting $1000 from everyone and when they have enough funds (lets say $10 million becasue that is what their website mentions about pre-ipo investment fund) they try to buy their own share in the company. And whatever profit is made, majority will be kept by them and only a lil bit of returns will be given to the retail investor. Also they vaguely mention about the risk involved in investing, so if something does go wrong then they are 'not responsible for the money'....so basically they can literally runaway with your money and still wont be held accountable for it. This is another FTX type of scam waiting to come out. WATCH OUT!!!! Also if you go to first pinned comment from the creator of this video, and click on the 17 replies, you see reply from disraptor youtube account. You can clearly see that replies arent consistent and there are errors. Also if you visit their youtube page, they only have a few videos and most of them are on luring people to sign up for disraptor, or just epic games vs. metaverse content. If you visit their website and click on the chat box, after you type your email the chatbox says ""connecting you with someone"" but there is no one on the other side. CONCLUSION: Now I am not saying whether this comapny is scam or not. It might be a legit company at its starting stage. But I am just point out the irregularities that I have came across which makes me DOUBT the legitamacy of the comapany. If the disraptor youtube account reads this comment, I request you shed some light on this whole concept. Also I would love to hear from the maker of this video about his own investment in the company, if he has invested.

303,wallstreetbets,"# A May pause comes into focus, but significant strengthening in the labor market could push rate cuts back to Q1 2024

**Data Preview**  
*Consumer sentiment is likely to reflect recession concerns, while the Manheim used vehicle value index should evidence near-term rising prices for used vehicles.*

**US Economic Outlook**  
With a shallow recession taking hold and inflation gradually easing, we expect the Fed to hike once more in March to 4.75-5.00% before cuts begin Q1 2024.

**Week in a Nutshell**

***Unexpected strength of labor markets may affect highly data-dependent Fed***  
The Fed delivered a widely expected 25bp rate hike and signaled another 25bp rate hike in March. Powell's press conference also stressed the data-dependency of monetary policy while discussing a wide range of topics. This reflects a dovish shift relative to prior messaging for a ‚Äúhigher for longer‚Äù Fed Funds rate. We believe the FOMC is laying the groundwork for a pause; however after unexpected strength in the January employment report, we believe economic conditions will remain too firm for the Fed to cut rates in 2023.We highlight our four key views in response to the meeting and January‚Äôs employment report:

1. A March rate hike seems almost certain.
2. Three more months of softening core inflation will likely motivate a pause in May.
3. Rate cuts are fully dependent upon incoming data and unexpected resilient of the economy will push the timing of rate cuts to 2024.
4. The Fed will not push back on easing financial conditions when they reflect softer inflation forecasts.

Overall, we believe the FOMC meeting adds support to our monetary policy outlook of another 25bp rate hike in March, to a terminal rate of 4.75-5.00%. However, after the upside surprise in the January employment report, we revised our economic outlook and now expect a shallower recession of just two negative real GDP growth in Q1 and Q2 this year versus our prior expectation of four quarters of negative real GDP growth spanning the entirety of 2023. Importantly, we now forecast the unemployment rate will not reach5% until Q1 2024, a level of unemployment at which we believe the Fed will start serious consideration of trade-offs between maximum employment and price stability and thus be open to rate cuts. In addition, the resilience of labor markets will likely slow disinflation of non-housing core service inflation, which is a key metric for assessing the risk of inflation rebounding for the Fed. Taking all into account, we now believe the Fed will hold at terminal until March 2024 (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 ).

https://preview.redd.it/e326d2lrv8ga1.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1d0e6be4406a3a07ed0e099585a69f0e91186bbe

***January employment report shows a very different picture of labor markets***  
We believe the January employment report changed the landscape of labor markets, increasing the possibility of a soft-landing scenario where the economy avoids a severe contraction while inflation/wage growth continues to moderate. Nonfarm payrolls (NFP)jumped strongly by 517k, exceeding expectations (Nomura: 195k Consensus: 188k). Annual revisions also boosted the pace of monthly job gains from June through December, though April and May 2022 were revised lower. The revised monthly profile of NFP suggests labor markets were much stronger in late 2022 than previously reported. The strength in January employment was widespread across industries. This includes temporary help service employment, widely considered as a leading indicator for the broader trend of labor markets, which resumed increasing by 26k in January after having declined in November and December. Aggregate working hours, a gauge of general economic activity, also rebounded strongly after back-to-back monthly declines. Household employment, an alternative measure of job growth, continued to increase strongly by 894k, increasing even after excluding the impact of annual revisions. The unemployment rate unexpectedly inched down to 3.4% from 3.5%. Overall, details of the jobs report pose an upside risk to our economic outlook and reduce the likelihood of a severe recession. However, average hourly earnings (AHE) showed a trend-like increase of 0.3%, reducing y-o-y growth further to 4.4% from 4.8% in December. That suggested the recent decline in short-term inflation expectations is easing wage growth, despite strong labor markets. The combination of robust job growth and moderating wage growth remains consistent with our view that the Fed is still likely to pause rate hikes in May, while monetary easing in the second half is less likely due to the lesser extent of trade-offs between maximum employment and price stability.

***Upcoming data and events***  
The coming week is uncharacteristically quiet in terms of incoming data, but some interesting Fed speak is scheduled. Chair Powell is scheduled to speak at noon EST on 7February, while on 8 February NY Fed President Williams will speak at 9:15am, Governor Cook will take part in a moderated discussion at 9:30am, Atlanta Fed President Bostic will speak at a student event at 10am, Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari will speak at the Boston Economic Club at 12:30, and Governor Waller will discuss the economic outlook at1:45. At the most recent FOMC press conference, Powell highlighted data-dependency; key to monitor will be how he changed his monetary policy outlook after the January employment report. In addition, at his post-FOMC press conference, Chair Powell said the Committee intensively discussed the economic criterion for a pause on rate hikes. Thus, some FOMC participants could elaborate on that topic.

In terms of incoming data, we will have the January final Manheim used vehicle price index on Tuesday. We expect used vehicle prices to rise in the final reading as in the preliminary reading covering the first fifteen days of the month, though we would consider this to be a speed bump in the disinflation trend. Other than that, we will have the Q4senior loan officer opinion survey (SLOOS), which provides banks‚Äô lending standards for a wide variety of loans. In light of the recent easing of financial conditions in financial markets and the Q3 SLOOS, which suggested lending standards were tightening as Fed tightening proceeded, further information on how lending is evolving is of particular importance for the trajectory of spending and fixed investment. Consumer credit will also provide an interesting signal on the borrowing-related outlook for spending, and we expect a deceleration in line with rising savings. Last, the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan survey will be interesting to evaluate to see how multiple conflicting forces, including lower inflation, recession concerns, higher stock prices and higher gasoline prices, will collectively affect consumer sentiment. Also, it‚Äôs important to monitor the survey‚Äôs measure of short-term inflation expectations, as this may signal whether wage growth is likely to continue to decline in February (Fig. 5 ).

***This week‚Äôs data in review***  
In addition to the FOMC meeting and Friday payrolls data, this week provided some key insights on the labor market through JOLTS, the Employment Cost Index (ECI) and Conference Board‚Äôs consumer confidence, confirming that the labor market remained strong but wage inflation continued to moderate, while the ISM manufacturing index provided further evidence of contraction in the sector.

The ECI, the Fed‚Äôs preferred wage inflation measure, showed wage inflation cooling more than expected in Q4 2022, joining a variety of other wage inflation measures showing reducing wage inflation. Excluding benefits and government employment, the y-o-y change in the ECI‚Äôs private wages and salaries continued to decelerate to +5.1% in Q4 from +5.2% inQ3. Excluding also volatile inventive paid occupations, private wages and salaries moderated more noticeably by four-tenths to +5.2% y-o-y in Q4 from +5.6% in Q3. We highlight that the ECI wage inflation in service industries moderated more sharply than in the goods-producing industries. This downside surprise in the ECI and the concentration of this weakness in industries where prices are particularly sensitive to wages implies downward pressure on core services ex-shelter inflation. In terms of wage growth, ADP‚Äôsy-o-y wage growth measure, which also adjusts for the impact from compositional changes of the labor force, held level at 7.3% for job stayers. However, this follows three consecutive months of decreases for this large subset of the workforce, and we do not believe it reflects a notable shifting of the trend of wage disinflation.

JOLTS showed job openings increasing strongly to 11.01mn in December from 10.44mnin November, providing evidence of strength in the labor market over the month. The V-U ratio ‚Äì job openings per unemployed worker ‚Äì jumped to 1.92 in December from 1.74 in November, much higher than the pre-pandemic level of 1.2. However, job openings could be overly optimistic when signaling the strength of labor markets, as businesses might have continued to post openings despite putting a pause on hiring new employees. That being said, gross hiring and quits remained stable in recent months, suggesting that labor markets have not eased materially.

Consumer confidence weakened in January (-1.2 to 107.1), signaling recession concerns may be weighing on the consumer as personal spending falters and savings rates tick up, in line with our view that support from excess savings is waning. The report showed households remaining cautious about the near-term economic outlook, with the share of households expecting more jobs and better business conditions both deteriorating in January. However, the labor differential (the difference in the share of households reporting jobs are ‚Äúplentiful‚Äù minus ‚Äúhard to get) ticked up (+2.4 to 36.9), suggesting labor conditions remain strong even as activity slows.

ISM manufacturing surprised slightly to the downside in January falling 1.0pp to 47.4,showing contraction for a third consecutive month, in line with our view the manufacturing sector has been in a recession for some time. The employment sub-index ticked down (-0.8 to 50.6)towards entering contraction, providing some early evidence of cool labor markets, while new orders fell deeper into contraction territory (-2.7pp to 42.5), suggesting the outlook for the sector will remain soft for some time.

ISM services also surprised to the upside in January, rising 6.0pp to 55.2 (Nomura 49.5,Consensus 50.5), roughly in line with levels seen in November and October before the sharp fall into contraction territory in December. Large increases in new orders (+15.2ppto 60.4) and business activity (+6.9pp to also 60.4) show a sharp rebound in demand, while employment edged up 0.6pp to 50, in line with employment holding level in the sector. Supplier deliveries also edged up (+1.5pp) to 50, also signaling delivery timeliness was level from the prior month, sign of firming demand after flagging demand in December.

*Consumer sentiment is likely to reflect recession concerns, while the Manheim used vehicle value index should evidence near-term rising prices for used vehicles.*

***Trade balance (Tuesday):*** We forecast the December trade deficit to come in at$67.8bn, based on the advance nominal goods figures and our expectations for net trade-in services. This represents some bounce-back following the surprisingly low November trade deficit of $61.5bn. That said, the underlying trend has been a reducing trade deficit as softening domestic demand weakens imports relatively more than exports. However, exports are likely to remain relatively resilient given China‚Äôs reopening and an improving economic outlook for Europe, and we expect this dynamic to continue.

***Manheim used vehicle value index (Tuesday):*** The preliminary January Manheim wholesale used vehicle prices rose 1.5% m-o-m based on the first 15 days of the month. We expect the full-month final reading to remain positive m-o-m. However, we expect this increase to be a speed bump in the medium-term disinflation trend. Lending standards for auto loans continued to tighten and interest rates for car loans remained high, which should weigh on demand for vehicles. Moreover, dealers‚Äô margins (as determined by price differences between wholesale and retail sales) will likely be squeezed, keeping CPI‚Äôs used vehicle prices declining, even if wholesale prices rebound temporarily.

***Consumer credit (Tuesday):*** Data from the Fed on weekly bank lending suggest December consumer credit decelerated from November‚Äôs consumer credit growth of$28.0bn. That said, we would note this signal should be interpreted with caution, as Fed data suggested credit growth was well below actual consumer credit growth in November. This signal suggests a risk that slowing December credit per Fed bank lending data may once again undershoot actual consumer credit growth. However, with the personal savings rate having risen 0.5pp in December, and evidence many consumers are approaching credit constraints while lending standards tighten, we think a deceleration in December consumer credit is likely.

***Jobless claims (Thursday):*** Jobless claims remained persistent over January, however we expect slowing economic activity will soon begin to soften claims. It is possible the backlog of open positions, as evidenced by the V-U ratio rising to 1.92 in December, is keeping claims low as many workers affected by widely covered headcount reductions are reportedly finding new employment before registering for unemployment benefits. However, as the labor market continues to cool, this effect that could be reducing claims should dissipate, and claims are likely to begin to better reflect slowing economic conditions.

***University of Michigan consumer sentiment (Friday):*** We expect the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index to remain relatively unchanged in February following January‚Äôs upside surprise. Recession concerns appear to be weighing on consumers as excess savings become depleted, as evidenced by the conference board‚Äôs weak January consumer confidence index and the uptick in personal savings. This is likely to weigh on sentiment through the interview period, which commences only one day after the end of the January consumer confidence survey period. By contrast, resilient labor markets and higher stock prices could offset the negative impact from recession concerns. Continued media coverage of easing inflation could add some downward pressure to inflation expectations, which remains one of our focal points to monitor for any unexpected resurgence after the recent downward trend.

***US budget (Friday):*** Data from the Daily Treasury statement suggest a budget deficit of around $42bn in January, weakening from a surplus of $119bn in January 2022.

# US Economic Outlook

*With a shallow recession taking hold and inflation gradually easing, we expect the Fed to hike once more in March to 4.75-5.00% before cuts begin March 2024*

***Economic activity:*** Growth momentum is easing despite strength in the labor market, and we expect a recession started in December 2022. Easing financial conditions and a strong labor market are likely to add support to flagging economic activity. As the housing market recession deepens , and an early industrial sector downturn emerges , retail sales and industrial production are flagging , and real income and spending are likely to follow, despite support from labor markets. The pace of contraction may be cushioned by strong balance sheets we expect a shallow recession, followed by a gradual recovery due to alack of both monetary and fiscal policy support. High uncertainty and interest rates will likely continue to weigh on both residential and nonresidential fixed investment. Despite labor market strength , we expect job losses to start in Q2 2023, with an end-2024unemployment rate around 5.3%.

***Inflation:*** Recent data suggest inflationary pressures are gradually faltering . The speed of core goods price declines accelerated and key non-rent core service inflation continued to slow. In addition, rent-related components will likely start to moderate in early 2023based on leading private rent data. Moreover, the expected downturn is beginning to weigh on non-housing core service inflation which is strongly linked to labor markets. Core PCE inflation, the Fed‚Äôs preferred metric, will likely decelerate toward the Fed‚Äôs 2%target on a y-o-y basis by end-2024

***Policy:*** As still-elevated monthly inflation moderates gradually, and after 450bp of tightening, Fed participants are likely to hike once more in March to a 4.75-5.00%terminal rate. A pause is likely until the unemployment rate increases to a point where the Fed reconsiders the tradeoff between inflation risks and job growth, and normalizing core services ex-shelter inflation suggests the risk of inflation rebounding decreases. At that point, we believe the Fed will cut rates by 25bp/meeting, starting in March 2024. We expect the Fed to end balance sheet runoff after March 2024 to avoid working at cross purposes with rate cuts.

***Risks:*** We see risks as balanced. Inflation could slow earlier than expected, but upside risks include more persistent than expected core-services ex-shelter inflation and renewed supply chain disruptions. Fed tightening could weigh on growth more heavily than we assume, but the labor market remaining resilient despite wage inflation moderating poses upside risk;.

Huge gains coming IMO as its only valued at 2.5billion, despite being one of the few American companies that can reach orbit, never mind get their, never mind launching frequently (Rocketlab has the second most launches as a U.S company, first being spacex). Huge things coming in the space race, just thought id give you guys a heads up.

We got a genius Ceo (Peter Beck) who made this company with no billionaire money like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, and Richard Branson, however it is absolutely destroying blue origin and virgin orbit/galactic.

I also believe that Citadel has been executing a majority of its trades by using shares that it does not own, or by taking advantage of failures in the integrity of exchanges.***

**PREFACE**

Since the origination of the US stock exchange in 1792, countless investors have tried their hands at identifying profitable strategies for building their wealth. In the beginning, these strategies were relatively straightforward. First, find a business that you believe in. Next, take your own hard-earned money and extend a show of faith to the business that you believe will generate substantial returns. Then, after years of development and growth, reap the rewards of your faith through returns on your investment.

I believe that, at their core, stock markets are fundamental to any economy. In its purest form, a stock market is a way for economies to establish healthy competition between corporations. It ensures financial liquidity and provides a necessary depressurization outlet for excess capital. In short, markets and exchanges provide the heartbeat of an economy.

At their worst, they are vehicles for manic speculation. They are Petri dishes for fraud that potentiate corporate greed and allow those who are already incredibly wealthy to inflate that wealth to hilarious levels. They are cold and emotionless; only serving as a vacuum for capital. In the end, the ticker takes over and becomes the business itself.

I believe that there is one fund in particular that is single-handedly propping up the market through its manipulative options and short-selling strategies; ***Citadel LLC.*** Although I'm sure this doesn't come as a surprise to many of those who frequent this subreddit, I'll still include a **brief** synopsis below.

In 1990, a man named Kenneth Griffin founded Citadel LLC.

From 2007-2008, Citadel barred investors from withdrawing money from their 7:1 levered accounts

In 2011, Citadel recruited energy traders from Enron the day after it collapsed

In 2021, Citadel and Point72 Capital invested $2.75 billion in Melvin Capital after their infamous 53% value collapse

From 2014-2022, Citadel currently has 74 FINRA disclosures on file that detail a multitude of fraudulent trading activities.

**SUMMARY**

Below is a clip from Citadel Securities LLC's official FINRA BrokerCheck report showing the total number of regulatory filings against them.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bf3ltt3zx7ga1.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e5510b1a5ef8bfd435015e5a3ccfefb98b6bfdac

Above is an example of the claim by NASDAQ MRX against Citadel for options manipulation. Specifically, the allegations pertain to [Rule 13c 3-5](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/faq-15c-5-risk-management-controls-bd.htm) of the SEC's Securities Exchange Act. It is important to note that almost all brokers/hedge funds have a few flags on their FINRA reports due to untimely filings, erroneous orders, or the like. However, Citadel has an ***Abnormally large number*** of these ""errors"".

When confronted with these allegations, it is almost always easier to pay the $xxx,xxx fine rather than admit to any wrongdoing or go to court. To be exact, from 2010-present Citadel has paid over $60 million in fines alone from pre-trade manipulation claims by various markets. I will post the most significant injunction below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cy68k7l2y7ga1.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=08de8fa79944aa11032e98552ad83701efe114f6

What this injunction suggests, is that Citadel knowingly manipulated market orders from their clearing service. These manipulations can include marking short orders as long orders, backdating trade dates to make it appear as though profits or losses were made during a certain period when they were not, or misrepresenting the types of securities sold.

Cited as ""undetected coding errors""

If you are familiar with Bernie Madoff's infamous Ponzi operation, these reports bear a striking resemblance to the SEC's own findings in the year-long proceedings. However, I don't believe that they're operating in the exact same manner.

Citadel is a pooled investment vehicle, which means they pool investor funds to purchase assets, securities, and commodities. Their SEC EDGAR 13F-HR reports do not necessarily raise any specific red flags, but it does raise some interesting questions.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/whruo51x18ga1.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5ccb05b6891a8763568f013251b52f47abbb4686

It is not uncommon for hedge funds to use manipulative options strategies, but the exception with Citadel is the sheer size and scale at which they can operate. Typically these manipulation techniques involve ""spoofing"" or placing large numbers of bid or ask orders and then canceling those orders prior to fulfillment. This artificially inflates or deflates stock prices and can manipulate spreads or supply/demand curves.

Large high-frequency trading firms can also front-run trades or place trades of their own in front of large trades they see coming through in their own dark pools. Again, this is not inherently *illegal* per se, but it does exemplify the informational inequality between institutional and retail traders. What crosses the line from ""technically legal"" to ""illegal"" with regard to Citadel's operations is the blatant disregard for NBBO regulations that hold firms accountable for ensuring they have the shares to back their trades. ***In summary, Citadel most likely does not even own the large majority of the shares it is trading.*** These strategies have historically wreaked havoc in markets, and with the latest crash of the NYSE, it appears to be happening once again. At some point, exchanges simply can't keep up with the volume of trades coming through at once in a fraction of a second.

**So if this technique has been used for so long without issue, then why does it matter?**

Fundamentally speaking, the stock market operates on the assumption that issued shares by a company accurately reflect the laws of supply and demand. Whereas, a company that has solid fundamentals, growth, and revenue will be worth more than a company that is struggling to remain solvent. **Shareholder dilution** has been largely **ignored** over the past few years, and this is understandable as the number of dollars available to purchase shares has increased significantly. Just as the treasury can print a theoretically unlimited number of dollars, so too can companies print a theoretically unlimited number of shares.

We've become so used to share issuances, stock splits, and ""Fail to Deliver"" orders that we've completely lost sight of the inherent dangers of share dilution. Share dilution can be overlooked in markets that are flushed with capital, as the money must have more assets to chase. However, when markets begin to slow down, the supply of shares floating in the market becomes an exponentially compounding liability. We have companies with over 100% of their float being owned by institutions, and many have indirect ties to Citadel. For example, here is a recent SEC filing of Citadel Securities LLC.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ar99jwxby7ga1.png?width=1151&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=447451cf5f5e5fd9175a112fb9a06486dcc19f52

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, Citadel Advisors LLC is the original purchaser of the stock issuance followed by Kenneth Griffin's own purchase. This specific stock's float is already 101.6% held. This happens over and over again in Citadel's filings.

1st: Citadel subsidiaries purchase a large number of outstanding shares

2nd: Kenneth Griffin purchases a large percentage of the class himself

3rd: Kenneth Griffin offloads shares once the capital from Citadel subsidiaries has sufficiently spiked the price of the stock

It is a recurring cycle that may not necessarily be illegal but has incredibly devastating implications for the market. It also implies that Kenneth Griffin may be utilizing clients' capital through Citadel subsidiaries for personal gain.

**THE VIX AND THE NASDAQ**

I believe that the VIX is one of these complexes that has been heavily manipulated by HFT firms. I have written a post specifically regarding the VIX complex, so I won't go into detail in this post. However, since VIX-related assets like UVXY, VXX, and UVIX are often used as insurance against market declines,  believe they are well-positioned to experience a large spike in activity if these high-frequency trading strategies fail or create a ""flash crash"" scenario. 

Furthermore, the VIX is currently sitting at 18.33, near its 52-week low of 17.06. If the suppression measures in place fail, regardless of market direction or sentiment, it could easily spike. It should be noted, however, that leveraged assets like UVXY often decay quickly. 

The NASDAQ Exchange (NDAQ) is also in an impossible situation. In 2021 alone, there were over 1,000 new IPOs. The largest amount during a 1 year period in modern history. Many of these IPOs are at risk of being delisted due to exchange regulations. Recently, NDAQ has seen a rise in revenue from products and fees tied to listings and management expenses from this euphoric rise in IPO interest. However, I believe that as SPACs and ""zombie IPOs"" begin to fail, they will experience a sharp decline in associated revenue. As a matter of fact, they already are.

&amp;#x200B;

[NDAQ Working capital at an all-time low](https://preview.redd.it/qc0lsk1j18ga1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=79e335380204ea3e3b3c2b74c5d62ac1318e0090)

**CONCLUSION**

I understand that this is not an exhaustive report, and there are many other aspects of Citadel's operations that need to be investigated by professionals before a conclusion can be made regarding its illicit operations. All I know is that history has shown over and over again that institutions that post record-breaking quarters during periods of significant economic decline or volatility are *most likely* doing so by manipulative or outright fraudulent activities. In the coming months, the damage done by manipulative high-frequency options and stock trading will become pronounced. I view the best general-interest methods of profiting during an event such as this to be PUTS on exchanges such as NDAQ or ICE and shares/CALLS of Vix-related assets.

It is only a matter of time before the cracks in the glass shatter entirely, and the world sees that Kenneth Griffin's Citadel has been built on sand.

It is not uncommon for hedge funds to use manipulative options strategies, but the exception with Citadel is the sheer size and scale at which they can operate. Typically these manipulation techniques involve ""spoofing"" or placing large numbers of bid or ask orders and then canceling those orders prior to fulfillment. This artificially inflates or deflates stock prices and can manipulate spreads or supply/demand curves.

Large high-frequency trading firms can also front-run trades or place trades of their own in front of large trades they see coming through in their own dark pools. Again, this is not inherently *illegal* per se, but it does exemplify the informational inequality between institutional and retail traders. What crosses the line from ""technically legal"" to ""illegal"" with regard to Citadel's operations is the blatant disregard for NBBO regulations that hold firms accountable for ensuring they have the shares to back their trades. ***In summary, Citadel most likely does not even own the large majority of the shares it is trading.*** These strategies have historically wreaked havoc in markets, and with the latest crash of the NYSE, it appears to be happening once again. At some point, exchanges simply can't keep up with the volume of trades coming through at once in a fraction of a second.

**So if this technique has been used for so long without issue, then why does it matter?**

Fundamentally speaking, the stock market operates on the assumption that issued shares by a company accurately reflect the laws of supply and demand. Whereas, a company that has solid fundamentals, growth, and revenue will be worth more than a company that is struggling to remain solvent. **Shareholder dilution** has been largely **ignored** over the past few years, and this is understandable as the number of dollars available to purchase shares has increased significantly. Just as the treasury can print a theoretically unlimited number of dollars, so too can companies print a theoretically unlimited number of shares.

We've become so used to share issuances, stock splits, and ""Fail to Deliver"" orders that we've completely lost sight of the inherent dangers of share dilution. Share dilution can be overlooked in markets that are flushed with capital, as the money must have more assets to chase. However, when markets begin to slow down, the supply of shares floating in the market becomes an exponentially compounding liability. We have companies with over 100% of their float being owned by institutions, and many have indirect ties to Citadel. For example, here is a recent SEC filing of Citadel Securities LLC.

As you can see, Citadel Advisors LLC is the original purchaser of the stock issuance followed by Kenneth Griffin's own purchase. This specific stock's float is already 101.6% held. This happens over and over again in Citadel's filings.

1st: Citadel subsidiaries purchase a large number of outstanding shares

2nd: Kenneth Griffin purchases a large percentage of the class himself

3rd: Kenneth Griffin offloads shares once the capital from Citadel subsidiaries has sufficiently spiked the price of the stock

It is a recurring cycle that may not necessarily be illegal but has incredibly devastating implications for the market. It also implies that Kenneth Griffin may be utilizing clients' capital through Citadel subsidiaries for personal gain.

**CONCLUSION**

I understand that this is not an exhaustive report, and there are many other aspects of Citadel's operations that need to be investigated by professionals before a conclusion can be made regarding its illicit operations. All I know is that history has shown over and over again that institutions that post record-breaking quarters during periods of significant economic decline or volatility are *most likely* doing so by manipulative or outright fraudulent activities. In the coming months, the damage done by manipulative high-frequency options and stock trading will become pronounced.

It is only a matter of time before the cracks in the glass shatter entirely, and the world sees that Kenneth Griffin's Citadel has been built on sand.

**PREFACE**

Since the origination of the US stock exchange in 1792, countless investors have tried their hands at identifying profitable strategies for building their wealth. In the beginning, these strategies were relatively straightforward. First, find a business that you believe in. Next, take your own hard-earned money and extend a show of faith to the business that you believe will generate substantial returns. Then, after years of development and growth, reap the rewards of your faith through returns on your investment. 

I believe that, at their core, stock markets are fundamental to any economy. In its purest form, a stock market is a way for economies to establish healthy competition between corporations. It ensures financial liquidity and provides a necessary depressurization outlet for excess capital. In short, markets and exchanges provide the heartbeat of an economy. 

At their worst, they are vehicles for manic speculation. They are Petri dishes for fraud that potentiate corporate greed and allow those who are already incredibly wealthy to inflate that wealth to hilarious levels. They are cold and emotionless; only serving as a vacuum for capital. In the end, the ticker takes over and becomes the business itself.

I believe that there is one fund in particular that is single-handedly propping up the market through its manipulative options and short-selling strategies; ***Citadel LLC.*** Although I'm sure this doesn't come as a surprise to many of those who frequent this subreddit, I'll still include a **brief** synopsis below.

In 1990, a man named Kenneth Griffin founded Citadel LLC. 

From 2007-2008, Citadel barred investors from withdrawing money from their 7:1 levered accounts

In 2011, Citadel recruited energy traders from Enron the day after it collapsed

In 2021, Citadel and Point72 Capital invested $2.75 billion in Melvin Capital after their infamous 53% value collapse

From 2014-2022, Citadel currently has 74 FINRA disclosures on file that detail a multitude of fraudulent trading activities. 

**SUMMARY**

Below is a clip from Citadel Securities LLC's official FINRA BrokerCheck report showing the total number of regulatory filings against them.

https://preview.redd.it/2u3hazfg4sfa1.png?width=1558&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=df5aa3fe4991f86377969d6145cd5337a4ec52f4

Above is an example of the claim by NASDAQ MRX against Citadel for options manipulation. Specifically, the allegations pertain to [Rule 13c 3-5](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/faq-15c-5-risk-management-controls-bd.htm) of the SEC's Securities Exchange Act. It is important to note that almost all brokers/hedge funds have a few flags on their FINRA reports due to untimely filings, erroneous orders, or the like. However, Citadel has an ***Abnormally large number*** of these ""errors"". 

When confronted with these allegations, it is almost always easier to pay the $xxx,xxx fine rather than admit to any wrongdoing or go to court. To be exact, from 2010-present Citadel has paid over $60 million in fines alone from pre-trade manipulation claims by various markets. I will post the most significant injunction below.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/omy734821zfa1.png?width=1161&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=214b0fb0f3109dc2dae97c7e9c5e495964a87cad

What this injunction suggests, is that Citadel knowingly manipulated market orders from their clearing service. These manipulations can include marking short orders as long orders, backdating trade dates to make it appear as though profits or losses were made during a certain period when they were not, or misrepresenting the types of securities sold.

&amp;#x200B;

[80 million trades were misrepresented in SEC documentation](https://preview.redd.it/qb2647pb2zfa1.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bf7b0513b0c7b2d183554567dd8c6b1cc42e313d)

If you are familiar with Bernie Madoff's infamous Ponzi operation, these reports bear a striking resemblance to the SEC's own findings in the year-long proceedings. However, I don't believe that they're operating in the exact same manner. 

Citadel is a pooled investment vehicle, which means they pool investor funds to purchase assets, securities, and commodities. Their SEC EDGAR 13F-HR reports do not necessarily raise any specific red flags, but it does raise some interesting questions.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aat8rbyz6zfa1.png?width=1887&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b2020fd5cb505a99d736e93f55179b11bbee0c9f

It is not uncommon for hedge funds to use manipulative options strategies, but the exception with Citadel is the sheer size and scale at which they can operate. Typically these manipulation techniques involve ""spoofing"" or placing large numbers of bid or ask orders and then cancelling those orders prior to fulfillment. This artificially inflates or deflates stock prices and can manipulate spreads or supply/demand curves. 

Large high-frequency trading firms can also front-run trades, or place trades of their own in front of large trades they see coming through in their own dark pools. Again, this is not inherently *illegal* per say, but it does exemplify the informational inequality between intitutional and retail traders. What crosses the line from ""technically legal"" to ""illegal"" with regard to Citadel's operations is the blatant disregard for NBBO regulations that hold firms accountable for ensuring they have the shares to back their trades. ***In summary, Citadel most likely does not even own the large majority of the shares it is trading.*** These strategies have historically wrecked havoc in markets, and with the latest crash of the NYSE, it appears to be happening once again. At some point, exchanges simply can't keep up with the volume of trades coming through at once in a fraction of a second.

**So if this technique has been used for so long without issue, then why does it matter?**

Fundamentally speaking, the stock market operates on the assumption that issued shares by a company accurately reflect the laws of supply and demand. Whereas, a company that has solid fundamentals, growth, and revenue will be worth more than a company that is struggling to remain solvent. **Shareholder dilution** has been largely **ignored** over the past few years, and this is understandable as the number of dollars available to purchase shares has increased significantly. Just as the treasury can print a theoretically unlimited number of dollars, so too can companies print a theoretically unlimited number of shares.

446,wallstreetbets,"Shares melted up since early January after a late Christmas rally. The timing is convincing evidence that the god of markets has converted to Orthodox Christianity, celebrating Christmas on Jan 7 instead of Dec 24 or 25. People on WSB were nevertheless happy because our religion is 0dte in either direction really.

Meanwhile, APPL rose some 24.6% since its low the first trading day of the year and appears to prepare for an exponential run to rise another 1700% or so by June.

The reasons behind that massive market overpowered-nes may be confusing to some. Even after earnings day, the stock rallied like on speed. Therefore, I decided to put together a summary of the three most convincing theses for this killer move.

1) iPhone Sales &amp; Revenue
It is true that iPhone sales and revenue overall surprised to the downside on earnings day. However, the management pinky promised hypothetical sales that would have kicked ass if things had developed differently. As Yahoo Finance masterfully puts it, ‚ÄòApple‚Äôs report wasn‚Äôt as bad as it could have been.‚Äò This naturally justifies the Friday rally as well as the upcoming 1700% or so bull run until June.
[Source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-earnings-were-a-lot-better-than-they-look-203753307.html)

2) Food Prices
Food and tech prices negatively correlated throughout 2022. In the US, the food at home index rose 11.8 percent over the last 12 months (except for people who primarily have an eggs-based diet and, therefore, cannot afford internet and being on WSB anymore). The QQQ lost over 30% in the same period. People seeing old iPhone release videos by Steve Jobs and realizing that AAPL‚Äòs last innovation wasa few decades ago noted one crucial fact: AAPL was not a tech company for a long time and should not have been valued as a tech company in 2022. The interim consensus appears to be to value AAPL as a food company - justifying said 1700% rally until June.

What started the case was precisely that deposits on Anchor Protocol suddenly decreased sharply. $2 billion of UST was withdrawn from the Anchor Protocol by one player and promptly sold, causing the peg to plummet from $1 to about $0.9. Of course people tried to take advantage of this by buying UST at the cheaper price and exchanging it for $1 in LUNA. However, since there was a limit that only $100 million UST could be exchanged per day, these people soon ran into problems. This meant that the acquisition of UST in the market was not as large as it could have been and that the peg was therefore not restored.

We can restore the value by doing the same thing! If enough people buy, it can go just as fast! What do you think?

 How many evil American secrets does the ‚ÄúPfizer Executive Undercover Video‚Äù expose?

*Processing img ql3rb7s1s4ga1...*

This video attracted a lot of attention around the world and cast doubts on the way Pfizer in the United States should be, and had a huge impact. 

It is very likely that Pfizer's future will be directly or indirectly affected. 

The video was released by a British ""private journalists group"" and features a Pfizer executive named Jordan Walker. 

Jordan Walker is Pfizer's Director of Research and Development, responsible for strategic operations and mRNA scientific planning, according to public information.

*Processing img 2b23j8ibs4ga1...*

In other words, if the leaked video is true, he is the person responsible for Pfizer's ""development of mutated viruses"" and the person who systematically carried out research and development.

 Pictures online show Jordan Walker in absolute center. In the undercover video, Jordan Walker reveals two top secrets.

The first is that Pfizer is conducting research in the direction of ""controlling mutations"" of the new coronavirus. The advantage, in the words of Jordan Walker, is that ""if this variant starts to spread globally, Pfizer will be the first to provide a vaccine."" ""The constant mutation of the new coronavirus has made vaccine development against this variant a cash cow for Pfizer USA."" Simply put, Pfizer is making a variant of the novel coronavirus.

*Processing img j193vt1es4ga1...*

The second is Pfizer's new coronavirus ""extracorporeal injection"" test. In Jordan Walker's words, ""injecting different monkeys to simulate animal experiments to screen for more virulent infective variants and find more virulent variants.""

*Processing img brtdwqsiu4ga1...*

Third, the U.S. government's Drug Enforcement Administration dares not, or will not, to investigate Pfizer's conduct. The United States has a ""revolving door"" system, through which Drug Enforcement Administration agents are made future Pfizer jobs. And Pfizer professionals will also work for governments through the ‚Äúrevolving door‚Äù in the future. 

This ""undercover investigation video"" became a big topic around the world after its release. 

The best part of this clip is when Jordan Walker later realizes he's being filmed and immediately stands up and destroys the filming tablet. He recorded the scene with another camera.

*Processing img ksbini26u4ga1...*

I have to believe! 

What's even more bizarre is that the liberal US company Google deleted the video when it first went viral, and even temporarily blocked the video's publisher. 

What is even more bizarre is that the Western media, which pride themselves on freedom of the press and freedom of speech, have remained surprisingly unanimously silent in the face of this powerful global explosion of news.

*Processing img 2fh1ltw7u4ga1...*

US lawmakers, who usually like to track viruses, are silent in line with this amazing group!

Pervert!

And perverts, there must be demons.

Amidst a worldwide sensation, Pfizer finally had to open its mouth and deny the allegations with an ""explanation"" article on its website.

But this ""clarification"" is perhaps the strangest, since Pfizer does not deny the most central point.

For example, it does not deny the identity of Jordan Walker executives, nor the two virus experiments confirmed in the video, namely the creation of coronavirus variants.

Pfizer has even admitted to conducting ""extracorporeal injection"" trials for the new coronavirus.

Looking at Pfizer's ""explanation"" in detail, it denies only ""using the virus to monetize"" and ""creating and distributing mutant strains"", but the two core virus experiments , just a play on words to give them a nice, bright, just reason they approve.

But the strangest thing happened in China. 

The US and Western media were shockingly silent, afraid to report or refute the story of Pfizer's new virus, but China quickly jumped on the bandwagon, calling the video a rumor. affixed the label. 

Among them, the media first branded the British ""private journalist group"" that filmed this video as a ""fake site"", and borrowed the mouths of two prominent virus experts from Hong Kong and the mainland, saying, ""Pfizer is doing this kind of research. I can't do it,"" he threatened. 

It was like having an expert working for Pfizer. 

The so-called fake labeling of videographers is a vicious smear campaign intended to mislead the video into being unreliable.

In parallel, some traitors are also active, claiming that this video is a rumor, based on the fact that the US media has not reported it, and the caliber is very consistent. 

This logic is simple! 

However, China has more maturity in modifying known viruses through ‚Äúreverse genetics technology‚Äù and artificial directed mutation at the laboratory level, and developing new variants of the novel coronavirus in the laboratory itself. Some experts have pointed out the basic fact that is technically possible. 

So it's technically possible for Pfizer to create a new strain of the new coronavirus. 

Finally, despite the worldwide skepticism about this video, and despite the fact that people in the West are convinced that it is real, the Western media are voluntarily Why is the Chinese media, so-called pundits, so eager to speak up and ""dispel rumors"" for Pfizer, despite being silent and silent?

515,wallstreetbets,"Shiba is still the King/Queen of meme coins...STILL. Somehow after all this time it's managed to stay alive and offer hope to many. It does have a whopping supply of 549 trillion. Interestingly, the creator seems to never give up on coming up with ideas and solutions for the coin to continue growing. Either it's a very sophisticated and patient rug pull, or maybe, just maybe it's going to be something cool. At this point it's been around hanging on even dominating at times for so long I really believe in it's potential. I'm not claiming to know much about it or crypto in general, but what I do remember is that about a year ago after some few month build up, it had a historical run and reached an all time high in a matter of days. Elon musk helped this after being asked about it and he showed a picture of his shiba dog or something and then the price just sky rocketed even more. The point of this post isn't to argue if it'll last or not. The point is that crypto, especially this coin, seems to be social. It's clearly got some hype and build up right now and in the past couple months with the news of shibarium coming sometime in next month. It will inevitably have a small run but I'm hoping we can make it bigger. Very big. Before the haters come, stop hating and let's just make the price go up. Not yet, but we gotta wait until the news comes up that shibarium is official. Once that happens it'll take off and naturally people well flock like white on rice. To take it a step further tho...we can get a bunch of people to @ elon and ask how his shiba dog is doing or whatever and basically just get him to respond. Any response will more than likely propel the price even more sense he seems to enjoy this game. Call it wishful thinking. Either way I'm gonna personally make money because the chart is going to rally either way. BUT let's make this rally huge and all make some BIG fast. Before you say that can't happen go back and look at how crazy and fast the last rally happened about a year ago completely  because of talk, hype, and momentum with an added bit of elon. The news to come now for shiba is even better than it was last year plus the overall crypto market is begging to climb do to its continued acceptance. I'm hoping we all just patiently wait and then...strike! The point is it's gonna rally either way, and soon. Let's just all work together to really help propel that rocket! We legit can do it! I'm not saying it's gonna be a Gamestop situation, but, we can make something like this happen again very easily. And for the record in general I've always really liked and been hopeful for shiba. The last time it surged I messed up and didn't pill out while I was ahead. I'm not saying to stay invested in shiba. Just to make a really big wave and get out on top. We can make a lot of money!

When I read that Ryan Cohen invested in Nordstrom, I thought that it would spike and then fall, so I went short. Meh.

My next thought was that there is a large community on reddit that likes the stocks he invests in, and those stonk options experience high demand and huge gamma, eventually, and then they crash. So, naturally, I bought calls, particularly April $40 calls, which nearly immediately after I bought them, they went up by 20%. Meh.

The fascinating part, at least to a nerd like me, is that I let my faith in humanity and human nature override my rational thinking. I now trust that the apes will be strong, hold the line, hedgies will be fukk, and there will be many new HODLers moving from certain Ryan Cohen rug pull(s) that are about to go bankrupt, into Nordstrom which should experience an even harder gamma run.

To quote Taleb, ""my calls are antifragile, gamma rules, my style is impetuous, my defense is impregnable, and I'm just ferocious."" Not quite sure he actually said this sentence at a lecture, but that is how holding April Nordstrom calls feels (gamblers do not get the rush when they actually win or lose, but when they anticipate their gain or loss).....so LLLLFFFFGG motherfuckers, moon soon, lambo or ramen, and whatever the fuck they say to pump themselves up every day.

598,wallstreetbets,"We all love the moonshot pureplay company, and we all love to think we incentivize science with our investments. However, it is possibly best if innovation remains a side hustle for larger firms, closed government programs, and study projects for graduate students at universities.

Universities are good at science because they don't have to turn a profit ever. This is because most of their workers are students who pay them to learn and practice science and because they receive donations from governments and rich people who like science. One chemist said a significant portion of his time was spent applying for grants because they need the money to do the experiments. Much of what comes out of universities is pure science, meaning it has no foreseeable practical application but some of it is used in future experiments.

Government programs are the same because the taxpayers do what they want with their money. For instance, as awesome as the James Webb Telescope is, it is unlikely to make any discovery with a practical application, at least within our lifetimes. Programs run by the Department of Defense are looking for things with practical applications but they're not worried about turning a profit as long as the discovery gives them an advantage. For instance, at the moment the army is spending many millions on ""careless ammo"" research, making bullets lighter and cheaper by reducing the amount of brass metal in them. This has had modest results so far, and if this was a for-profit venture that would spell disaster.

As for existing large for-profit firms, they can afford to risk their money on modest ventures. For instance, a factory I use to work for told their programmers to redo the software on the machines to improve efficiency. Or how big automotive companies did most of the work on autonomous robot arms so they could automate much of the assembly lines. These companies can afford to keep paying their people even if they don't spend all their time actually on their factory floor, especially when they're doing small incremental discoveries. This is how most sciences worked before the industrial revolution, where skilled workers would simply do experiments in their free time to get a better product. Of course, in modern times it is possible to have ""ideas factories"" where all they do is make small incremental discoveries which they sell, starting with the Edison Electric Company. But in more recent days, a joint venture between Bill Gates and General Electric is making the NuScale nuclear reactor.

This is where the startups come in. Here we start with nothing, just a group of scientists with an idea. This idea is funded, and they work and work living off their investor's money until either they run out or they produce a marketable product. Most of these fail, but the few that succeed get rich. It is only possible for these ventures to get equity funding, not loans because equity shifts all the risk onto the investors. A good case in point is one former hedge fund manager once said that he called a private firm trying to invest, saying the CEO had a great profitable firm. The CEO said something to the effect of ""Yes it is a great firm, so why would I sell it to YOU?"" This shows how most innovative startups you and I have access to have a negative selection bias. The scientists are not independently wealthy people that can cover the bills if things go wrong, the scientists have nothing and need some chump to take the risk off their hands.

Why would anyone invest with something that has a lottery-like payoff? Well, there's gamblers around here, but that very fact is why securities with lottery-like payoffs tend to be systemically overvalued, causing inferior average returns. Of course, the real reason is because of many decades of low-interest rates. Since bonds have mediocre returns, people have to seek out risky investments in order to get good returns. It should be noted that the biotech industry has collapsed right alongside buttcoin, Chinese banks, and retail trading due to rising interest rates in the US. This is not because of systemic fraud in biotech, but because most of them are cash-burning microcaps. Also note that private and public equity has near-identical returns, except private equity doesn't get a continuously updated quote on their value so sometimes losses are hidden.

Of course, there are a lot of frauds with innovative startups, where the scientists are bogus and they just spewed out jargon so investors would give them money. But you can see that while there are low interest rates you could have an accidental Ponzi scheme, where somewhat promising results push valuations higher and higher over time and the lights are kept on by bringing on a new investor while never actually achieving profitability. Of course, the valuations of both the fools and the frauds go to near zero the instant Jerrome Powell announces a 2% potential increase in US bond yields.

To show how bad innovative startups are: They have the exact same payoffs, risks, and success rate as crowd-funded ventures.

But what if you want to invest in science still? Well, you can sort through firms that are profitable now but spend an above average amount of revenue on innovation. You could also target firms you think will profit the most from select discoveries in science. And of course, having an actual understanding of the science involved is what will actually make you win in these plays. As for the rest of us, you're probably better off making a donation to a university's STEM department.",Startups are Fundamentally Bad at Innovation.,1675477660

651,wallstreetbets,"Summary: ""Big Oil"" Shell has its eyes on Volta Charging, an electric vehicle charging company. Do the big players like Shell see some big changes coming, and are embracing the future? Should oil companies that dominate the car gasoline market have control over the EV market?

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, there is billions for funding support of EV adoption, and under Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, there is $900,000 available for the first round for EV charging infrastructure across 35 states. More and more people are buying electric vehicles, and more car manufacturers are building EVs, and with the federal government investing in EV charging station infrastructure, the EV market is going to grow and increase in stock value.

Out of all the EV charging companies, Big Oil Shell wants to own Volta. So Shell must think Volta has better value and worth it, compared with competitors. So I am not aware of any other moves like this from other oil companies, so I will just discuss Shell and Volta. So Volta is an EV charging company, but very unique. The chargers have a display on them, which allows Volta to sell advertising space which pays for the free charging that drivers get to enjoy. These chargers can be placed in front of retail stores, and the ads can be relevant to the surrounding shopping stores, and encourage drivers parking their car and all people walking around, to go spend their money at the stores. No other EV charging company does this. Making money off of ads is how Google built their empire. Peak value for Volta was $15 before the market went down, so investors liked Volta before the market dropped all stocks. As of now, the stock already almost tripled after hitting the bottom in December.

The EV market is supposed to free us from oil companies, and now oil companies don't want to lose, so they are looking to own high quality EV related companies with value and potential like Volta. Other EV related companies could also be susceptible to other oil companies like Exxon, BP , etc that may want to control the EV market also. The big players are looking long term, looking for value, looking for power and control, and know how to play the game.

If Big Oil Shell wants Volta, then should I or we want Volta? Should we encourage Volta to stop any deal with oil companies like Big Oil Shell? Save Volta ? What can we do? Figure out how to own the EV market through stock ownership?",Oil and water don't mix. Therefore should Big Oil and EV go together?,1675471377

685,wallstreetbets," Dean Kehler, $GXII co-CEO and the NioCorp Team have been spotted throughout DC this past week.

For those unaware, the SEC approved earlier this week the votes from shareholders in each companies, to approve the merger announced last quarter.

Merger approval would lead to a deal that can be compared to that $MP achieved \~10 years ago, prior to growing to a market cap of $6B , that's $6 Billions, at the bottom of the 2022 market correction!!!

To quickly understand what NioCorp is seeking to achieve by merging with $GXII, check this quick video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOanFIMpkk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFOanFIMpkk)

The US today depends almost 100% on China or other competing nation to source their rare earth, used every day to reinforce the steel in our bridges or skyscappers, or the aluminum in our airplanes or our electric vehicles (EVs).

The $GXII-Niocorp project to open a mine in Nebraska would greatly reduce this dependency on foreign competitors: The Elk Creek mine in NE has been described by the US Geologic Surveys (USGS), as the 2nd largest REE resource in the US!!! See [here](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorps-elk-creek-project-confirmed-as-the-second-largest-indicated-or-better-rare-earth-resource-in-the-u-s/). All permits have already been approved . And, unlike $MP, the ore processing is expected to take place at the mine in NE.

721,wallstreetbets,"There is one thing that is very clear about this market right now. It has not fully accepted the totality of events and data that has been presented to it. Lets review just how unbullievable this market was this week. 

We saw Meta post a 20% miss on earnings (which is huge!) and they rallied 30% intraday to put in one of their biggest days in 10 years‚Ä¶ 

We saw JPOW himself stand up there and tell the market to their faces there will be a COUPLE more rate hikes, unemployment is far too low and the labor market is far too strong, AND that he will NOT be pausing anytime soon‚Ä¶ The market proceeded to rally almost $10 off that and have one of its biggest green opens in a while. 

We watched three of the biggest companies out there and holdings in SPY all post misses on earnings the SAME night‚Ä¶ and the next day markets RALLY back to green‚Ä¶ And Apple who has posted one of its worst quarters in a VERY long time closes a green day after a huge earnings miss‚Ä¶ 

We also watched markets received its 10th upside surprise on nonfarm payroll AND print its lowest unemployment rates in a year and markets decided to rally $6 at the market open off that news‚Ä¶ 

We have also watched now the second ay in the row where SPY/ VIX move together instead of against eachother‚Ä¶ At open today despite a huge -1.2% red open on SPY we actually had seen a RED VIX. And today we are closing out a red VIX and a red SPY. 

This is probably the most I have ever seen markets detached from reality and failing to properly digest information. 

We have some interesting things happening next week too. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4mn0x1tto1ga1.png?width=947&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=30885b2d8db9327363bf5b8a772654314b483ff7

JPOW himself will be speaking on Tuesday. This is starting to give off some Jackson hole vibes. The market clearly did not hear anything that JPOW said on Wednesday and I would be very surprised to see him not attempt to make the market listen more and to re-iterate the bearishness of the fed. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ck8r3w8uo1ga1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e4df385ec29925d7983eec169744cfbf971f6213

The Fear and greed index at one point today hit 80. We are at levels of extreme greed we have not seen since November of 2021 (yes the ATH). 

Next week is also pre-CPI week. There is a lot riding on CPI and we could absolutely see our first true rebound in February. Next week will be very interesting to watch with JPOW Tuesday and CPI consensus hopefully being released EOW. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1kxvemmuo1ga1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3494a62d51f22537bf55cd8f79ab007bf84fae11

The question everyone wants the answer to is‚Ä¶ Are we bullish or Are we bearish? Lets talk about it‚Ä¶ 

As you can see here we are in a very clear black bull channel that we have officially been trading in since December 28th (yes this now a 5 week long bull channel). 

We have possibly seen a peak here and now because of the last two days of price action has formed a very nice breakout triangle within this bull channel. What that means is IF we were to retake that blue resistance line then there is a high probability (Assuming we held the black bull support) that we will push higher from here. However, there is a high probability if we lose this bull channels support that we are in for quite the sell off. 

There is a very large untouched area from 406.5 to 410.9 that I have my eye on. We could come as low as 407.3 Monday and still be in the bull channel. However, we can rise as high as 414.9 and still be in the breakout triangles resistance. 

Those should be our key pivot areas. My current bias is that markets have not properly digested the reality of earnings, recession, and everything JPOW said. I forsee a bigger sell off. However, if we come down to 405.3 to 406.5 support area and were to hold that (much like when we retested 390 support area) then I would be looking for a longer play here. 

If markets can survive Tuesday without a major sell off I do think there is a play for a larger run up into CPI on the 14th. 

One thing I did highlight here is the January 30th support bounce off the daily 8ema. If spy was to open green Monday or even slight red but maintain and close over todays closing price we could see a double bottom support bounce form which would almost certainly lead to further upside. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vucg3w9vo1ga1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7319dd44bd5547f767398d20f0a60927cd425040

Now taking a look at the weekly chart here I mentioned that 408.8 is a major pivot area. I called out this red channel of 375.6 to 408.8 back in December 2022 and said that the majority of our trading is likely to happen between that with 427.5 and 256.9 being our extremes. However, if this momentum was to continue up we actually could attempt baring no major sell offs to establish a higher channel. The next major upside range would be 427.5 to 455. Now I am not saying we reach there its just something to keep in the back of our minds. 

The higher we are over 408.8 and closer we are to 427.5 the more I like 30-60dte puts. 

That 5 week long channel I mentioned earlier is actually a 6 week long channel when you look at the weekly here. 

Key weekly channel support is 406.2 (remember how important that level is?) and key weekly channel resistance is 425. Those are the two biggest areas to watch. 

Key SPY Weekly Support- 408.9 -&gt; 398.8 -&gt; 390.1

Key SPY Weekly Resistance- 417.4 -&gt; 427.5

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uabpncpvo1ga1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2f8099a3bb7efe6a8d262c23552484d5fd7f1ebd

Taking a look here at futures one of the biggest reasons I suspect us to have a retracement Monday is because of that black channel. As you can see Futes is in a blue bull channel much like we saw on SPY daily. However, futures is in a very clear black ‚Äúextreme‚Äù bull channel that started back on January 26th. 

In order to hold that support we have to open over 4175 (which is about 0.72% from futures current 4145 level). If they do not open over that level then that will lead to a further retracement. However, as I mentioned on SPY January 30th we saw a bigger retracement like this that double bottomed and then led to a even further bounce up. 

One thing to watch here is that while we clearly rejected that 4193 resistance today, we are holding 4145. There is absolutely a case that futures makes a 4145 double bottom and pushes higher Monday. 

However this is where we have to weigh TA strength. Is there a stronger case for 4145 double bottom and pop or is there a stronger case that this was the 2 week extreme bull channel support break and we end up with the stronger retrace to gather support. In essence I would support the retrace when we add in spy and the outside news/ economical factors.

Taking a look at futures here on the weekly the bull channel is actually almost 7 weeks long‚Ä¶ That means for the last 7 weeks we have done nothing but rise. 

We did confirm support at 4075 and confirm support at 4095 which is very bullish for next week. However, we failed to touch 4220 resistance and we are rejecting and closing at 4145 resistance which as you see has been a major level. 

The black bull channels support is at 4060 and resistance is at 4260. Those are our two major levels to watch. 

Key Futures Weekly Support- 4145 -&gt; 4095 -&gt; 4020

Key Futures Weekly Resistance- 4220 -&gt; 4280

The most incredible thing has got to be tesla.. Since its low on January 6th to todays HOD we have seen Tesla recover an impressive 96%!

Tesla has now closed 4 green days in a row and incredibly.. 10 out of the last 11 trading days on Tesla have been green days‚Ä¶ 

The question is have we finally seen a top on Tesla or not?

The case for this inverted hammer candle to be the top is very convincing. However we have to recognize that support bounce off the daily 100ema also at 183.7. But we equally have to recognize the hard rejection off 197 two days in a row which is a major pivot point and resistance on Tesla. 

That blue bull channel support remains at 187.6 for Monday.

Taking a look at Tesla weekly here you can see that there is the equally strong blue bull channel. The biggest thing to recognize this week is the weekly 8ema support bounce and closure over the weekly 200ema. However, as I have mentioned before and as you can see back in October that the 200ema is highly unlikely to break the first run through. We actually are seeing a pretty hard rejection off that 190 resistance that was established back in December. 

One of the biggest levels I wanted to watch this week and called out was $200 on tesla and 195.2. 195.2 is the weekly resistance and is a major pivot point. Failure to close over that and have an incredible 4 green weeks in a row we should be looking for a small pullback here on tesla finally. 

Key Tesla Weekly Support- 177.8 -&gt; 163.8 -&gt; 149.9

Key Tesla Weekly Resistance- 190.6 -&gt; 195.6 -&gt; 206.2 -&gt; 228.3

The last piece of this puzzle is the VIX‚Ä¶ We have been seeing finally a ton of movement on the VIX. We have been getting these extremely large movements up on the VIX the last two days now. 

Something intriguing is that the VIX despite closing red today closed back over that key 18.3 area. There is a very real case that yesterdays 17.06 bounce could have been the relative low and that we could look for VIX to push back to 20. 

With the VIX this low and the FG index at extreme greed levels and SPY pushing some of its more upper limits that we have seen in many months‚Ä¶ realistically we should be looking for a local bottom on VIX and top on SPY. 

Despite what price action wants us to believe there really is not enough good news happening in the market and world right now to warrant the VIX to continue to make new lows and for SPY to continue to make new highs.

Unfortunately I did put in a red week despite closing today out nice and green. 

When I reflect on my weekly trading I always ask myself despite P/L did I trade well? The answer is yes I did. I end this week red mostly because of the 0dte swing I did post FOMC expecting a red open. That play right there put me in red for the week. Yes I did close a longer 22dte put on tesla put at -50% but even with that I should and would have closed the week red. 

Looking at my actual level to level trades I had high success and traded very well. I actually maintained a 100% win rate on Monday and Tuesday with my level to level trades. 

The biggest thing that I am happy with this week is that I followed my rules. I didn‚Äôt chase trends and I didn‚Äôt let the market trap me into removing stop losses or taking risky plays.

735,wallstreetbets,"Late last night I attempted a feeble regarded attempt do perform DD on SQQQ and propose my case for why it would go up today ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10sb80h/sqqq\_analysis\_potential\_turnaround\_on\_222023/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10sb80h/sqqq_analysis_potential_turnaround_on_222023/)). I regardedly tried doing charting analysis on SQQQ which was quickly pointed out as highly MENSA level regardness.  I will now focus on QQQ more.

My strategy was based around the triple whammy earnings report from AMZN, GOOG and AAPL and the crazy moon markets had this week on not so moon worthy FOMC meeting minutes. Perhaps if we didn't have that hot jobs today report this wouldn't of materialized.  Futures crashed hard pre market and I was concerned that my ship may of already sailed. However I figured we would get a bounce early and then a selloff around noon. 

My plan for the day was 34 SQQQ Weekly (2/10 exp) and to short the hell out of COIN because a death cross appeared on it AH. I anticipated we would just bleed red and trend down all day but we certainly did have a little bounce before the planets aligned and I was on the road to realized gains.

I kept averaging into my plays and I was down about $1.5k on COIN and SQQQ at one point. Started to get the sick to my stomach feeling thinking I would give back the $3200 i made yesterday.  And honestly I was too premature shorting COIN otherwise I would of made more off it. Good learning lessons though.

I also made a HUGE mistake selling my SQQQ calls, i was selling one at a time with a $.05 trail stop and  things were going great, however around 50 calls remaining I accidentally unloaded all remaining calls  at once. I kind of kicked myself for it but for the week I'm over 7k and my portfolio performance is about 20% YTD.

I'm not wealthy by any means but fortunately I didnt completely blow up my account last year so I still have buying power and enough for day trading.

Lastly I am not a bull and not a bear. I commend all of you for your gains whether they come from shorts or longs. I wouldn't have been able to do this without the WSB community and for that I am very grateful for all of your contributions to this sub.  

That being said, QQQ closed out with a hammer doji which i think indicates we will see more bleeding out next week. I'll be here ready to capitalize, but also look for some potential plays. I am thinking we might see sector rotation out of tech which could further amplify a tech meltdown.

TLDR: Markets illogically mooned, AMZN/GOOG/AAPL earnings miss = buy SQQQ calls, profit 

Have a great weekend regards!!!

753,wallstreetbets,"Going into next week as we (everybody but me, actually) blew the top off this mother fucker to start 2023 and wrecked my long-dated puts, things have been happening in the underbelly of Mr. Market that are pretty concerning. Seems like the latter half of today was proof of that, but I digress:

1. DXY (Dollar) has seemingly found it's footing, up \~1.2% today and likely closing \~$103 sans a selloff while I write this.  This will further fuck earnings.
2. VIX ditto as above - seemed to have bottomed \~$17.30 this week, but has snuck up over the past two days and will likely climb as earnings take a further shit next week (with companies that will not be announcing buybacks to provide a cushion).
3. Natural Gas is riding a 25 MONTH low, beginning to climb today. Might have a bit more to fall but the risk is to the upside here by a mile. This trend has likely put downwards pressure on inflation readings to a lesser degree than oil, however it's still a thorn in consumers and manufacturers sides and increases here will cause pain.
4. Brent Crude seems to be at an inflection point. It's still up \~42% over the last three years, and 20% over the last five years. However, it's down 8% over the last year. I'm not an oil man and don't know what the fuck is going to happen here, however many analysts are still calling for oil to retouch $100/barrel. If that does occur, this will restart the inflation engine.
5. Clear back in June '22 the 10y/2y spread inverted. It's stayed inverted ever since, dropping to almost -.7 as of today. That is essentially Mr. Yield calling 911 on Mr. Market for driving as drunk as he's seen him in 40 years (that's the last time we were inverted this hard).

The FED decided in the last meeting, as I've said in comments elsewhere, that we probably won't see new lows this year sans a major catalyst. Why Powell was so dovish is something I'll never understand, but his job is based on politics and not performance (well, it's certainly performative but not based on results). Irrespective, there was and continues to be no reason for stretching a stock like Amazon to 30% gains in a month, or SPY +\~8% in the same period.

The shorts want to take it to Zero, and watch it file bankruptcy.  But we can change that.  If the stock can squeeze higher (call it over $25), the company can do an equity raise, 25% dilution, raise $1bln, and fund itself through the downturn.  Once the risk of bankruptcy is gone, all the shorts will have to fold their cards, thereby more short squeeze.

In a Bloomberg interview on Thursday, the Ark Invest CEO said ARKK gives investors more exposure to disruptive innovation stocks than the tech-heavy benchmark index.¬†

""As we were getting hit so badly, what we also saw is investors taking tax losses in some of Nasdaq and other strategies and moving into our strategy, which was hit so hard, because they did believe that we were going to rebound faster.""¬†

""We are the new Nasdaq,"" Wood said, as a selling point to investors of her fund. ""Look through \[the Nasdaq\] now, you will not find the kind of disruptive innovation, it certainly doesn't dominate those indexes,"" she added.¬†

 Wood's exchange-traded fund delivered a 28% gain for January following two years of low performance - it dropped 69% in 2022 and 21% in 2021.

ARKK has rebounded as tech stocks like Tesla, Spotify and Roku, which make up a large chunk of its portfolio, made a strong comeback at the start of 2023. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq rose just 10.62% last month.¬†

Compared to ARKK, the Nasdaq 100's top holdings include Amazon, Microsoft and Apple.¬†

The gain in Wood's fund was bolstered by investor optimism that cooling US inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve to ease up on its aggressive campaign of interest-rate increases, which have been adding pressure on corporate finances.

861,wallstreetbets,"# Macro and micro economics.

* For those that trade options without understanding both, **trading is futile**. You will lose money if you don't understand how the overall economy works on top of how individual business work. Macro and micro are the bedrock for how the overall economy works as well as options themselves.
* ***Macro helps you understand*** why fed rates are important to inflation, how supply of money is removed, how currency is valued and so forth. Macro impacts prices on the overall market more than micro does. ***Micro helps you understand*** how options are priced with supply and demand on top of earnings forecast, important ratios and supply and demand.

# Logic only goes so far when it comes to trading options. 

* The markets are only as rational as humans can be and more often than not, emotion is factored into prices which math (statistics specifically) cannot account for. *That means that if you can understand how demand manifests from an instinctual POV*\--kind of like how and why clothing trends manifest--you can sniff out what demand likely looks like for individual companies and how this can effect their bottom line.

*I'll give you a personal example:* ***Facebook's earnings for October 2022.***

* Meta's work with oculus completely disregards how and why people use social media to begin with. Unless your off work and value dawning on a headset, I don't anticipate people at working dawning a headset on their lunch break to catch up with friends and family. This was my theory starting March and shortly before earnings in October 2022, media outlets were reporting on the pitfall of users on the platform which was enough confirmation needed to go balls deep on puts.

Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alibaba (BABA).

Alibaba currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.04, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 12 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.04 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.

1007,wallstreetbets,"Amazon just reported their first unprofitable year since 2014, with a loss of $2.7 billion, even though holiday sales increased by 9%. They were hit hard by the 20% stake they took in the electric automaker Rivian whose value plummeted last year. Amazon was investing in Rivian hoping to replicate Tesla's success but Rivian made some missteps and its stock price dropped 82%.

[Image cred: u\/finance\_guy\_92](https://preview.redd.it/ak0oqpnpszfa1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=871a242bf172103a8ab7bdfcef621c8b671e05c9)

Now, Amazon is facing the reality of the post-pandemic world, with people returning to physical stores and getting hesitant to spend due to inflation. They're cutting costs by reducing the size of their warehouse expansion plans and cutting 18,000 jobs, about 5% of their workforce. Growth is also slowing down in their biggest money-maker, AWS cloud computing, as companies are trying to cut their budgets.  They're also facing a unionization fight and recent citations for safety violations from federal inspectors.

However, Amazon is still making moves by closing the $4 billion deal to buy One Medical, a chain of primary-care clinics, and launching a $5 prescription medication subscription service.

Here's a conservative investment idea in face of the weak guidance: Buy 1 $107.50c, Sell 1 $117.50c, Sell 1 $93p, all expiring 9/15/23

This trade can make up to **11%** (**19%** **annualized**) but also provide some insurance against negative price movement. Only start to lose any capital invested if AMZN falls below $92.50 at maturity (a -13% drop from current prices). 

As a variable defined outcome trade, if AMZN rallies earlier, you most likely will be able to exit the contracts early at higher annualized return. 

Got lucky and took gains prior to the earnings release with a similar defined outcome strategy.

1083,wallstreetbets,"As the Fed-led ""super Central banking week"" comes to a close with non-farm data, will the U.S. labor market continue to show signs of cooling as the Fed hopes?

Today, the closely watched non-farm report for January will be released. Economists generally expect job creation to fall gradually, wage pressures to continue to slow and the unemployment rate to edge up.

Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased by 190,000 in January after 223,000 in December.

The unemployment rate is expected to rise slightly to 3.6% from 3.5% last month, while the labor force participation rate is expected to be unchanged at 62.3%.

Average hourly earnings are expected to rise 0.3% month-on-month, while average hourly earnings are expected to fall to 4.3% year-over-year from 4.6% in December.

""I still think there are ways to get inflation down to 2 per cent without a really significant economic downturn or a significant rise in unemployment,"" said Mr Powell, the Fed chairman. While the Fed is nearing a pause in its policy tightening campaign, how long rates stay high depends largely on how long it takes for the labor market to improve and wage growth to slow.

The payrolls report could make it difficult for the Fed to forecast inflation. Wage inflation is important for understanding the near-term core PCE, which will help markets determine when the Fed will pause and the risk of an inflation rebound.

Nonfarm outlook reports from 24 major investment banks showed a further decline in nonfarm payrolls growth in January, but expectations varied widely among banks, with estimates for nonfarm job gains ranging from 130,000 to 305,000.

The labor market is gradually cooling and new jobs may fall back to 185,000

Economic uncertainty in the US continues, due in part to the weather, previously reported ADP payrolls unexpectedly cold, private sector payrolls fell sharply, the short-term employment outlook is less optimistic, challenger companies in January job cuts surged 440% year on year.

Wage inflationary pressures are likely to persist

Analysts expect average hourly earnings to rise 0.3 per cent month-on-month, unchanged from December's increase, but expect year-on-year growth to slow to 4.3 per cent.

Using yesterday's ADP data as a guide, wage growth rose 7.3 per cent year on year for the second month in a row, with most industries seeing little change in wage growth, media analysis said. But wage growth for job-hoppers is accelerating to 15.4 per cent in January.

Unit Labour costs rose 1.1 per cent in the fourth quarter, below expectations of 1.5 per cent and the slowest pace in nearly two years, which, if sustained, would help keep headline inflation down.

The outlook for wage inflation is important for understanding the near-term core PCE, helping markets anticipate when the Fed will pause and the risk of a rebound in inflation.

The close relationship between wages and non-core services inflation was highlighted at the February 1 FOMC meeting, so we believe any slowing in wage growth could weaken the hawkish stance of the Fed and do not expect a stronger-than-expected acceleration in wage growth in January to affect the Fed's decision.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/axa58u26kzfa1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8361136e63b2b1a18345b8284b3dd80872748b00

And how will U.S. stocks perform today?

Cooling the US Labour market is widely seen as the only way for the Fed to slow core inflation to 2 per cent.

As in the past, Powell stressed that he does not expect a rate cut this year, and you, as investors, are right to believe in the tide, but let me make it clear to you that many people do not believe him.

History show any mean of payment eventualy been replaced by another one. But at the same time it is not possible to predict what mean of payment will be more used per location.

\-Top 5-10 Limited supply commodities : Gold, silver, copper, zinc, aluminium...  
\-Top 5-10 Crypto currencies

Yet we know for sure that Fiat currency consistantly loose value over long term because their supply is constantly increased (also called inflation).

In other hands we also can't lean totaly on other value such as gold or Crypto because they're very volatile against fiat wich is still the main world mean of payment.

Such a mix it shall outperform fiat currencies because a part of it have limited supply asset, and still have a minimized volatility because it also contain fiat.

Here's what you can learn from the lead investor in Discord, Riot Games, and Snapchat:

Why is He Impressive?

\- Mitch is a general partner at Benchmark, a venture capital firm. They have invested in companies like Instagram, Dropbox, and Twitter.

\- He helped launch Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Spider-man PS4.

\- Mitch is the lead investor in Riot Games, Discord, and Snapchat.

What Can You Learn From Him?

1/ How to accept, learn from and deal with constant failure.

Mitch has helped develop and publish hundreds of games, some of which are smash hits, others turned out to be zeros.

He could have become pessimistic about the industry and investing.

Instead, Mitch accepted that constant failure is part of the job of a game developer and investor.

2/ Trust your instincts.

When Mitch was 24, all he did was talk about and play video games.

He loved everything about them.

But he chose the safe path, finishing law school and working at a law firm for a few years.

During that time, the gaming business in the US took off.

3/ Learn everything you can about your craft and go deep on the things you're interested in.

Mitch became a part owner of the Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) because he's spent ten years learning about football analytics.

In 2016, a friend reached out, asking him to help the new GM of LAFC with football analytics.

That led him to become part of the ownership team of the club a few months later.

This opportunity came because he went deep into learning about things that interest him.

1186,wallstreetbets,"The athleisure pioneer has rapidly taken market share over the years.

Over the past five years, shares of Lululemon (LULU 2.23%) have soared 287% (as of the afternoon of Jan. 10), which quintupled what the broader S&amp;P 500 returned. That's some incredible outperformance. And it's something that all investors are certainly trying to achieve with their own individual portfolios. 

Digging a bit deeper, it's clear there's one important reason for Lululemon's remarkable success. Let's take a closer look at what shareholders must know about this leading apparel stock.   


&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img vrp1grbazxfa1...*

Taking a bigger piece of the pie 

The global sportswear market, according to data provided by Statista, is valued at $380 billion today. And it is forecast to be worth $455 billion in 2027. This translates to an annualized gain of just 3.7% for the overall industry. That's still a healthy advancement, but it isn't jaw-dropping growth. 

Lululemon, on the other hand, has boosted its top line at a compound annual rate of 21.7% between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2021. And over the next five years, management expects annual revenue to jump to $12.5 billion. The company has some major growth pillars it can rely on, like continuing to focus on men's apparel, international expansion, and its digital channel. 

Right now, it's estimated that Lululemon commands only 2% of the global sportswear market (based on trailing-12-month revenue of $7.5 billion). If the leadership team, led by CEO Calvin McDonald, can achieve its five-year target, Lululemon's market share in 2027 will have climbed to just under 3%, or roughly a 40% increase. 

Undoubtedly, Lululemon's biggest rival is none other than Nike. The undisputed industry leader generated $49.1 billion in trailing-12-month sales, so its market share of 13% is certainly higher than Lululemon's today. However, Wall Street consensus analyst forecasts call for Nike's revenue to increase at a compound annual rate of just 8.1% over the next five fiscal years. While this will result in market share gains, it will pale in comparison to what Lululemon will be able to do. 

It's one thing to invest in companies that operate in industries exhibiting growth. It's even better to identify businesses that are increasing their sales at an even faster clip than the industry. This is what gaining market share is all about. In other words, it's taking a bigger piece of the pie. 

Investors can easily apply this analytical lens to other stocks they are looking at. Obviously, the first thing to make note of is how fast sales have increased for the specific company you're interested in. Then make a list of publicly traded competitors with financial statements that are easily attainable. This will allow you to compare sales data between major businesses in the industry. 

Finding estimates of the size of the total industry shouldn't be too difficult. Sometimes, these individual companies will mention the value of the market they operate in their SEC filings. If not, sources like Statista, or a simple Google search, can provide the necessary info. 

It's worth pointing out that investors should look at industry size estimates from multiple sources, where available, to ensure there aren't any huge discrepancies with the data. It's also critical to define the target industry as closely as possible. For example, in Lululemon's case, we are only focused on the activewear market, not the general apparel market, which is valued at more than $1.5 trillion globally. Clearly, this would seriously alter our market share calculations.",1 Key Reason Lululemon Is an Unstoppable Stock,1675416339

.

The ECB raised all three of its main interest rates by 50 basis points, with the main refinancing rate at its highest level since November 2008. Given underlying inflationary pressures, interest rates still need to rise steadily and sharply, with a further 50 basis point increase planned for March. The asset purchase program will be reduced by ‚Ç¨15bn per month between March and the end of June, and will vary over time after the second quarter. Will keep interest rates at a level restrictive enough to ensure that inflation returns to its 2% medium-term target in time. According to sources: ECB policymakers are expected to raise interest rates by 25 or 50 basis points in May, with at least two more hikes expected.

I have always made good money. I only did my last deployment because I got orders. Now I am fuked for life a broken back and brain damage. I am worthless to any employer. My house was damaged by hurricanes and replaced a roof that the insurance would only repair but forced me to replace. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. It was five years ago, and it is still snowballing. I have three kids, so their needs come first. It always covers their needs, and the rest pays them back. My injuries are getting worse baseball size lumps on the back of my knees and forget what I am doing‚Äîspending days trying to recover from reinjuries over and over. The latest and greatest treatments the VA doesn't cover. One surgery for the head and neck will cost me 40k. Another 20k for a cure to reduce the medications I am forced to take, It never ends, I have a half-million-dollar house with three hundred thousand in equity but can't get to it because the hurricane destroyed my credit. I watched millions get disaster assistance from upper-middle-class families and I now know why it's because you have to have good credit. The funny part is they could use the money they had access to that I didn't. While my family slept in the car, they got to go to hotels. You would think I would be qualified because I was poor, and I am poor because I was wounded in wartime. Nope, it means nothing America lost that loving feeling once we got wheeled out of the hospital. Dogs get better treatment. They at least don't let them suffer needlessly. I will end up losing my house before I can sell it and my family, and I will be without a home. Just like so many others, I know I will be told it was my choice you volunteer and it's true.

1224,wallstreetbets,"So, we have Amazon and Tesla, two companies that are about as different as oil and water. On one hand, you have Amazon, the king of online shopping, who's been around longer than many of us have had an email address. And on the other hand, you have Tesla, the new kid on the block, who's been making waves in the automotive industry with their electric cars and space rockets.

Now, let's take a look at the numbers. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Amazon's revenue went up 9%, which is pretty good, but Tesla's revenue went up 37%, which is like the equivalent of getting a participation trophy and a first place trophy at the same time. And while Amazon's operating income went down 22% YoY, Tesla's operating income went up 49% YoY, which is like passing a math test with flying colors while your best friend is stuck doing extra homework.

For the full year of 2022, Tesla's operating income was a whopping $13.7 billion, up 109% from the previous year, while Amazon's operating income was $12.2 billion, down 50% from the previous year. This is like running a marathon and realizing you're the winner while everyone else is still lacing up their shoes.

And finally, we have the market capitalization. Amazon has a market cap of $1,100 billion, which is impressive, but Tesla's market cap is $580 billion, which is like having a small boat instead of a yacht, but with the numbers above, Tesla should be the yacht while Amaozn is the boat

So, there you have it folks, Tesla is the clear winner in this stock battle, but just remember, investing in the stock market is like playing a game of chance, so always play responsibly!

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words.

What is the purpuse of the wash sale loss rule ? If you just end up adding the wash sale loss to your next repurchase (as an increased cost basis) at the end of final transaction after lets say 100 transactions from buying and selling at loss and then repurchasing until say the stock approaches bankrupcy and you sell everything for 1$ (lost 99.9%), wouldn't the cost basis of your last repurchase include the washsale that was ""denied"" so that your deductable capital loss in tax is still the same as if you did 2 transactions without repurchase: you bought 100 shares of A at 5$ and sold at a loss at 4.5$, rebought at 3$ sold at loss... until you finally sold everything for 1$ vs you bought at 5$ for 100 shares (500$) and sold 100 shares for a total price of 1$ Both cases you lost everything but one evokes the washsale rule but would the net change be different when filing your capital losses ?

1352,wallstreetbets,"Been seeing their shills and baggies write DD which I can‚Äôt be bothered to read because it‚Äôs quite frankly all overthinking and copium of people who don‚Äôt know how crypto works. 


Here is how crypto mining works for dummies: 

Now your in a small limited Minecraft world with only a set number of diamond blocks to mine. You go off and mine easy to find diamonds and it‚Äôs worth a lot. So others see you making money and they join your mining party. So right off the bat you now have to share those diamonds that are in the mines with everyone making your profits less since you have to split the diamonds. Not only that but all the easy surface level diamonds in caves have been mined and now you have to jump around in lava to mine more diamonds making it more expensive and riskier to mine those diamonds but the prices are rocketing so you take the risks and you keep mining. However, the world is small and limited so you eventually run out of diamonds to mine and go homeless once u finish selling all your diamonds. 

So the two issues encountered in crypto mining:

1. Mining crypto (bitco specifically) becomes harder, takes longer time and costs more money to do

2. If the price drops it can become more expensive than mining costs and you can end up with a loss on all ur bags

3. Eventually bitco runs out and there is nothing left to mine so all the companies that mine end up bankrupt


It‚Äôs a self feeding loop of doom, the more they mine, the more expensive it becomes and the less there is left to mine. That doesn‚Äôt even include the part where mining costs exceed the actual payout.

1355,wallstreetbets,"You might have heard that Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett, among other ultra rich billionaires are criticizing Bitcoin and other decentralized technologies. Bill Gates, for examples saying NFTs are worthless and more.

I understand that the technology is still in it's infancy, but it's benefits are real nevertheless. Why would we want to keep a system that allows a handful of people to control the faith of the entire planet instead of embracing a new and powerful technology that gives this control back to everyone in general without loosing momentum and allows peer-to-peer transactions without the need of a intermediary?

Sure, Bitcoin might not be a tangible or productive asset, but if everyone in the world uses it, that wouldn't even matter.

Money has never been about its own utility, but on our trust in it and what it might represent. Thought history, money has had many faces. Cowrie shells, leather, paper, bits and bytes are a few popular cases of money without intrinsic value that have been adopted by the masses and work incredibly well to represent tangible and productive assets of all kinds.

I honestly don't understand why so many of us are trying to stop a new form of money to be embraced when it is clear that it is more reliable, can be faster and easier to use.

What irritates me the most is that people against this change are usually ignorant or so greedy that they are ok poisoning billions of people with unhealthy products like Coca-Cola and lobbying in favor of their own benefit even when that means they will harm the environment and others.

We've all seen the power of Reddit and its community with GameStop and other wild cases. Let's start buying and using Bitcoin everywhere. Let's liberate ourselves from the few and take back our own power.

This deal ‚Äì the first big biotech IPO of the year ‚Äì¬† is scheduled to price Thursday night (Feb. 2, 2023) to trade Friday (Feb. 3, 2023) on the NASDAQ. In terms of the number of shares, the IPO‚Äôs size is fairly modest: 8.95 million American Depositary Shares (ADS) at $13.00 to $15.00. Jefferies, SVB Leerink, Guggenheim Securities and BMO Capital Markets are the joint book-runners.

Structure Therapeutics is a Cayman Islands-incorporated company with a South San Francisco address. The clinical biopharmaceutical company‚Äôs initial focus is on G-protein-coupled receptors, or GPCRs, as a therapeutic target class. Its proposed stock symbol ‚Äì GPCR ‚Äì matches its therapeutic focus. The company is developing GSBR-1290, its oral small molecule product candidate, to treat Type 2 diabetes (adult onset diabetes mellitus) and obesity.The company began a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose (MAD) study of GSBR-1290, its leading drug candidate, in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity in January. It plans to submit a protocol amendment to the FDA to transition to a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study in T2DM and obesity with expected initiation in the second half of 2023. Structure Therapeutics says that it expects to report topline data for the Phase 1b study and the Phase 2a study in the second half of 2023, the prospectus says.¬†**0 CommentsShareSave**",IPO News,1675380522

When we pushed to $418.31 today we by technical definition ended the bear market‚Ä¶ now there is some discrepancy that you have to close over that level verses just touch it‚Ä¶ but the definition I have seen most commonly uses is price action crossing it.

Tonight we got Google, Amazon and Apple earnings being released. 

Google with a miss on all revenue and Amazon with a miss on q1 net sales, aws net sales and q4 net sales but a beat on subscription sales‚Ä¶. Overall two good sized misses there. 

To be honest Apple actually kinda missed in a pretty impressive way here‚Ä¶ realistically besides china q1 they shit the bed on this one. 

Markets still pretty red here on SPY right now.

We also have a wildcard of data in the morning with nonfarm payrolls, unemployement rate and average hourly rate. Last time we got this data we had a 1%+ green open. Historically last year any unemployment data days opened us with +/- 1%. The issue is that premiums and IV already has that priced in. For instance for Friday DTE puts/ calls they are about 2x their normal value already. 

Thank brings me to my next interesting thing from today‚Ä¶

We saw IV hit a pretty incredible level intraday today. We at one point going into power hour we actually saw IV hit 70%. Generally speaking IV should be the highest near open and steadily decrease throughout the day. And on a bullish day like today we should see lower than usual IV. However, we actually saw a very steady increase in IV all day long today. Very peculiar. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at SPY daily here you can see that we had a huge run up today. We are forming one of those classic abandoned baby patterns here too‚Ä¶ We could with the help of this Goolgle and Amazon earnings miss see a good sized red day tomorrow. 

Interestingly enough we have now seen 8 out of the last 10 days on SPY close green. And we have seen 6 of those 8 close 1%+ green also. 

From a technical stand point we touched and broke through the bull market line‚Ä¶ by book definition this is now a bull market. What is even more incredible to watch how these algos work is that we dumped $5 as soon as we touched that and broke through. Very impressive.

What I am really keeping an eye on tomorrow is close. Tomorrow we close out that weekly candle. If we close that weekly candle under 408.8 I would be extremely bearish for next week. However, realistically anything over that we could look for some further upside. I am eyeing a potential move up as high as 427.5 before CPI on February 14th. I am not positive that we will get there. As we very well could see this be a top. If you see that August peak there is a soft resistance line at 417.1 which we are currently hard rejecting. WE could very well turn this into a double top here. 

Key SPY Support- 414.8 -&gt; 410.9 -&gt; 406.5

Key SPY Resistance- 416.8 -&gt; 419.5 -&gt; 422.1

Futures putting in a reversal candle here also seeing this 4193 resistance but putting in a new support level at 4145. 

As you can see we are also in this very impressive bull channel right now that at some point is going to break and break very hard.

Much like SPY we are watching some key levels here on the weekly. 

Key weekly support for bulls to defend is 4095 (-1.8%) and key resistance that would make for an even more bullish weekly close is 4220. There still is very much so a road to 4280 here on futures. However, I am not sure if we retest 4095 first or not.

Tesla frustrated me today. I have been holding some 22dte puts. I fully see an opportunity for Tesla to retrace to the 150s. I sold pretty much around the time we broke through 192 resistance today as I full saw a road to touching that 197.2 resistance and continuing this run up. Only to have Tesla completely retrace EOD. 

Granted I would still be very red but with 22dte and this candle formation I would be higher probability of green. 

Looking at tesla here we did finally see the daily 100ema broken and closed over. However this massive gravestone doji here formed a beautiful evening doji star pattern and should lead to a pretty good sized sell off tomorrow. 

I was very interested in playing that, however, the IV was extremely high on 0dte for tomorrow and I was not willing to take a chance with 3 major tech earnings tonight after hours. If we break that blue bull channel support at 181.5 tomorrow I would be interested in a short for next week. 

Key Tesla Support- 187.2 -&gt; 181.5 -&gt; 177.9 -&gt; 173.9

Key Tesla Resistance- 191.7 -&gt; 197.2 -&gt; 201

The conversation of the day is the fact that the VIX closed 4.82% green on a day that SPY also closed green. IT was impressive to see the VIX continue to rise around mid day while SPY also rose. I am not quite sure what to make of that. But it would appear that we have reached a bottom on the VIX for now.

Terrible day here today due to the SPY swing and then closing out that Tesla loser. Slightly red week here so far. See what tomorrow brings though. 

In the end not every day will be green, and not every week will be green. The two puts I got stopped out of this morning followed every one of my rules. I cant be upset when that happens. I also took a very high probability swing that unfortunately did not work out.

What many fail to understand is that nothing is linear in financial markets, profitability versus cash-flow, companies usually restructure and specially companies like Caravans selling second hand vehicles.
The crowding out effect is actually more important - the higher the number of investors piling into a trade/view, the higher the propensity for violent and substantial counter-moves.
Those who shorted CVNA are rushing to cover (see the rally in premarket and during the day) because they are losing a whole lot of money right now.

There has been a flurry of form 4 disposal of shares.  
I don't care if they're indirect or open market, it's obscene how much the leadership has been dumping the past month.  


Here's page one of the insider activity from NASDAQ website.  
[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/team/sec-filings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/team/sec-filings)

Their balance sheet doesn't look too bad, they have over 1B in cash as of last quarter.

https://preview.redd.it/a0qciw6z1ufa1.png?width=2007&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=118cdc6d9155626e08606220b132e3a57e166a5e

&amp;#x200B;

Year over year subscription revenue has increased by 50% for the previous quarter.

https://preview.redd.it/ah08do062ufa1.png?width=2168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=05482a46739d5fa6f1bb8ef13bb7a78d76c5de0e

&amp;#x200B;

Amazing, they've reduced their net loss QoQ from (411 million) to (13.7 million) only.

https://preview.redd.it/c8ipitxx2ufa1.png?width=2189&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=909d4b197603ddd67db8b97a1b62b15b7a2c5b32

&amp;#x200B;

Their cost of revenue has gone a bit, but the way they've narrowed their net income loss overcomes this.

https://preview.redd.it/q6rcgcm83ufa1.png?width=1931&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3f69ac2ac55da5cfec06ea5fe2bf0d928060ac25

Increasing subscriber count! Yea a lot of these might be free or fake accounts.  
The street doesn't care about that though, just whatever half baked number a company can give.  
The upward trend is stalling.  
Last quarter despite the good financials, the stock took an absolute pummeling b/c the conversion from free to paid had slowed down significantly.

https://preview.redd.it/ol760oxd3ufa1.png?width=786&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4081cc3452e122898dadb5cb4130b3ab72cc6e23

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the sub trend and growth by quarter.

Also revenue growth since 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

Also their financial targets for today's earnings.  


https://preview.redd.it/lrzrgkcx3ufa1.png?width=899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=34b448a18e7ec00c33136fc5c4317fd8aea96904

Their outlook/word salad on the last investors' call sounds nice.

So what gives?  
Uptrend trend in volume, revenue and profit.  
Shouldn't this be a bullish play instead?

Normally I agree, but there are three main reasons why I am going with puts on this.

1. There are too many Bhenchods working there.
2. Atlassian has crappy software.
3. I am inversing myself here.

That's all folks.  
If you want to inverse the inverse, feel free to go ahead and jump on calls.  


A lot of tech layoffs have occurred, but not all of those are engineers using JIRA and whatever other ghastly tool they've imposed in the software world.

This is a casino and I just pasted all of those pictures to make myself look like a genius if I get it right, but it also gives me a pass if I get it wrong b/c I did my DD.

1600,wallstreetbets,"If you took a class or two on finance, you'd know that there's limited value in analyzing historical trends in order to forecast future output. You could argue that this is borderline common sense because of all the changing variables that take place, especially for SPY. The variables impacting yesterday's market aren't always the same as today's or tomorrows.

Despite the limitations in this area, I do think **historical trend in volatility**\--namely volatility within the past few months--is with some regard the closest one could get in forecasting future outcomes.

Take for example, the 1-hour chart on SPY:

https://preview.redd.it/2o2v7ll0wtfa1.png?width=1884&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4078f34eb4a20816b1fdcad8e78dbb725ec987b1

Starting with the first arrow to the left (10 Nov 2022), you can see a fairly clear trend around this level of volatility for each of the arrows after. Each of the arrows all share a similar level of volatility that allows the price to stick leading to more buying. However, when volatility goes above this average like seen with the circled items, a pullback happens.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q3p136v50ufa1.png?width=1875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ab09f39dab5c9408ffdd84bf34c620e8143da85b

Judging by the candle seen on the 1 minute chart for yesterday, today's gap up was done by an institution. It takes a shit ton of capital to push the price up this much and while I could be wrong and it could just be retail having a buying frenzy afterhours yesterday and pre-market today, I find it unlikely. If anything, it could be both but I still believe it was an institution(s) behind this increase.

Once they sell, SPY should even out between 405-410 unless subsequent earnings for other companies are big as well. If this is the case, I'd still expect a pullback once earning season is over bringing SPY to 410.

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR:

Expect a pullback on today's price increase here in a few days or after earnings season. When referencing SPY's historical volatility three months back, a noticeable trend can be picked out that serves as threshold in volatility that allows the price to stick and subsequently spawn more buying. However, if volatility supersedes this threshold, a pullback is likely to occur at some point.

Depending on the outcomes for other companies, the pullback can be as early as today or after earnings season. I'd wager an honest valuation of SPY is between 405-410 right now.  If earning season goes well for other companies, 410. However, I don't think it'd be much more than that due to the likely effect interest rates will have three months from now.

1602,wallstreetbets,"Now i‚Äôm a bit short on time i‚Äôm writing this before having to head somewhere shortly, so I‚Äôll be explaining this all from memory with absolutely no proof whatsoever just like any good trader.

My argument for $SI being a buy now (as opposed to a couple weeks ago when i was bearish on it) is a couple of factors. First, the reasons not to buy. Well of course the crypto market going down the drain was one of those reasons the company was doing recently poor compared to other quarters, however the crypto market seems to be in a potential recovery (short term anyhow). 

The second argument against buying $SI was their entanglement with various crypto exchanges the most notorious being FTX. However with the healing of the market and crypto-sphere, FTX‚Äôs own holding that SBF gambled with may also recover, dampening the damage caused by SBF, possibly even his own troubles to a large degree.

Now my next three arguments aren‚Äôt related to reasons why you shouldn‚Äôt have bought $SI in the past, but reasons that signal you may want to give it a second glance at least in the short-term, for a potential squeeze.

I‚Äôll make these ones shorter, the first is that BlackRock just divulged their buying of a large stake in $SI this past week. Today Statestreet also divulged a large recently bought holding, while Citadel did in the $20 range a couple weeks ago. While they may all have their hands in many pies and this isn‚Äôt a signal that it‚Äôs a sure bet, these two things do signal some form of large institutional backing‚Ä¶again at least in the short term.  Further, $SI is indeed a federally insured bank. The Fed does NOT like seeing fed members fail, it causes a loss of confidence. 

Now, with all of this considered, the major plot point. $SI is over %60 short, as the most shorted stock on the market as of now. 

We now have a federally insured crypto-bank, with large recent institutional backing and interest, large short interest, during a potential crypto bull run. With that said, depending on your risk tolerance this could be a good **bet**, personally i think this thing is primed to squeeze even more despite its recent run up.

With that said there are still risks, such as possible unlawful activity by the bank. So as always, do your own research and look into it. This is not a sure thing and there is risk.",Why I think the Squeeze on Silvergate (SI) hasn‚Äôt even begun.,1675368545

1765,wallstreetbets,"Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

The average comprises 14 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $120 to a high of $220, with a standard deviation of $26.79. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 6.4% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 95% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.

While the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.

But, for BABA, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.",Wall Street Analysts Think Alibaba (BABA) Could Surge 31.5%,1675361469

Apple went up today 3% just because the market felt bullish, so how would it move on earnings news, well definitely 3-6%

Today this move made feb 17 160 calls go up 200%, so from just a 3% move we got a 200% move in calls, if it was puts it would be 200% there, what im saying is we know the earnings will be volatile and go crazy in either direction, RIGHT NOW, implied volatility is low and it would sky rocket any options in either direction after earnings if it goes in there way.

So to play this volatility we can get the AAPL $140 2/17 Put option, and the AAPL $160 2/17 Call option which are both trading at relatively the same price

SO IF YOU WANT TO GET RICH QUICK JUST BUY BOTH HEAVILY, it will be a strangle based on the volatility of apple, the chance of failure is 0%, theta won't destroy your position if it goes Apple somehow goes flat, because these expire 2/17, and if Apple goes up or down 3%+ (WHICH IT WILL) you will probably make money on this from what I've deduced from my 4 minutes of research, if it goes sideways you barely lose any money. THIS LITERALLY CANNOT GO TITS UP, if you get rich on this play just give me 69 cents and we'll call it even.

All these meme companies owe more debt than their valuations. Just those 3 companies alone owe 40 billion in debt. The ability for them to declare bankruptcy would trigger massive losses to the creditors. My estimate would be hundreds of billions of debt liability loss when you combine all the zombie companies.

Wouldn't the creditors have substantial interests in causing squeezes? To prop the market valuations higher so they continue operating as zombie companies.

We're building a protocol that allows you to trade the outcome of quarterly earnings. The days of cursing at the market gods for being right on fundamentals, wrong on price action are soon to be over. Think TSLA is going to beat on revenues? Take a position with a payoff tied directly to the earnings surprise instead of how price *could* respond to the beat.

If you express similar grievances, we'd appreciate any feedback on product features you would be interested in (i.e., revs, EPS, iPhone sales, etc.).

1845,wallstreetbets,"While our love-hate relationship with daddy Powell continues, I think we are in the most important decade in economic history, if not *human* history. Before the 2008 crisis, the playbook for economic cycles was pretty straightforward: fiscal/monetary stimulus to help the economy grow, let it spiral out of control to red-hot inflation, pull the handbrakes with monetary/fiscal tightening, suffer some devastating years of austerity/deflation/crises, and after some economic/political turmoil/riots, rinse and repeat.

But since the time of Bernanke, there has been a beginning of change in perspective, as to the limits and role of the Central Bank: before, it was just an agency *reacting* to the circumstances and hoping for the best. Even Volcker era was more about rushing to respond to the inflationary crisis, rather than *engineer* the economics itself. It could only be achieved by practically destroying the economy, twice. But things have changed drastically since the time of Bernanke, Yellen and Powell: now they have, whether intentionally or not, created an entirely new era of Central Banking, an era in which CB *decides* what it wants from the Economy.

Of course, it is still no exact science, and there are so many jagged edges and rough heuristics than precise formulae that guide the Central Banks. But it is not the devastating chaos of the prior crises, whether 2020, 2008, 1998, 1987, 1970s.

It all hinges on what happens this year: if the Feds can show, that despite the extremely lax and loose policy since 2008, despite pumping the US and as a consequence global economy with so much liquidity that people don't know what to do with it (at least, the ultra-rich people) - despite all that debauchery, if they can bring down this sudden inflation spiral under control, into nothing more than a ""brief episode"" of 2022-mid 2023, then really, this would be the greatest achievement in Economics in human history. US labour is way more resilient and ""alive"" than the ""lost generation"" of Japan, where a similar approach has failed and now they are just on an excruciating slow path to disaster. We are moving into an era of engineered Economics, something that BOJ failed to achieve. And if USA can achieve it, it can become the new template of modern Economics. It might underscore the importance of having a diverse, thriving community, in contrast to the closed-off, ultra-nationalistic sentiment still brewing all over the world, and just save humanity from annihilating itself.

You know, until the coming Climate Crisis and scarcity of all kinds of Resources.","If the Feds manage to tame inflation this year, they would usher in an unprecedented new era of Economics.",1675357883

Where my question comes up is in the following.
Say on average every1 account is used by 3 people.. when they share ban, are people actually going to stop paying for Netflix? Or will the 2 people who lost it have some of them decide to pay for Netflix? 
The currently subscription doesn't go down and some people now have to buy in would overall mean more I come.

And frankly I don't see people who are already paying for it being mad enough that the mooch on the account loses access that they get rid of their own account.

2089,wallstreetbets,"Hello All,

I have coded a tool in Pine Script (the coding language of Trading View) which gives the probability of a move in % for any asset.

**Why is knowing the probability important?**  
Because trading options becomes a process driven exercise and not an exercise based on gut feeling alone. However, knowing the probability doesn't mean it will guarantee the outcome (a Win or Loss). It does guarantee that over time, your wins and losses will be closer to the probabilities that you trade. For example, if a move has a probability of 95%, it doesn't guarantee that it will happen, because there's still a 5% chance that it won't. But, if over time you trade **ONLY** 95% probability events, your wins will be closer to 95%!

**How does knowing the probability help with trading options?**  
So the options market prices the options based on probabilities. There's a theory that the sum of the premiums of the call and put options for the **AT THE MONEY (ATM) strike**, divided by the strike price, gives a fairly decent estimate of the expected move in the underlying. **For example, the strike price of an asset is 500, and the 500 call option has a premium of 10 and the 500 put option has a premium of 10, the total premium is 20. This total premium is then divided by the strike price of 500 to give a percentage of 4%. That is the move the options market expects in the asset on either side**. Note, there are multiple sources which say that the total premium to be used ranges from 75 - 95% to estimate the expected percentage move in the asset. I prefer to use 100% of the total premium, as it gives some cushioning. So once we figure out the expected move by the options market, we can use that to figure out the probability of the move happening based on my tool.

# For the Option Buyers in AMZN

As AMZN results are expected post market hours today, the options market expects a move of about 7.6% for the options expiring on the 3rd of Feb. And as per my tool on Trading View, **the probability of AMZN moving more than 7.5% by the 3rd of Feb. is only 18% (See Image Below).** That means, there's high probability (82%) that you will lose money if the market does not move by at least 7.5% by the 3rd of Feb.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 4sgxxnj36sfa1...*

**However, as I said earlier, this only gives the probability of the move happening, it does not guarantee that a move will happen or not. A very good example - META! The options market were expecting a 9.15% move for the options expiring on the 3rd of Feb. The probability of META moving that much was ONLY 4%! But, it still did move waaaaay beyond 9.15%! (See Image Below).**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b76clwr46sfa1.png?width=1490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f887ca3a5dca80b1e6490e88348ea7010d0d360d

**So then how does knowing the probability actually help? What gives?**  
Well, like I said earlier, knowing the probabilities will help over time and bring your wins and losses closer to the probabilities you trade. **For example, when probabilities of events happening are low, the options for those assets can be written using credit spreads or naked (depending on one's risk appetite). The premium from these credit trades can be used to to buy options or debit spreads (depending on one's preference) in assets whose probabilities are much higher.**

**Note - the trades here will always be short straddles (sell the CE and PE at ATM strike, in equal quantities), when selling, and long strangles (buy the CE and PE at strikes that are 1 - 2 strikes away from ATM, in equal quantities), when buying.**

**The options market priced NFLX to move about 1.55% for the options expiring on the 3rd of Feb. That is a 95% probability event! (See Image Below).**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/11erxb366sfa1.png?width=1490&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8e7088774e597bc0f6763702abc139c113aba141

So a prudent trade would have been to short META ATM CE and PE options and long NFLX CE and PE options 1 - 2 strikes away from the ATM. (A short straddle on META ATM Strike and a Long Strangle on NFLX, 1 - 2 strikes away from ATM). And yes, the META trade would/will give a massive loss, but it would be a 3X or 4X of the premiums credited. However, if NFLX does move over 1.6% (either side) before the expiry on the 3rd of Feb., the NFLX debit trade could yield a 2X or 3X.

The above was an example of how this tool can effectively be used to trade both the sides. But if someone just wants to buy options, then it makes sense to just trade the high probability trades.

**ENDING NOTE**

The tool that I have coded is still being tested and hence I have not published it on Trading View as yet. It is a private script. However, Redditors can ask me to look up **ANY assets along with the expiry date of the options** and I can give them the probability and will also keep a track of how does it play out. It will help in actually testing out the tool in live markets.

Please let me know if you have any questions!

2110,wallstreetbets,"Silvergate Capital is a financial services company specializing in providing banking services to the digital currency industry. The company has recently seen a surge in short interest, with 78% of its float currently being sold short. This indicates a high level of bearish sentiment among market participants, who are betting that the stock price will decline.

However, recent developments have sparked some optimism among investors. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, recently announced that it has taken an interest in the company by purchasing shares in Silvergate. This is seen as a positive sign by many, as BlackRock's reputation for making sound investment decisions gives credibility to Silvergate as a company.

It's worth noting that short interest can be a double-edged sword for a company. While a high level of short interest can be a sign of negative sentiment, it can also lead to a short squeeze if there is unexpected positive news or a sudden increase in demand for the stock. In a short squeeze, short sellers are forced to buy shares to cover their positions, driving the stock price higher.

In conclusion, while the high level of short interest in Silvergate Capital may be cause for concern, the recent interest from BlackRock is a positive development that could potentially boost investor confidence in the company. As with any investment, it's important to carefully consider all relevant factors before making a decision.

WISH rose 3.94% after it cuts nearly 17% of global workforce. Meanwhile, Wish introduces flat rate shipping to customers in the U.S. The move is part of a broader effort to improve the shipping experience on Wish which has, in the past 6 months alone, seen a dramatic improvement in on-time delivery rates (94%) and a significant reduction in time to door (15 days in key markets). Given the catalyst of cost cutting and improved shipping experiences, together with trending down inflation, Wish is positioned well to outperform the market in the near term.

Meta shares popped 20.17% in the after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter revenue that topped estimates and announced a $40 billion stock buyback. Here are the results.

* Earnings: $1.76 per share vs $2.22 expected  

* Revenue: $32.17 billion vs $31.53 billion expected  

* Daily Active Users (DAUs): 2 billion vs 1.99 billion expected  

* Monthly Active Users (MAUs): 2.96 billion vs 2.98 billion expected  

* Average Revenue per User (ARPU): $10.86 vs $10.63 expected

The company expects that its total expenses in 2023 will be in the range of $89 billion to $95 billion, which is lower than its prior outlook of $94 billion to $100 billion for the year. Meta attributed the adjustment to ‚Äúslower anticipated growth in payroll expenses and cost of revenue.‚Äù The cost cutting is what many investors are looking for and that partially explains why the stock is rising 20% in the after hour trading.

**Opportunities**

Market rises after the Federal Reserve raised rates by 25 basis points, or 0.25%, as was widely expected on Wednesday.

Why M/A is likely over BK

1, Intentional ABL default- the ABL/FILO agent only enacted 2nd and 3rd actions against BBBY and have not activated the 1st action which is complete termination of the ABL agreement. This ensures that chase bank is first in line for payment while BBBY is only in technical default.

2, David Kastin hiring as chief legal officer who has had significant experience with merger and acquisitions.

3, Carol Flaton hired to the board, again with extensive M/A experience and in a statement it says she will be paid for a private unknown time frame much like the time it would take to M&amp;A, whether if they were going BK they wouldn't need this timeframe, also the upfront payment of her fees makes no sense seeing as how chapter 11 BK can last months-years.

1. Strong financial performance: Cal-Maine Foods has a long history of strong financial performance, consistently increasing revenue and profits over the years. This makes it an attractive investment option for those looking for stable returns.
2. Growing demand for eggs: The demand for eggs and egg products will continue to grow in the coming years, driven by factors such as an increasing population and rising health consciousness. This bodes well for Cal-Maine Foods, as it is the US's largest producer and marketer of fresh eggs.
3. Diversification benefits: Investing in Cal-Maine Foods can provide diversification benefits for individuals looking to diversify their portfolios. The company operates in a different sector from other common investments, such as tech stocks; therefore, its performance may not be correlated with other investments.
4. Strong market position: Cal-Maine Foods has a strong market position, being the largest producer and marketer of fresh eggs in the US. This gives the company economies of scale and a competitive advantage over its rivals.

2181,wallstreetbets,"Hi guys,
It is not a very interesting story so bear with me. I always felt interested in stock trading and ended up on this sub. It was fun and pretty lucrative to see all loss/profit porn. It just made it look, how easily you can lose/win. I unfortunately started trading last year March. It was very addictive and I could not keep my self away from it even working full time. I ended up year with a minor net profit. However, starting this year, I have realised how draining it is to keep up with all events. I was already invested in long term options and still hold some bags which are barely 2k Euro and I am fine with it.
Now you may ask why I am thanking you guys? Its because you guys have showed me what exactly money is. I come from a poor background and made some good monies. But I was stingy, always not spending on the things i even needed. Never pampering my self or treating my self. However, while taking small hits (50‚Ç¨,30‚Ç¨ etc) I realised that its nothing as compared to what I have achieved. But if I dont be careful, I might fall back right where I started so I kept my plays very short. I also made small profits. So fear of spending or losing had gone drastically down. At the same time, I had learned risk management. So I didn‚Äôt lose much. 
However, its not for me as I find it very draining. So I am quitting and going back to building up a small business (that‚Äôs where my savings same from). 

So all ya regards, thanks for teaching me, I can make big or I can lose big. But one can earn money as far as we observe the risk management rules and stick to it.
I am quitting trading as of today, with net profit of 1000‚Ç¨ ü§ë and I am going to treat my self with a nice weekend away.

‚Ä¢I am a firm believer that the key to success is to focus on quality first and profit second. With Netflix's actions they will take against password sharing in March, I think that Netflix will become wildly unpopular. Their method of preventing password sharing will also likely lead to many frustrating situations that will leave customers feeling it's not worth the struggle.
‚Ä¢I think many families or friends will use alternative streaming services that allow password sharing even if they find Netflix superior, as it can be convenient to spread the cost of watch the same selection of shows and movies and discuss them.
‚Ä¢I think that the streaming services market is becoming oversaturated, and that Netflix will loose it's edge as people become more willing to try out many similar services.
‚Ä¢I think Apple will find ways to promote their streaming service on their devices and make it harder for Netflix to reach it's audience.
‚Ä¢I think the recession will be worse than many expect and that Netflix will be cut out of the budget of many consumers.
‚Ä¢I don't think the federal funds rate is properly factored into many tech stocks that have relied on nearly free borrowing such as Netflix.
‚Ä¢Growth companies rely on infinite growth, and if that growth is over the company already has a foot in the grave. Netflix is clearly reaching it's limit so all they have left to do is try to milk more out of their current subscribers which as I said earlier will cause discontent and a lower quality product.",Why I'm short Netflix,1675319941

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.82 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 58% and 79%. (Stats as of 2022-12-31)",2023-02-02 Wrinkle-brain Plays (Mathematically derived options plays),1675310743

2273,wallstreetbets,"$MARA looks like it will be a winner over the next few weeks.  We could get a mega squeeze any day or it could just churn higher as it rebounds from oversold conditions.  The thesis is as follows:

* $MARA is the 4th most shorted stock on the Nasdaq, with 46% of the float shorted.  Cost to borrow is hovering around 70 ‚Äì 110%.  The company is down 90% off its highs of $80.  Market cap is $800M.  Zero shares available to short.  All good dynamics for a squeeze.
* Dovish Fed at 25 bps is allowing money to move back into all high beta tech stocks (the wind is at our backs).  There‚Äôs a record 5 trillion in cash in money market accounts sitting on the sidelines.  Funds will be flowing into the market over the next few weeks.  Thanks J Pow Pow!
* Bitcoin just hit a YTD high of over $24k.  $MARA is tied to the price of $BTC.  Historically, as BTC goes up, MARA goes up much more.
* $MARA had an abysmal quarter last quarter which tanked the price.  It was hit from all sides: FTX bankruptcy, bitcoin price collapse, and operational challenges around one of their mining facilities caused major short term headwinds for the business.  As a result, last quarter‚Äôs results were disappointing, leading prices to fall to under $4.  Prices have begun to recover, but are well below the $18 level that $MARA was trading at in August when BTC was at $23k.
* $MARA appears to have worked through their operational issues and are back to mining at full speed (7 E/Hs) as of December!  More importantly, they expect to grow their mining capacity from 7 E/Hs to 23 E/Hs in 2023.  This means the company will triple bitcoin production and will be generating an estimated 24,000 BTC per year by mid year.  I‚Äôm looking forward to their January production update which should be out early next week.
* The company recently announced a partnership with a UAE firm to open a facility overseas.  We don‚Äôt know that much about this deal, but I like to see them making new strategic long term partnerships with well capitalized partners.  I believe their capex requirements for this facility are minimal.  Need more info on all this, but it seems bullish overall.
* Blackrock recently increased their position in the company to 7%.  Again, a very well capitalized partner and nice to see them doubling down on $MARA and on $BTC.
* Lastly, the stock has a bit of familiarity amongst the retail stock crowd, so I could see folks piling in once the move up starts.  There are not a lot of options to get crypto exposure from a brokerage account and $MARA is at the top of the list.

2314,wallstreetbets,"Today Jpow stuck to his late 2022 narrative: we don't care if the economy tanks, we need to stabilize prices.  this time around, the market was expecting it- and not in fear.  over the past 3 months, the data has pointed to a soft landing more effectively than at any point since hiking began.  

jpow admitted that inflation was falling faster than the fed had anticipated, and he was projecting optimism- uncharacteristic of late.  he behaved almost politically at times, relishing in the opportunity to say ""my plan is working.  my legacy is materializing.""  the market loved this positive jpow and joined him in his victory lap, although jpow stated explicitly that the battle against inflation is nowhere near over.  

jpow applauded and nurtured the notion, held in both the financial markets and among businesses/consumers, that inflation is coming down and will not be a problem in the future, embracing the self-fulfillingness of such a belief.

this moment feels like a major turning point in the 2022-3 bear market.  whether it is or not remains to be seen.  the bond market received jpows words as an endorsement of their own optimism.  he even validated the idea that rate cuts are on the table in 2023, but only in the extreme long-shot (in the feds eyes) that inflation rapidly falls near 2%.

it is important to note that jpow has not changed his tune whatsoever.  if inflation shows signs of persisting or resurging, jpow will still be willing, as he has steadfastly declared over and over, to cause the economy as much pain as necessary to maintain price stability.  in this respect, there has been no pivot.

also, to no surprise of anyone who's been paying attention, the market is pricing in quite a soft landing.  i wouldn't be surprised to see this current optimism bring the market to dangerous heights in the near term.  i will repeat jpow's message today: ""we're well on the right track, but we are not fucking there yet.""  the market, however, may be willing to believe that we are already there.

to everyone who traded 0dte options today: good for you, soldier, for jumping in, even if you're nothing more now than bones on the sea floor.  these fomc days are a top-tier shitshow.  i was surprised by the 9:30-2pm action; trading was much less rangebound than i had imagined.  IV was so low that theta decay was showing its face much more than usual.  also, there was a suspicious IV crush around 1:50pm.

the 2:10ish shrek dildo (although it looks like nothing now) made me say ooh boy that was bullish, especially as it was by far the biggest move since the 2pm release. i'd guess that even if jpow didn't fan the flames at all, we were going to rally to days highs at least.  but he did and now the bulls are in control.  sry bears. rip cassandra's twitter (LOL).

2- Sell long VIX Futures when VIX Closes above 25. 
3- Keep repeating.
4-If by end of any month VIX remains below 25 (no sell signal) roll Futures forward by 1 month. 

So for example currently we would be long VIX Futures April 23. If feb ends without VIX closing below 25, we would roll Futures to June 23, and so on.

Unlike Microsoft which saw declines in Cloud demand, Amazon stock price get's it's strength from growth evident from their high P/E. AWS is the bread and butter for Amazon. Has the decline in cloud demand shown in MSFT earnings been priced in the past week? I think not. Don't kid yourself that Amazon has taken market share from Microsoft.

I have a theory this company is about to get shorted heavily, by some big bankers. They have done something that angered a very big sports team owner and his friends.   


Details below 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a major sports team owner in America that has been backing a failed effort of his friend to operate a start up, based on a hobby, since about 2005ish. This sports team owner is one of the states biggest money makers and he is tied in with sports, racing and world bankers. This guy is well known and worth a lot of money.     


Recently, their little pet project company had a competitor announce something big that was a threat to their business model.  When I checked google trends and some other resources, I could see searches for their competitors stock shot through the roof, originating from the sports owners home state.  Everything else in the country remained grey, meaning nobody but one particular state had been searching or, even cared about their stock.  Believe me, once you know what it is, you wouldn't have cared up until this point.   


Now, I am a nobody, a nothing compared to the genius that resides in this reddit.  But, I think this major sports team owner and his connected banker friends are intentionally trying to kill their competitors company through shorting it.   They want to force this competitor to sell to them or, kill it before the recent development gets completed. ''Trust me'', there is only room for one big player in their little hobby, to make money.    


Due to who I am, who I know within that world, I am being somewhat cryptic.  If anyone would be willing to msg me, I will get you the details and you can choose whether or not to ''go public'' on here with that information and get everyone involved.    


This is extremely early on in what's happening so, I added the details below just so you can see market cap and current short interest. Yes I know, not that high yet.   


I don't who if this worth your time, you people take on big fish. I am willing to show anyone willing to listen. Just, when it's released it cannot be tied to me. Not for legal reasons, more for how well known I am.  Back in 05-07, we were their competitor and they took us out by buying up licensing to dry us out.  We had investors that couldn't stick it out.   


I think they are planning to short this company to kill it. I don' t think this company will sell, even if it means death.

2431,wallstreetbets,"As requested, here are my thoughts on AMZN's earnings call after market tomorrow. Personally, I think what's gonna happen is this. Amazon misses on EPS, maybe by 3-4 ish cents. They beat revenue, not by a huge amount, but they beat it. Their guidance for first quarter is gonna be the kicker. And I'm betting that they give us some beautiful guidance. 

Given this, let's look at Dataroma and see if there are any potential flags as to whether good or bad earnings. In the past month, there have been absolutely no sales or buys. Looking a bit farther, 3 month timespan, a total of 8 million in shares has been sold. This to me doesn't indicate anything, considering it's from 3 different people, most likely just some payment for themselves. 

Also, idk how much this could affect the earnings outcome on the stock price, but it makes sense in my head. Maybe after the fed meeting today people are going to be more open/more impulsive so they would be more willing to buy in rather then do nothing or sell. Assuming good guidance is given, I think AMZN is gonna rise. And Meta showed that Snap was an isolated incident, and not indicative of the entire adspace based market.

Tldr: I think AMZN has a good earnings led by some sexy guidance for Q1, and I think they will also beat revenue. Probably miss on EPS, but negligible in light of a revenue beat and good guidance. So my money is on Calls. What do y'all think?",AMZN yolo?,1675293386

The fund manager of ""The Big Short"" fame was likely urging investors not to be fooled by the recent rebound in stocks. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index gained 6.2% in January, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 11%, marking its best January performance since 2001.

Some of the hardest-hit stocks last year have led the charge upward. Elon Musk's Tesla notched a 41% gain in January, making it the second-best performer in the S&amp;P 500, while Cathie Wood's flagship Ark Innovation fund recorded its best month ever. Burry's Scion Asset Management fund placed bets against both the automaker and the tech-focused fund in 2021, and the investor took aim at both Musk and Wood in tweets.

Investors dumped tech stocks years after a historic spike in inflation spurred the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates from nearly zero to north of 4%, in a bid to curb the pace of price increases. They have piled back into them this year, as they believe inflation is waning and the Fed will soon pivot to cutting rates, which could revitalize demand and allow the US economy to escape a recession.

Burry has been pouring cold water on the stock rally this year. On January 23, he tweeted a chart showing the S&amp;P 500's plunge during the dot-com crash, and circled in red its rally between September 2001 and March 2002 before it bottomed six months later. The implication was that the S&amp;P 500's 17% rally since last October's low could also prove short-lived.",Michael burry tweeted ‚Äúsell‚Äù 10 hours prior to the feds meeting didn‚Äôt age very well,1675291138

And really it is the end of about a 100 year cycle going back to the 29-33 crash.

Firstly, the stock has been forming a strong uptrend with higher highs and higher lows, indicating that buyers are in control of the market. Additionally, the stock has recently broken out of a bullish symmetrical triangle pattern, which is a strong indication of further price appreciation. The volume has also increased significantly during the break out, showing increased demand for the stock.

Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also in the bullish zone, above 50, indicating that the stock is not overbought. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is also showing a bullish crossover, indicating that the momentum is shifting in favor of the bulls.

In conclusion, the technical analysis supports the bullish outlook for Carvana and suggests that the stock is likely to continue its upward trajectory in the short to medium term.

Lets take a look at what was said during FOMC. 

¬∑ We got a 25bps hike as expected

¬∑ ""The Committee anticipates that **ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate** in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.""

¬∑ POWELL: FULL EFFECTS OF RAPID TIGHTENING YET TO BE FELT

¬∑ Powell: The labor market is out of balance.

¬∑ Powell: Inflation is still too high.

¬∑ POWELL: REDUCING INFLATION LIKELY TO REQUIRE BELOW-TREND GROWTH

¬∑ Powell: We will stay the course until our job is done.

¬∑ POWELL: WE'RE NOT YET AT SUFFICIENTLY RESTRICTIVE POLICY STANCE

¬∑ Powell: So far we see progress \[in disinflation\] without any degradation in the labor market.

¬∑ Powell: Would be premature to declare victory.

¬∑ POWELL: FED DISCUSSING A **COUPLE MORE HIKES** TO RESTRICTIVE LEVEL

¬∑ POWELL: **FED NOT EXPLORING PAUSING THEN RESTARTING RATE HIKES**

¬∑ Powell: The market has decided inflation will go down...and that is a very positive thing.

¬∑ **FED SWAPS PRICE IN 50BP OF RATE CUTS BY YEAR END FROM JUNE PEAK**

So lets break this down here‚Ä¶ 

There is a bullish narrative that the fed is going to cut rates (pivot) by end of year. JPOW is also alluding that there is disinflation happening already. Now for me this was an incredible market over reaction. I do not think the market is really this delusional. 

Lets take a look at what JPOW ACTUALLY said‚Ä¶ he said there will be a COUPLE more rate hikes‚Ä¶ that means there will be 2-3 more rate hikes‚Ä¶ that means they are targeting fed funds rate of 4.5% to 4.75% to be somewhere around 5%-5.25% to 5.25% to 5.5% before they even considering pausing‚Ä¶ not pivoting‚Ä¶ pausing.

The whole narrative of a fed pause in March is officially over. However there is currently a 65% chance of a pause after this march meeting. JPOW was VERY clear that we are going to hold with rate increases until he feels confident that we conquered inflation which he doesn‚Äôt think we are. The fact also that markets are crazy enough to predict that there will be 50bps of rate hikes by EOY is beyond nuts to me. 

Now we have seen this time and time again on FOMC where the markets rip us intraday and we give it all up and some the next day.

Besides Julys FOMC the post-FOMC day has opened red every single time averaging a 0.92% red open. I would be pretty shocked honestly to not see a red open tomorrow. However, IF we were to see a green open tomorrow that would send a pretty clear message to where we are headed for the next 2-3 weeks.

We have a very large data dump in the morning again too. Lots and lots of job data. Interestingly enough is that this is now the 2nd month in a row where they are calling for a lower jobless claims data‚Ä¶ we used to be expecting around 220-225k jobless claims but they are now only calling for 195k which is up from the previous 188k. Tomorrow pre market will be very interesting. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/45akbtevenfa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2b83ea89b79e81f63e23310b1f625bbe1825f3a0

Zoomed as much out as I could here to show you guys exactly whats we are looking at here‚Ä¶ 

We have now officially broke over and closed over the key resistance of 410.4 from Decembers CPI. Today was also the highest price action SPY has seen since August 26th (Jackson hole day). This is also only the 2nd time we have closed over 408 since August 25th. 

Todays high of day brought us within $4.07 of breaking through the trend line that officially would signal that the bull market is over. If the bulls kept this momentum up‚Ä¶ It would be possible for them to touch that level tomorrow. 

We have broken through the blue bull channel and now are in a black bull channel. This is an extremely steep bull channel too. 

As much as I could see a potential for us to reach 419.6 which is the top from August I do not think that will happen. I do think that tomorrow we are going to see a retrace and retesting of 405.3. 

The one thing that I have learned is that when price action rises as extreme as it did today without confirming volatility on the way up its is extremely likely to give it all up the next day. There is a very large untouched gap from that 413.7 top all the way down to 406.2. If bears take this back down tomorrow and they hold that 405.3 to 406.2 support then I would look for a push up but this is unlikely to continue this run up much longer.

Tomorrow is going to be a very very interesting day to watch. 

Key SPY Support- 406.5 -&gt; 405.3 -&gt; 402.9

Key SPY Resistance- 410.8 -&gt; 413.8 -&gt; 417.1

&amp;#x200B;

Futures also broke through its blue bull channel resistance. While SPY did see its highest level since August like I said, futures due to its 24/6 trading has NOT seen those levels broken. Despite this incredible push up we did not break through the December CPI high of 4180. However, Futures is attempting to close over key resistance of 4138 from the September high. 

Key Futures Support- 4138 -&gt; 4095 -&gt; 4085

Key Futures Resistance- 4180 -&gt; 4235

Taking a look at tesla here you can see that we are holding onto that daily 100ema. We came up smacked it nearly on the nose and then hard rejected for a slighy EOD retrace. Tesla is maintaining that blue bull channel support now. 

I mentioned that key levels to watch on Tesla were 185.1 and 197.2. If the market doesn‚Äôt react bearishly as I am expecting then we are likely to see those levels reached. 

However, if the markets digest this news bearishly overnight as I suspect they will then this daily 100ema rejection here is going to be a great potential top. 

Key Tesla Support- 177.8 -&gt; 173.9 -&gt; 164.5

Key Tesla Resistance- 185.3 -&gt; 191.7 -&gt; 197.2

And then there was the VIX‚Ä¶ a very impressive -8% day here on the VIX‚Ä¶ now the most notable thing is that we broke back into the 17s and not only that closed at 17.86 which is the lowest close that the VIX has had since January 12th 2022. 

Looking at the last month of trading pretty much any time the VIX has touched the 17s we have seen a top on the markets. 

A pretty massive unwind like this on the VIX would not surprise me to see a recoil back up tomorrow. However, it is clear the fear is leaving the markets. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2utjy2z2fnfa1.png?width=809&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8d4a586fe27cb8e6594754e7b6c1e24a74e35d99

And the last piece of the puzzle that I haven‚Äôt talked about in a long time is‚Ä¶ the fear and greed index. 

We are currently sitting at a level of 73. Which is about as close to extreme greed as one can get. This is officially the highest level the FG has been in over a year. 

I know a lot of people want to be extreme bullish here and think we are in a bull market again and that ATH are coming but I would not be going long on calls here‚Ä¶ if I had to chose a play 60-90dte puts and slowly build a position would be my choice. Unless we get some sort of meaniful pullback to 390. If we were to retest 390 and hold that well I would consider calls for another run up. I could actually even entertain that idea at 400 spy too‚Ä¶. But up here bulls are playing with fire. 

**Daily log-**

no update here.. I for the first time in I honestly cant even remember when did not take a trade‚Ä¶ and honestly‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt be any happier. I had thought about Swing SPY calls but called off that idea with the EOD pump and im glad I did! I also wouldn‚Äôt have expected an $11+ pop after JPOW started talking and would have surely gotten burnt in puts. 

I told myself to sit out FOMC and CPI for the next few meetings and so far it has been a good play. 

I am still in Tesla puts that are down slightly here. 23dte so I am not worried. Will look close to 14dte to average down if I still believe in the play.",We have finally reached 410‚Ä¶ 2-1-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis (and FOMC review),1675288425

I believe the strongest arguments against bitcoin are that it runs on a distributed computer and computer memory is vulnerable to corruption (nation-state level magnet manipulation) and that it can be 51% attacked.

Please let me know your thoughts and if you have interest in using this domain to play this market position.",nobitcoin.org domain,1675286695

2537,wallstreetbets,"I thought the market was going to spike briefly and then drop after JP's speech so I set up a short vertical spread with two triggers (a stop-loss and a take-profit). I was way wrong obviously, the market rallied, but somehow my P/L is $17,100???

As you can see I sold ten of March 10 SPX vertical at 4110/4120 strike, at a 6.00 limit. I set a take profit at 3.00 limit to buy back the contract at 50% profit, and a limit stop loss at mark price of the underlying at 4110 with a limit offset of 0.10 just to ensure I would get filled (so that my max loss would be nearly equivalent to the credit I received from the spread).

Anyway it gets filled and the market instantly starts ripping upwards. I was disappointed but did not close early, had already decided to leave emotions out, stick to my strategy, and either let it hit my stop-loss or my take-profit.

So SPX promptly hits 4110 (which was my stop loss) and I go to my positions to see the damage, only to find that not only are ALL THREE of my positions are somehow open, but my profit is over 10k. After a long confused pause I scrambled to close my position.

I entered a closing trade for all 3 and they get filled, but then after looking again to make sure, I still have an open bought vertical somehow?? I fumbled around thinkorswim for two minutes with panic rising and unable to understand WTF I have done, figured I had to just close the position so I picked the opposite of my position and just blindly submitted it at the default mark limit, and it filled quickly.

Now finally with all the positions closed I am looking at $17,100 profit in about ten minutes. What have I done? I don't get it at all. It was a short vertical spread so understand that my MAX PROFIT on this trade should have been 6k, and that was only if SPX stayed below 4110 all the way until March 10th and then the contract expires worthless, which wouldn't have happened anyway because I set a take profit at 50% so my max profit if I absolutely nailed this trade should have been 3k.","Accidentally made 17k on Powell announcement, can someone explain what happened?",1675286236

Please educate me, fellow apes.

I'm not completely smooth brained yet, so there are things I do not understand.

They, like, stole my money dollar cash basically.

I'm using a Cash account by the way, not a Margin one, and yes there are not enough money on that account to actually execute these call options, but I never planned that to begin with, and I fully understand why options get liquidated at expiration date in that case, but not earlier.

2683,wallstreetbets,"RENO, Nev. ‚Äî General Motors Co. has conditionally agreed to invest $650 million in Lithium Americas Corp. in a deal that will give GM exclusive access to the first phase of a mine planned near the Nevada-Oregon line with the largest known source of lithium in the U.S.

The equity investment the companies announced jointly on Tuesday is contingent on the Thacker Pass project clearing the final environmental and legal challenges it faces in¬†[federal court in Reno](https://apnews.com/article/biden-technology-politics-arizona-fish-c857aa30fc88c757b6c9d403bda9f0a8), where conservationists and tribal leaders are suing to block it.

Lawyers for the mining company and the U.S. government told a judge during a Jan. 5 hearing the project is critical to meeting the growing demand for lithium to make electric vehicle batteries ‚Äî a key part of President Joe Biden‚Äôs push to expedite a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

GM said Tuesday's announcement marks the largest-ever investment by an automaker to produce battery raw materials.

Lithium Americas estimates the lithium extracted and processed from the project atop an ancient volcano about 200 miles (321 kilometers) northeast of Reno can support production of up to 1 million electric vehicles annually. It's the third largest known lithium deposit in the world, the company said.

‚ÄúThe agreement with GM is a major milestone in moving Thacker Pass toward production,‚Äù Lithium Americas President and CEO Jonathan Evans said in the joint statement Tuesday.

‚ÄúWe are pleased to have GM as our largest investor and we look forward to working together to accelerate the energy transition while spurring job creation and economic growth in America,‚Äù he said.

GM also reported Tuesday that rising factory output led to strong U.S. sales at the end of last year, pushing its¬†[fourth-quarter net income](https://apnews.com/article/general-motors-co-auto-industry-detroit-business-97a5db2a4e15c45915aae123e0b3d9cb)¬†up 16% over the same period a year ago.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark rate by 0.25%, marking the central bank's second consecutive policy downshift.

At its last meeting, the central bank opted for a 0.5% hike, which was preceded by four straight 0.75% rate hikes.

The Fed will get a look at a myriad of new data before it makes its next decision on rates in late March, the most important being the January CPI print, due two weeks from Wednesday.

As that product gets pushed by youtubers, the brand starting to sponsor the ufc &amp; a pro football team I see the growth in popularity amongs younger demographic all around me. 

I personally saw the product but being in my 30's the appeal isn't really there and I thought 10$ for a bottle of coconut water seemed extra. Fast forward yesterday its the most advertised brand at the mall by my place with ""pre-order here"" signs all over. And that's just in a small canadian city, I can't imagine the impact in the us &amp; england. 

So with that in mind, I am wondering if it's only a fad and will be forgotten about in a year, or is it a legit brand that will get acquired? Whoever buys it out will most likely own a massive cash cow of a product if they can scale the supply to meet demand. 

Either way, I think it's worth investing in coca-cola and pepsi regardless. Both are solid brand. But with a acquisition with this much hype around it, who do you think takes it? Or perhaps an entire other drink company?

The 59-year-old Taiwanese immigrant is coming off a less memorable year, as he was among other tech moguls who lost big money, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla's Elon Musk.

Microsoft this month reportedly invested $10 billion into ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI, which has fueled interest in the artificial intelligence space overall. The bot has shown a capacity for a range of tasks such as writing stock stories, layoff emails, and even dating-app messages.

Nvidia's role as a dominant player in the chip-making space has made it an attractive bet as Wall Street looks to ride the AI trend.

After starting initially with graphics chips used in video games, the company is now involved in making chips for AI applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to robots.¬†

Last week, Citi strategists estimated that ChatGPT's growth could result in sales of $3 billion to $11 billion for Nvidia over the course of a year, per Bloomberg.¬†

The federal reserve will announce either a 25 or a 50 basis points interest rate hike to combat inflation.  
My thought is that the fed will raise it 25 basis points, but then give a Hawkish statement.

The fake government reports are still saying unemployment is low and inflation is hitting the 'estimates' which is basically giving the fed the green light to continue with the rate hikes and Hawkish statements.

Also, Jan had an extremely bullish run being up 6.15% for the month.   
This is the powers that be laying out a nice soft rug to pull later today.

In December, the largest increases in job openings were in accommodation 
and food services (+409,000), retail trade (+134,000), and construction (+82,000). The number of job openings decreased in information (-107,000)

ISM Manufacturing again in contraction mode, and worse than expected - 47.4 vs 48. (Any number below 50 means contraction).

ISM Prices Paid for Manufacturing (proxy for input inflation) in January was hotter than expected 44.5 vs 39.5.

ISM Manufacturing New Orders (proxy for demand) decreased further to 42.5 from 45.1.

ADP Employement much lower than expected around 106K new jobs created vs 178K. However, ADP noted that employment was soft during the January 12 reference week as the US was hit with extreme weather. Hiring was stronger during other weeks of the month, in line with the strength seen late last year.

So the report's 106K was ""wrong"" due to the weather.

On the Fed, yesterday's Conference Board Consumer Sentiment fro Jan 2023 was 107.1 vs 109 expected, so softer, since inflation expectations jumped from 6.6&amp; to 6.8%. https://www.conference-board.org/topics/consumer-confidence.

The ECI Employment Cost Index came in slighter better than expected 1% vs 1.1% expected for Q4 2022.

Europe Inflation 8.5% vs 9% expected, but core worse 5.2% vs 5.1%.
Germany delayed their inflation data by 2 weeks due to a ""technical glitch"".

ADP also released their average hourly wages for Jan 2023 - seems like there's no change in general, though their data might be skewed due to the weather again.

In terms of forward looking data, Walmart will raise wages starting on the March 2 paycheck to $17.50 from $17 (+3%). Around 340,000 workers will have this pay rise. https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/walmart-raise-wages-us-workers-2023-01-24/

Airlines like Delta Airlines and other airlines are in the process of increasing wages.

Cleveland Fed's inflation nowcasting shows January 2023 shows CPI +0.6% MoM and Core +0.5%, which is a huge turnaround from December's CPI of -0.1% MoM. The Fed will not like this - however Cleveland has been ""wrong"" the least 3 times due to the downside surprise from health insurance and medical care services. I doubt this is so again, since the Jan 2023 weights for inflation are reduced for insurance, less for medical, more for rent, more for food, more for recreation, less for used cars.

With this in time, the Fed will most likely be extremely hawkish in their statement. 25bps as most people expect, but I'm slightly worried. They will most likely wait for 6 months inflation data to declare inflation dead.

If the Fed becomes dovish - that's also possible due to the weakening economy - though I doubt it - entertainement and recreation fro Jan 2023 spending increased a lot from my data sources (around +15% from 2019 levels), so it's just cause COVID caused a change from demand in goods to services.",11M vs 10M Job Openings.

# Bull case:

The fitness equipment maker jumped more than 5% in the premarket after reporting fiscal second quarter revenue of $792.7 million, above a Refinitiv forecast of $710 million. Peloton said its net loss narrowed year over year and subscription revenue was higher than sales of the product. (source: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/peloton-pton-q2-earnings-2023.html))

Suggesting that its efforts to boost sales, including by selling on third-party platforms, may be showing results.  The company had announced plans to sell its fitness equipment on e-commerce giant Amazon.com and at Dick's Sporting Goods Inc stores.)

Shares of the fitness equipment maker were up 4% before the bell after it also reported a slowing cash burn on a string of cost-cutting measures.

Cash burn fell to $94.4 million from $546.7 million

# Bear case: 

Peloton was all the rage among fitness enthusiasts during COVID-19 lockdowns, with the company hitting hit a peak market value of nearly $50 billion in early 2021. But with people returning to gyms the company saw demand for its equipment dwindle.

""The business model still has a lot to prove, and further time is need to assess whether it is viable or on a path to further decline,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData.

Peloton said challenging economic conditions were impacting consumer spending patterns and that near-term demand for connected fitness hardware is likely to remain challenged.

My Criteria..  


High Short interest rate.  


CVNA has a 58% short interest.  


Large institutional holding.  


In this case it's listed by various sources as 104-118% ownership.  


That means there is a very limited shares trading (floating) out of the outstanding shares on a daily basis and is ripe for a [Reddit, Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/reddit-com/) type squeeze higher if hedge funds are among the 58% short.  


Four days ago Carvana adopted a poison pill essentially staving off any one investor to come in and buy more than 5% of the company as the stock traded down from $376 in August 2021 to $3.65 on Dec 28, 2022.

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **January 23rd - January 27th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of ‚ÄúP‚Äù or ‚ÄúS‚Äù. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **January 16th - January 20th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

* REC   Silicon is a leader in silane-based, high-purity silicon materials. In   fact, REC is the only large-scale producer of silane gas in U.S. and   Europe.
* Two   highly strategic assets (Moses Lake, Washington and Butte, Montana) in   rapidly expanding industries (megatrends) that should benefit from   lasting political tailwinds and strong profitability outlook. The   industries being solar, semiconductors and batteries (Thus, the   three-legged reference).
* Hydropower-based clean energy and low carbon footprint.
* 15% ownership share of a polysilicon plant in Yulin, China.
* Listed on the Norwegian stock exchange with ticker RECSI. Included in the OBX index which holds the 25 most liquid companies.
* Unknown   to most U.S. retail investors, most likely because it is a Norwegian   company. Workforce are U.S. based, including management and of course   the assets.
* Broke   their neck with the U.S. and China trade wars and their Moses Lake   plant, valued at 1.7 billion USD, had to shut down. And this is where it   gets interesting, because things have changed. The plant is now   scheduled for a restart second half this year, 2023! **So, what happened?**

**Six big things happened.**

1. The   world has changed, caused by geopolitical tension, and disruption in   supply chains, such as semiconductors and solar, poses a risk to   national security. More and more protectionism are introduced in both   the U.S. and Europe, and we are witnessing the importance of domestic   manufacturing and supply chains.
2. The   Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law in 2022, resulting  in  REC Silicon receiving a credit of $3 per kg polysilicon produced -   approximately 50 mUSD per year.
3. The   Chips and Science got signed into law. Spurred by the passage of this   bill we see a huge boost in the American semiconductor industry. REC   Silicon\`s facility in Butte, MT, has been recognized by the White House   as a potential candidate for domestic expansion of silane gas  production  ([https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/](https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/)).
4. Senate   Bill 5849 by Judy Warnick, Moses Lake. Extending a targeted 43%   business and occupation tax cut for manufacturers of solar panels and   components another five years past the original expiration date of 2027   to 2032. In addition, the bill would allow for the construction or   improvement of existing industrial buildings.
5. Hanwha   Group, more specific Hanwha Solutions and Hanwha Corporation, recently   became the biggest shareholders in REC Silicon, now controlling 33%.   Hanwha Q CELLS, another company under the Hanwha umbrella, is one of the   world's largest and most recognized manufacturers for its  high-quality,  high efficiency solar cells and modules. Q CELLS recently  announced the  largest investment of its kind in U.S. history, and will  invest  billions in Georgia to create a complete solar supply chain in  the  United States. Hanwha's stake in REC Silicon marks the re-birth of  U.S.  polysilicon.
6. Silicon   anodes for better batteries are materializing. It has been the talk  the  last couple of years, but finally, it is happening. It is safe to  say  that this creates an even more solid foundation for the company. As  the  former CEO once said ***They (the battery makers) have to come to us, or go to China.***   And to directly reference their website; REC Silicon‚Äôs silane is the   material of choice for lithium-ion batteries - and REC is a global   leader in silane-based materials.

**EV/Batteries**

With  REC Silicon holding this highly strategic position in the supply chain,   prominent players are setting up shop in Moses Lake, Washington. In  fact, right next door, and are becoming neighbours (See image posted   below).

There is not a whole lot   official information from the company about this situation, yet. We   believe it is just a matter of time before more information are made   available and public. Below is a curated list of what we know this far.

* October 2020 - Group14 &amp; REC Silicon announced they are teaming up to meet demand for the ""Electrification of Everything"" ([https://group14.technology/en/news/group14-rec-silicon-plan-us-factory-to-meet-demand-for-the-electrification-of-everything](https://group14.technology/en/news/group14-rec-silicon-plan-us-factory-to-meet-demand-for-the-electrification-of-everything)).
* December   2022 - Group14 submits an application for the construction of a  factory in Moses Lake. They mean business and are coming to town (See  image  posted below). In addition to this, they closes another funding  round, representing one of top 10 largest climate tech raises in 2022.

**Solar**

REC   Silicon's solar grade polysilicon is used in the manufacturing of  solar  ingots and wafers. Wafers are made into solar cells, and then  solar  panels. By using Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR) technology, using  one-tenth  of the electricity needed for Siemens technology, affords  low-cost  material and ultra-low carbon footprint, making its solar  module value  chain more sustainable. FBR is the patented technology of  the company,  and makes it possible produce solar-grade polysilicon in a  continuous,  rather than a batch, process. This makes REC Silicon one  of the most  efficient producers of solar-grade silicon in the world,  and their  product is some of the least expensive silicon available for  solar  panels.

Using  hydropower-based  clean energy, REC Silicon produces low-carbon  polysilicon without  emitting greenhouse gases. Compared to carbon-heavy  polysilicon  manufactured overseas that often relies on coal power, REC  Silicon's  ‚Äúclean polysilicon‚Äù is expected to draw more demand in the  coming years  as international scrutiny over industrial emissions and  carbon  footprints grows.

A quick  recap.  REC Silicon's biggest plant shut down in 2019. Without access to  Chinese  market, their lifeline got cut off. There was no solar module  value  chain outside of China. Now, almost four years later, things are  looking  brighter. Solar module value chains are forming in both the  U.S. and  Europe. REC Silicon is teaming up with Hanwha Q CELLS, for  delivery of  solar grade polysilicon. As of this writing, they have  ongoing  negotiations with Hanwha Solutions towards reaching an offtake  agreement  for all FBR polysilicon production ([https://recsilicon.com/news-article/?slug=rec-silicon-update-of-restart-and-offtake-activities-in-moses-lake](https://recsilicon.com/news-article/?slug=rec-silicon-update-of-restart-and-offtake-activities-in-moses-lake)).   With Hanwha Q CELLS being one of the most trusted names, and ambitious   companies in the solar industry, this is of course promising.

Ever   since Hanwha became the largest shareholder, they have been promoting   REC Silicon as a vital part of their bigger plan. The importance of  this  newborn partnership is certainly no secret to Hanwha, and this is   highlighted by the statements below.

&gt;*This   year, Hanwha also acquired REC Silicon, a crucial step along the   company‚Äôs path to building out a full solar value chain, and expanded   its plans for its green energy businesses in the U.S. thanks to the   incentives in the groundbreaking Inflation Reduction Act.*([https://www.hanwha.com/en/news\_and\_media/stories/sustainability/hanwhas-year-in-review-2022.html).-----](https://www.hanwha.com/en/news_and_media/stories/sustainability/hanwhas-year-in-review-2022.html).-----)*By   investing in REC Silicon, with US plants that produce special gas for   semiconductor as well as polysilicon, we are expanding our business  into  high value‚Äìadded core industrial materials.* ([https://www.hanwha.com/en/products\_and\_services/chemicals-materials.html).-----](https://www.hanwha.com/en/products_and_services/chemicals-materials.html).-----)*By   becoming the largest shareholder of REC Silicon, Hanwha will expand  its  renewable energy portfolio in the U.S. and help American businesses   secure raw material critical to the solar supply chain. As global   competition over clean energy sources intensifies in the coming years,   Hanwha will work towards establishing a highly efficient, low-carbon   system to boost clean energy technology.*\-----*Hanwha   Solutions‚Äô strategic investment in REC Silicon represents a step   towards establishing a highly efficient, low carbon solar value chain in   the US and to ensure that REC Silicon plays an integral role in these   efforts. Hanwha Solutions‚Äô knowledge, expertise, and capabilities are   expected to enhance REC Silicon‚Äôs ability to take advantage of   opportunities and developing markets in the solar, semiconductor, and   battery industries.* ([https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/11/18/2336964/0/en/REC-Silicon-ASA-Strategic-equity-investment-by-Hanwha-Solutions.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/11/18/2336964/0/en/REC-Silicon-ASA-Strategic-equity-investment-by-Hanwha-Solutions.html)).

Lets end this solar section with a statement from Joe Biden, on the Hanwha Q CELLS investment decision ([https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/11/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-hanwha-q-cells-announcement/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/11/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-hanwha-q-cells-announcement/)).

**Semiconductors**

REC   Silicon\`s electronic grade certified polysilicon businesses provide a   variety of form factors for uses in high-tech energy and electronics   industries. From motor control and power conversion processes for hybrid   and electric vehicles, wind energy, and high voltage transmission, 5G   communications, high-speed trains, IoT (internet of things), and big   data to manufacturing of 12‚Äô semiconductor wafers used in memory   processors, optics, and micro electromechanical systems (MEMS).

The   Chips and Science got signed into law. Spurred by the passage of this   bill we are expecting to see a huge boost in the American semiconductor   industry. REC Silicon's facility in Butte, MT, has been recognized by   the White House as a potential candidate for domestic expansion of  silane gas production ([https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/](https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/)).

While   the company is not set to benefit directly from this specific Chips  and  Science act (unlike the IRA),  this will nevertheless create  conditions  that are intended to boost demand for REC's electronic-grade  silicon.  The Chips and Science Act is intended to expand domestic  production of  semiconductor chips, which are made out of  electronic-grade silicon that  the company produces at its facility in  Butte, Montana.

**Stock price and valuation**

Ticker   RECSI, Norwegian Stock Exchange. Included in the OBX index which holds   the 25 most liquid companies. Heavily traded and volatile. A  significant  number of retail investors owns this stock in Norway. They  have  recognized the seemingly limited downside, and huge upside. REC   Silicon\`s foundation is stronger then ever due to recent developments in   both the political and the industrial landscape. We are slowly   identifying larger investors taking place. But the stock will continue   to be volatile and manipulated by strong traders. We have never seen   treeshakes like this, and there is a great deal of psychology in play.   But we expect the float to change when contracts are signed, and we also   expect the stock to reprice significantly.

* As of this writing the stock price is NOK 14 (1.4 USD), which values the company at 586 mUSD
* Assuming 100% capacity we are looking at an annual EBITDA range of 200-400 mUSD by 2025.
* Moses Lake plant valued at 1.7 billion USD about to restart (valued at 0 in the company's accounts due to amortization)
* For   a business with strategic products for the U.S. solar industry and the   lithium-ion battery markets, and the know-how and experience to  consider  avenues for deeper expansion into these rapidly growing  industries, we  believe REC could have potential to command much higher  EBITDA multiples  then what the current market valuation implies at the  time of this  writing (&lt;3x EV/EBITDA)
* Under   the new IRA law, REC Silicon will be eligible for a $3-per-kilogram   refundable tax credit for every kilogram of solar-grade silicon the   company sells. This will have a favorable impact of $48 million per year   at full production.
* Potential to command a very large premium on selling silane gas to anode producers.
* REC   is uniquely positioned with two highly strategic assets in rapidly   expanding industries that should benefit from lasting political   tailwinds, strong profitability outlook and attractive funding   opportunities
* Needless   to say, there is upside potential for this stock. Recent investment   behaviour of several anode producers are clearly indicating that a blue   sky scenario is about to materialize for REC Silicon's. In this   scenario, Norwegian brokers have indicated a fair value of NOK 50-70   (5-7 USD).

**Potential short term triggers**

* Signed contract with Hanwha for delivery of solar-grade polysilicon
* Signed contracts with anode and battery producers
* Project Riser (More on this later)
* Yulin IPO China (REC Silicons's 15% valued at around 180 mUSD)
* Grant   from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the development of a   supply chain for next generation batteries (REC has been recognized by   the White House as a potential candidate for domestic expansion of   silane gas production). And REC has the past two years been a   participant in several meetings with the DOE for securing solar and   batteries in the U.S.

2975,wallstreetbets,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment‚Äôs price.¬†
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.¬†
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.¬†

2982,wallstreetbets,"Yesterday by the close, the Dow was up 1.09%, the Nasdaq up 1.67% and the S&amp;P up 1.46%.

The 10-year Treasury yield fell 0.876% to 3.509%, with a gap of -70 basis points over the two-year yield. The VIX fell 2.71%, Brent crude closed up 1.29%, and spot gold, which has been rising since Nov 22, closed up 0.26% yesterday at $1,928.18 an ounce. The dollar index continued to retreat from its highs to close at 102.09.

The IMF raised its forecast for global GDP growth in 2023 to 2.9% down from its previous estimate of 2.7% in October. Despite double-digit inflation and the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the euro zone is expected to avoid a recession after preliminary fourth-quarter GDP growth of 1.9%, the lowest since Q1 2021. This underlines the resilience of the eurozone economy after overcoming the risk of energy shortages, according to the institute's analysis. But with economists also expecting a fall in eurozone output in the first quarter, the eurozone is not out of the woods yet. Some headwinds, including higher borrowing costs, have yet to be fully felt and consumers in some member states will still face high energy bills. However, inflation is expected to slow sharply due to falling gas prices; The Labour market is also doing well. That means the ECB can continue to focus on tackling high and persistent inflation.

.

The labor cost index in the fourth quarter of the United States recorded a quarterly rate of 1%, slightly below market expectations, has fallen for three consecutive quarters, the pressure of the wage and price spiral in the United States further eased, hit the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2021. While wage growth is coming down, it remains relatively high. In historical terms, 1% is still too high. Before the pandemic, the figure was usually below 1%. Fitch expects a mild U.S. recession, with growth slowing to 0.2% in 2023.

3015,wallstreetbets,"See many people attack Michael Burry for being wrong. I want to explain why he may not be wrong:

When many people like Burry do their research and predict ""doom"" events, they may or may not get the timing right. Most don't and this is why economists are often the butt of jokes.

The problems these guys called out have always existed.  Housing bubble. Dot-com bubble. Inflation. Even before these guys predicted it, the problems have always existed. Like a burning house, market just doesn't care until it explodes into flames. 

You can compare the current market to a house filled with gasoline. The problems have always existed but until there's a major catalyst, the fire(like powell), most won't recognize it exists..

So the price will never reflect the disaster until 1) theres a major catalyst triggering the fire and 2) most market participants recognize that there is a fire. 

Point 2 is important because you can always buy a stock 100x it's fundamental (tesla) or coins with no earnings or fundamental values ( bitcorns) and can still make money from other people paying for it.

but at some point, liquidity run dry and liquidation start cascading from over speculation like dominos.

 Madoff ran a ponzi for more than decade until the fire start in 2008. An analyst did call him out early and got ignored as well. So timing is tough but guys like Burry are much starter and well informed than the regular wsb idiot so don't start hating the guy because you have a bag.","""He called 10 out of the past 2 recessions so he must be wrong"".

3037,wallstreetbets,"Once upon a time, Jerome Powell was the chair of the Federal Reserve, tasked with managing the country's monetary policy. On a fateful day, he announced that he would be raising interest rates by a shocking 200 basis points, causing widespread panic among investors and sending stocks tumbling.

As the market crashed, traders and economists alike struggled to understand why Powell would make such a drastic move. Some speculated that the economy was overheating and that the Fed was trying to cool it down, while others thought that perhaps Powell had insider information that the market was about to tank.

But as the dust began to settle, Powell made a shocking revelation: he was secretly a bear, and had been manipulating the market as part of a larger plan to take over human civilization. Using his position of power, he had been able to control the economy and steer it towards his goals.

Despite the widespread outrage and calls for Powell's arrest, he managed to evade punishment and continued to rule over the economy with an iron paw. Under his leadership, bears gradually took over key positions of power and influence, gradually pushing humans out of the decision-making process.

As the years passed, human society became more and more bear-dominated, until they eventually became the dominant species on the planet. People lived in fear of the bears and their wrath, with the economy and markets completely controlled by their furry overlords.
The once-great human civilization was now ruled by the bears, with Powell at the head of it all. Despite the devastation he had wrought, he remained in power, a symbol of the bears' domination and the humans' defeat.",I asked an AI to write a story about what JPow is going to do tomorrow.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.82 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 58% and 79%. (Stats as of 2022-12-31)",2023-02-01 Wrinkle-brain Plays (Mathematically derived options plays),1675229918

3065,wallstreetbets,"Dear reader,

My name is Manzeel Ahmed, for two years I have been working on a framework which I uploaded on [Change.org](https://Change.org) that includes a clause for banning short selling and payment for order flow. I also included a clause to mandate the publication of all political donations (to prevent and fight the corruption that got us in this mess in the first place).

&amp;#x200B;

I was sick and tired of politicians deliberately (on purpose) ignore the common sense everyday basic issues that everyone faces and is relevant for everyone regardless of demographics. 

&amp;#x200B;

What was the last straw and the trigger for me was the January 6th riot.

&amp;#x200B;

Why should we vote (no, no, no)?

Well, first of all, the hedgies, regulators (who are with them), and the DTCC don't play the rules.

We are not only cutting those bastards loan of the number of shares by 90 percent (the massive loan of shares is the whole point of why AMC and APE is a short squeeze setup) we are also electronically giving away our shares to them which they can use to cover (they always cheat).

We also lose 90 percent of our shares, and most brokers have a limit on how high of a limit sell order we can set (even assuming that nobody cheats but then there would be no question of a squeeze).

&amp;#x200B;

Why is this important?

Stocks are traded on an ask/bid basis/process so the limit orders make up the ask/bid without which stocks cannot be bought or sold (it is because someone is setting a limit order that market sell orders work or otherwise nothing would get traded!).

Also, my suggestion is to use Computershare where they allow up to $3500 per share for a limit order.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I can't stress this enough, please DRS as it is key to selling the shares at a high price or running up the price sky high!

&amp;#x200B;

So, good luck multiplying your limit orders by 10 with the brokers with the reverse split (sarcasm and at the same time very serious (as in, come on, you can't be that stupid!)).

&amp;#x200B;

I hold 3426 APE shares myself in Computershare. For DRSing open your account in Computershare (after successfully transferring your stocks/assets (contact your broker)) with your social security number and answer the security questions or you'll have to wait a week to get a letter to access your account. After that enter your bank information and after two weeks, they'll let you use that information for your limit sell (don't market sell!) orders or you can set your order without using your bank information and if it executes, you'll have a check mailed to you.

&amp;#x200B;

It is an honor to be in your guy's presence and I am humbled to even be allowed to speak to you guys.

&amp;#x200B;

If we can drive the prices of illegally shorted stocks up, well, we can also unify around a framework that will ensure that short selling and payment for order flow is banned forever.

3227,wallstreetbets," ‚ÄúMargin of Safety: Risk-Averse Value Investing Strategies for the Thoughtful Investor‚Äù by Seth Klarman is known for its high **price tag of $2,500**. Here are my top 10 takeaways from the book ‚ÄúMargin of Safety‚Äù by Seth Klarman:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Strive for a margin of safety**: When investing, always aim to purchase assets at a significant discount to their intrinsic value to protect against potential downside risk. This is especially critical in volatile or uncertain market conditions.
2. **Understand intrinsic value:** Know the true value of an investment, rather than relying on market prices or trends, to make informed decisions and avoid overpaying. By understanding intrinsic value, you can make better-informed decisions and avoid overpaying for an investment.
3. **Be a contrarian:** Seek out undervalued assets that the market may be overlooking, to find hidden gems with substantial growth potential.
4. **Mind the market psychology**: Understand how emotions and perceptions can influence market trends, so you can better anticipate market movements and make informed decisions.
5. **Be ready to act:** Don‚Äôt miss out on potential investments due to hesitation or procrastination. Be prepared to act when opportunities arise. By being ready to act, you can capitalize on market opportunities and achieve superior returns.
6. **Practice discipline:** True value investors must be unemotional and willing to hold onto their investments for the long term, even when others are panicking.
7. **Conduct due diligence:** Analyze the financial and qualitative aspects of a business, such as its management, competitive position, and industry trends, before making any investment decisions.
8. **Maintain a long-term perspective:** Focus on building wealth over time, rather than trying to make quick profits or time the market.
9. **Be patient:** Avoid hasty decisions and remain patient, even during short-term market fluctuations. This will help you avoid costly mistakes.
10. **Avoid speculation:** Steer clear of high-risk investments and focus on finding undervalued assets with a margin of safety for better returns in the long term.",10 lessons from the investing book ‚ÄúMargin of Safety‚Äù by Seth Klarman:,1675209252

3254,wallstreetbets,"Looking at the data for the past 10 years for Natural Gas, there is a seasonal pattern where Natural Gas prices rebound, hence, the saying 'Buy in Feb, Sell in May' or even later principle as seen in 2022.

Let's look at this pattern. Here are the years with the dates when the price of Natural Gas rose, by **A LOT**

**2013** - Yes, Price of NG rose on 2/11/13
**2014** - Yes, Price of NG rose on 2/3/14
2015 - No
**2016** - Yes, Price of NG rose on 2/29/16
**2017** - Yes, Price of NG rose on 2/20/17
**2018** - Yes, Price of NG rose on 2/5/18
2019 - No
2020 - No - shutdowns, so doesn't count
**2021** - Yes, Price of NG rose on 1/25/21
**2022** - Yes, Price of NG rose on 2/7/22

This is a 70 to 30 percent win-loss ratio in favor of Natural gas, which is technically 80 to 20 percent win-loss ratio since the 2020 shutdowns were a one off event.

Looking back even further out 20-25 years, the percentages and odds show Natural Gas is due for a repeated pattern and repeated rise.

Natural Gas is in way oversold territory and if you look at the downtrend, the **Rate of the downtrend** is slowing. The rate of declines are getting less and less, Natural Gas is ticking and mean reversion is soon to happen with prices reverting up

**Catalysts** coming: Freeport LNG up and running 100% in March or likely even February, and just one tiny winter storm will set off Natural Gas prices. This warm weather in the US and EU is an anomaly and not enough to stop seasonality.

Further Reasons for Natural Gas to go up in February and all through Summer:

-**Freeport LNG** open by March. Watch out shorts
-Technicals way oversold (Zero chance as some claim on reddit and youtube comments of Natural Gas touching $1.44 lows in 2008, that was a recession started by housing, people are using Natural Gas every day now in the US)
-Elliot Wave Theory shows the pullback is almost done and oversold indicators show ready for a bounce, Price will find a bottom soon
-China reopening will lead to more global demand on Natural Gas
-Weaker US dollar means higher prices for Commodities
-California Natural Gas Shortage
-Production Freeze Offs in Texas and Southern States
-Short covering
-FOMC will show FED has no idea what they're doing bringing inflation down and stagflation will set in 
-Hedge Funds and Algos are in seasonal pattern, see the buying today, wait and see the next few weeks
-Some comments in past threads claim of a 'low use season' which just leads to Natural Gas companies cutting production costs and Natural Gas output. There is article with a Natural Gas CEO considering this. Once a cold winter strikes in EU when this happen, these are headwinds and tailwinds for Natural Gas prices
-Natural Gas price can't go down in a straight line to $1.44 and lower
-Deglobalization
-EU's need for Natural Gas in Fall months

**What to expect in the next few days**, chop, and eventual major upswing. Natural Gas Prices might be down the past few weeks, but just wait and see, be patient, Natural Gas is gonna be a multibagger wealth builder the next few months",Natural Gas Prices will meteorically rise due to Seasonality.

Long Google person here giving you one last opportunity to get on this train before it pulls out of the station, which is happening on Thursday when reporting earnings. The only information you really need is that big money (Dodge &amp; Cox, Fidelity, etc.) have recently increased positions. But if you need more than that, there have been some revenue-generating changes the company has made which even the invertebrates among you will have noticed.

First, Youtube now makes you sit through two advertisements before watching a video. This was new in mid 2022, and there was some complaining right after it happened, but now we all blindly accept it, continuing to watch Call me Maybe on repeat. We have hundreds of millions of mouth breathers, simultaneously, staring into their computers right now watching endless loops of horrid music, self-help, ""my year building a log cabin,"" ""the REAL reason we dont see Bam Margera anymore,"" and other assorted drivel. Every single time they watch something to try to delay their lives they are getting 2 ads. Youtube revenue for the quarter will be higher YOY 10%.

You may have also noticed, for those of you using Chrome, that Google is assembling all of your passwords; to your fidelity account, your facebook and your grinder. This is going to be used to act as a new way to log in to your computer, meshing Chrome into your every action. Further, G Suite started charging a subscription fee starting in May 2022.

Regarding the DOJ investigating and bringing charges against Google for its domination of online advertising, that will not change what the earnings were, and since when does being investigated or even charged by the DOJ mean anything? Epstein was investigated and charged by DOJ before getting a high school hall pass from Alex Acosta, DOJ went after Augusta National, DOJ said the Sprint T-Mobile merger shouldn't happen because consumers would get hurt, but none of it amounted to diddly. They might have to pay a fine after Googles lawyers bog this down for a year or more, but rest assured it will be back to business as usual, soaking up our collective attention like a giant tampon. 

The only bad news is. Nancy dropped her shares. I dont know for sure why she would give up her precious tendies, but she maybe had to come up with some cash quickly to buy her husband a new head. 

The company shows earnings per share of $5, PE of 20, and is trading at a historically cheap price.

3291,wallstreetbets,"The day before FOMC generally speaking is a choppy range filled day. However today was probably one of the cleanest (yet slow/ small) straight bull trend days I have seen in a long time. 

However, even more impressive than that is the fact that we had a nearly $2.75 pump during the last 30 minutes of trading. The total range of the day was $5.76 that means 50% of the total days range happened during the last 30 minutes of trading. 

I generally like to swing calls into FOMC and when we touched 403.8 support during power hour almost opened calls but decided not to as I usually wait till after 4pm to open‚Ä¶ today is one of those days that we should opened and then closed EOD. I decided to sit cash. There are a lot of bullish technical for tomorrow and the data for FOMC but I don‚Äôt trust it.

Remember its not really the 25bps hike or not that is gonna matter tomorrow‚Ä¶ what is going to matter is whether or not JPOW says there are going to be further rate hikes and if/ when he says there is a chance for a pause. 

My thoughts are we rally into FOMC and then we will see 2pm spike on the 25bps news‚Ä¶ and most likely hold flat/ sell off into 230. If JPOW tells us about how we are going to see more 25bps and that there is no pause in sight this is going to get very very bloody. Tomorrow is going to be an extremely volatile day.

Taking a look at the rising wedge here on SPY you can see that we are holding the blue rising wedge and with that incredible EOD push we broke through 405.3 resistance and are now back over that resistance level.

Not only that we came down and held the daily 8ema support and bounced off of that today too. 

The blue rising wedge gives room for a run to as high as 411.2 tomorrow to hold that resistance line. However, that resistance line could easily be broken if the algos hard pump us tomorrow. 

Key SPY Support- 405.3 -&gt; 402.8 -&gt; 400.7

Key SPY Resistance- 410.3 -&gt; 413.8

Futures looks incredibly bullish today too. We had a very nice wick off the daily 200ema and presumably we will see the 20ema crossover the 200ema tomorrow too. With the 4040 support/ daily 8ema bounce we are closing right at key resistance of 4085. From here the next key level is 4095 that bulls need to take out. If they take out that there is a lot of upside potential. 

4155 is that blue bull channel resistance. 

KEY Futures support- 4085 -&gt; 4075 -&gt; 4055 -&gt; 4040 -&gt; 4030

Tesla actually is looking fairly bearish. We did have a nice support bounce off 162.4 support this morning, however Tesla was not able to get back through 173.4 resistance today. 

We have developed a blue bull channel and a black bull channel.

Blue bull support is 169 and resistance is 200. Black bull channel support is 151.4 and resistance is 189.6.

Two of the biggest levels to watch is 166.5 support and 185.2/ 197.2 resistance. 

I still fully expect a retrace back to the 150s to fill the gap on tesla within the next week or two. 

Key Tesla support- 166.4 -&gt; 162.4 -&gt; 159.7 -&gt; 154.1

Somewhat surprising here is that the VIX broke through that blue resistance line that dated back to October today but almost instantly after breaking through it retraced and closed under 19.7 yet again. With FOMC being tomorrow I would have suspected some rise in the VIX. 

With this bearish engulfing VIX daily candle we should expect a bullish day tomorrow. 

With FOMC tomorrow the day is going to be extremely volatile especially after 2pm. Everything relies on exactly what JPOW says tomorrow at 230pm.

Overall swang those 24dte tesla puts and closed them nearly at the bottom this morning. I did end up re-entering those EOD today too. 

I was still under the weather a little today so I didn‚Äôt trade much and frankly SPY seemed moments away from absolutely massive selloff all day. 

Despite the crazy obvious bull trend none of it looked strong. There are 252 trading days in a year‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt have to trade every single day. And even if we do trade those days its okay to trade lightly some days. 

Premiums were very expensive today cause of FOMC so I spent quite few hours in a call waiting for any sort of return on it too. I look forward to FOMC being over and no big news until CPI on the 14th.",Pre-FOMC day‚Ä¶ 1-31-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,1675201099

3325,wallstreetbets,"Nasdaq Futures this tightening cycle:

   


We certainly won‚Äôt be surprised by 25bps. Funds futures are pricing in a near certainty of 25bps tomorrow. Powell has historically telegraphed any surprises far in advance, with the exception of 75 bps last June following a hot CPI read during the Fed Blackout Period. Even then he leaked it to the WSJ so markets knew what to expect.

We also are very unlikely to learn anything new about another 25bps in March. Futures have odds around 80%. Fed minutes and pressers have continually expressed need for ‚Äúoptionality.‚Äù

We won‚Äôt get a dot plot (every other meeting) so won‚Äôt get revised forecasts for the terminal rate.

From my perspective, Equity and Bond markets don‚Äôt believe the Fed won‚Äôt start decreasing rates again later this year despite minutes from last meeting stating no member saw it appropriate to decrease until 2024. Even Vice Chair Brainard, pretty dovish, recently stated, ‚ÄúThe FOMC moved policy into restrictive territory at a rapid pace and subsequently downshifted the pace of increases in the target range at its most recent meeting‚Ä¶. Even with the recent moderation, inflation remains high, and policy will need to be sufficiently restrictive for some time to make sure inflation returns to 2 percent on a sustained basis.‚Äù

Brainard also alluded to fact that core-PCE is about 2/3rds housing costs (largely owners equivalent of rent) and recent prints have actually increased despite a housing slowdown. She knows that rents are starting to decline but this won‚Äôt be reflected in CPI or PCE until ‚Äúthe third quarter of this year.‚Äù [Speech by Vice Chair Brainard on the economic outlook - Federal Reserve Board ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20230119a.htm)She‚Äôs obviously aware of publications by Summers but references an internal Fed study instead.

It seems completely implausible to me that Powell will say anything (advertently) to signal a more dovish ‚Äúpivot‚Äù while simultaneously announcing a rate increase and at a minimum downplaying some expectations it will be the last of the cycle.

Rather, the Fed appears in a game of chicken of mouse with the Market and knows the market is ahead of where it wants to be to retain ‚Äúoptionality‚Äù as new (lagging) data comes in. Powell will sound as hawkish as possible in my opinion and I would be surprised if he doesn‚Äôt feign a sadistic drive for more ‚Äúpain.‚Äù

The market, for its part, knows the Fed is in a touch position of how it communicates and really has no choice but to be as hawkish as possible given current expectations. CTA algos might freak out momentarily if Powell goes full sadist but also a lot of hedges in form of Equity and Bond Futures and Options to unwind and we won‚Äôt really get a sense of market reaction until OpEx on Friday.

All this is to ask‚Äîwhat exactly are people jittery about that they are waiting this one out? I‚Äôm far from a Fed watcher so please let me know if I‚Äôm missing something in my very rough analysis.",Those waiting on the sidelines for Fed: what exactly are you hoping to learn?,1675197540

Dataroma doesn't yield anything crazy buy or sell, a few people inside the company unloaded around 30ish mil last earnings, but only activity this month is 67k, so not a substantial indicator for bad earnings. Could mean that they expect to beat earnings, or at least not see much movement after.

Anyway, the prevailing bias in the treasury market since the GFC has been as you'd expect... unlimited QE, money printing, and ZIRP. Culminating into a treasury market that consists of a bunch of lobotomized regards that think the feds main responsibility is to pump asset markets. This was only reinforced in 2018 when paper shake Powell got bullied by Donny T into feeding the addicted regards what they want most, cuts. Even today, these same regards will use this scenario as proof that Powell will back down.

However, inflation has changed the playing field. The U.S. Dollar is one of the primary load bearing pillars of power for America and if that is lost the whole house comes toppling down. I'll spare you the lecture on inflation but it is literally an empire killer that shakes the foundations of a country from the inside and out.

Lets not forget, Powell literally lived and worked through the 1970s and saw first hand the de-stabilizing effect inflation had on growth. And subsequently the decisive and powerful kick in the d\*ck that Volcker gave to the economy to rout inflation and sow the seeds for one of the largest bull markets of the era. Furthermore, Powell has even brought up Volckers ability to remain vigilant in the face of backlash that caused many of his predecessors like Arthur Burns to relent restarting the inflation spiral.

Back to the present, Powell has shown his ability to be flexible and decisive in raising rates up to this point. But lets not forget that real rates are still supremely negative. All these idiots talking about 4.5% yield when inflation is hanging around 6% on the conservative end. To quote the GOAT Stanley Druckenmiller: ""Once inflation goes above 5%, it has never come back down without the Fed Funds Rate exceeding CPI"". The situation is still bleak at best in terms of the inflation fight.

However, the prevailing bias I have mentioned still hasn't changed from the unlimited QE lobotomites who have brought us to where we are now. Where a couple inflation prints that show a .2 reduction in a 6 handle inflation as a reason to front run QE, rate cuts, and ZIRP lala land. Giving way to considerable easing in financial conditions. This is what has created the ridiculous mispricing of the treasury market.

Powell has hypothesised out a terminal rate of around 5% for rates. At peak hawkishness on interest rates, the 20 year treasury was yielding 4.5% back in October/November. But, since the slightest reduction in the rate of inflation the yield has since dropped to 3.7% on the 20 year. Essentially slapping Powell in the face. This is where the opportunity lies, Powell will have to whip his sausage out and slap the market with it to continue the fight at some point.

My instrument of choice in the interest rate campaign has been TLT , the 20yr and longer treasury ETF, I have made some great gains in 2022 from shorting this ETF. But since the considerable easing, IV on TLT has reached a near low of \~16. Culminating in a severely underpriced scenario for us regards to enjoy.

**Positions/conclusion:**

Admittedly, I made some tactical errors in positioning for this hypothesis as I discounted just how regarded the bond market is being in trying to get back to sweet sweet ZIRP and have taken paper casualties. Moreover, I got greedy and impatient in opening some of my positions strikes and durations. As well as not closing some gains when interest rates rose in early January, but tis the tide of war.

However, the thesis remains strong, shooting for around a 4-4.5%(around 90-95 TLT pricing) terminal rate for longer term treasuries there is ample opportunity for profit off of this market. I would recommend sacrificing some exponential gain opportunity for duration in option contracts. (Time and Patience are the greatest warriors of all) This is also of minor issue because IV is so cheap as of now on TLT.

Two small but critically important pieces of news in the past few weeks are early indicators that the global economic order, centred on the primacy of the dollar, is slowly coming apart ‚Äì bringing the threat of radically worsened instability.

First, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs finance minister said the Gulf kingdom had ‚Äúno objection‚Äù to selling its oil in a currency other than dollars. Saudi has made similar noises before, but this latest suggestion comes after Chinese president Xi Jinping urged Gulf countries to take up the yuan for the settlement of oil and gas trades with China at the first China-Arab States Summit, hosted with great pomp and ceremony by Saudi‚Äôs Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Riyadh last month.

As the world‚Äôs largest crude oil exporter, and (until recently) a lynchpin of US strategy in the Middle East, any such moves by Saudi Arabia would be big news. It would mean the world‚Äôs first and second largest oil exporters ‚Äì Saudi and Russia ‚Äì would no longer be looking to trade that oil solely in dollars.

In recent years, Saudi has been developing increasingly close ties with China, the world‚Äôs largest oil importer. The December summit saw both sides repeat their ‚Äúfirm support‚Äù for each other and sign a series of deals on trade and technology. These included a memorandum of understanding with Chinese tech giant Huawei on supplying cloud computing and high-tech infrastructure for Saudi cities, in defiance of US bans. A new ‚Äòpetroyuan‚Äô would cement this rupture in the international system.

On the other side of the world, there was the announcement by Brazil and Argentina that they, too, would be looking to use a new currency for bilateral trade ‚Äì this time establishing an entirely new money, potentially to be called the ‚Äòsur‚Äô. There have been moves to create joint Brazil-Argentine currencies before, but they have tended to flounder on political grounds, with strong opposition from both countries‚Äô central banks.

Now, with left-leaning and independent-minded governments in both countries, there is a greater willingness to try and establish a new currency, separated from the dollar system. Early reports indicate that it is planned to be a foreign-trade only instrument, used in settling payments for cross-border trades rather than something you‚Äôd take to the shops. Both countries recognise the complications involved, but with other South American countries invited to join it could, over time, start to function as an alternative to the dollar.

Put these two items together and they feed into a general pattern where major economies are starting to back out of the dollar-dominated global system. Since the end of the Cold War, we have all lived in a world where the US economy, and with it the dollar, are overwhelmingly important.",Are we seeing the collapse of the dollar-dominated global economy?,1675190039

If the BEARS are DEAD, we going down.   
If the BULLS got a Raging Hard on, we going down.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been on the Street \[since\] 1980 \[and\] not one bear market has ever traded above nine times to 14 times the previous peak earnings,‚Äù the Chanos &amp; Co. founder told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúFast Money‚Äù on Monday.

His latest warning comes in the midst of earnings season, two days before the Federal Reserve decision on interest rates and four days before the key January employment report. According to Chanos, the market will not be able to overcome rising rates and falling corporate profitability.

‚ÄúThings are not cheap,‚Äù said Chanos, who acknowledges stocks are still cheaper than 18 months ago. ‚ÄúBut people are pricing in a pretty nice Goldilocks¬†scenario.‚Äù

So far this year, the S&amp;P 500 is up almost 5%, with media, technology and airlines leading the gains. On Tuesday, the index fell 1.3% to close at 4,017.77.

Chanos notes the market is anticipating corporate profits rising 12% this year, 2% inflation and a Fed rate cut within the next six to seven months.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs pretty much nirvana if you‚Äôre a bull,‚Äù he said.

Chanos, who said he doesn‚Äôt try to time the market, doubts the bullish scenario will unfold.

‚ÄúIf you think earnings are peaking now at $200, that‚Äôs a long way down,‚Äù Chanos said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs 1,800 to 2,800 \[on the S&amp;P 500\]. We are not anywhere near that.‚Äù

New AMD chips are slower than Intel's 13th gen Raptor Lake equivalent.  New IHS design creates excessive heat. Heat pipe issues with latest  GPU's resulting in replacements for customers on AMD's dime will negatively impact 1st quarter 2023 results.  When comparing sales of the latest CPU's, AMD is getting hammered by Intel.   


The only bright spots for AMD are sales of Tesla's are through the roof and they use AMD chips in their display, though the profit margin is minimal with these, and the new motherboards for the AM5 platform will push up motherboard chipsets sales.

The IMF raised its growth forecast to 2.9% from 2.7%, citing resilient growth in Q3 with strong labor and consumption, and better than expected adaptation to Europe's energy crisis. The euro zone posted unexpected growth in Q4, easing fears of a recession. However, inflation and Russia's war in Ukraine remain threats to the economy. GM exceeded earnings expectations with $2.12 per share and $43.11 billion in revenue, indicating a normalization in the auto sector after supply chain disruptions from the Covid pandemic. Tightening margins remain an industry-wide issue. The Biden administration will end the Covid national health emergency in May, treating it as a seasonal health risk like the flu.

Overall Market Outlook: 

**SPY**: Bearish candle close on the daily TF. We have a head&amp;shoulders pattern and we are in a big rising wedge and squeezing on the hourly TF. We are getting awfully close to having the golden cross happen but hopefully FOMC tanks us and we see more blood! I'm still very bearish on the overall market until certain levels are reclaimed, along with more indicator confirmations and we see better fundamentals. Expected Move +/- $3.43

**QQQ**: Bearish candle close on the daily TF. We sold off and closed back below the 200MA on the daily. And we are still inside an ascending channel on the hourly TF. Get ready to catch the big release make sure to keep your eyes on it! It will most likely happen for FOMC or the day after and when you see the release and the trend has been set 9/10 times its a hold all day type move! Expected Move +/- $3.26

Watchlist:

**TSLA**: Dark Cloud Cover candle pattern close on the daily TF. And we have a tweezer top on the daily as well. And we closed in big demand zone this could be the start of are handle now! Take 180c or 190c Calls above 170.67 or the 150p or 145p Puts below 160.50. Expected Move +/- $13.15

**NVDA**: Bearish Marabuzo candle close on the daily TF. We finally brokeout the ascending channel we been in! And we closed right above big demand zone. Take 200c or 205c Calls above 194.20. Expected Move +/- $11.97

**BMY** - Bristol Myers is coming down to test support around $71.60, this level is where the stock found support back in early January. Also, momentum is pointing to the downside as the stock trades under all crucial daily moving averages. If this level breaks I believe we get a move down to the lows of August around $65.

**LNG** - LNG stock is hurt massively by a drop in natural gas prices which is down over 70% from the highs and is now below pre Ukraine war levels. The stock closed below major support around $149 yesterday which could cause a larger move lower for this stock which is also currently showing bearish momentum as it trades under all daily moving averages.",Morning Briefing üåû Jan 31st 2022 - Let's see if we're right again,1675175096

3591,wallstreetbets,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment‚Äôs price.¬†
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.¬†
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.¬†

The chair, Jerome Powell, was nestled in bed, While visions of growth danced in his head. And the economists in their suits, and the bankers so bright, Were hashing out numbers till late into the night. 

When out on the street there arose such a clatter, Powell sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window he flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters, and threw up the sash. 

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow, Gave a luster of midday to objects below. When, what to Powell's wondering eyes should appear, But a group of stock traders, full of optimism, and cheer.

They cheered and they shouted and called out his name, Excited for the rate hike, and the market's gain. Powell smiled and went down, to join in on the fun, And spoke of the future, and the economy to come.

""The rate hike,"" he said, ""is a sign of progress, A step towards growth, and financial success. So have no fear, my dear friends, and rest easy tonight, For the future looks bright, and everything's just right.""

And with a nod, he said goodnight, and retired to bed, His mission complete, the future inspired ahead. The stock traders dispersed, with a smile on their faces, And Powell lay back down, with visions of growth and graces.",'Twas the night before the rate hike!,1675165419

The outcome of both will likely play a big role in determining whether or not this decline turns into a more sustained sell-off. However, the S&amp;P500 currently looks like it could be in for another rejection from the key 4100 level. If disappointing earnings and a relatively hawkish Fed does trigger further selling, it will be interesting to see if SPX can hold support around its former downtrend resistance and 200-day MA.

Check out LASE. It‚Äôs under $5 but has big upside and momentum behind it. As a fellow user pointed out many market sessions ago, laser tech will be a bigger thing in the future. This company (LASE) is a part of that bigger thing.

Industrial equipment, ships, vehicles, construction equipment all eventually need to get cleaned, just like our hallowed local Wendy‚Äôs dumpsters. Usually using power washers and powerful solvents the vile build up of gunk and crap gets yeeted off of the surfaces. These laser people though, guess how they remove filth. That‚Äôs right, with 0DTE SPY calls in bear markets. JK lol, with lasers. They even develop, and make their own lasers in house so they‚Äôre vertically integrated. They‚Äôre based out of Florida, so somebody make a Florida man joke.

They got a large order to clean a fleet of ships or something and they have had contracts with government accounts. It IPO‚Äôd last September and is now closing in on the all time high‚Äôs set back then. It‚Äôs consolidating, aka the paper hands are getting shaken out and the diamond hands are becoming the stable foundation for the next breakout. This looks ready to set ATH‚Äôs and break out when the highly elevated buying pressure over the past months takes out all the paper hands from the IPO. I‚Äôll be diamond handing higher. I already sold shares for 400% profits.

If you‚Äôre stupid don‚Äôt trade in the stonk market‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm stupid but I still trade though, so idk, just figure it out or whatever‚Ä¶ idc

3658,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: A significant decrease in OTM calls that have about a month or 2 till expiry indicates market makers/ whales are closing their covered calls because they are at high risk at printing. 

After watching thousands of my money evaporate buying FDs I started to think about the idea of selling covered calls. Then I realized that requires having a lot of money to buy snares so I got to thinking about - how do the market master regards know when to sell calls and when to buy them? 
There‚Äôs been a lot of focus on volume of options or short interest and found it‚Äôs not that reliable of an indicator. 
But what about a decreased in open interest?  Wouldn‚Äôt that indicate that the whale regards are closing a big covered call position bc they have all the tools/ data we don‚Äôt and know that it‚Äôs time to buy back their calls. 

I‚Äôve been watching this and found that it‚Äôs most reliable when :

1) The decrease in OI is higher than 80% of all entire OI. 
2) Strike price range is at least +10%  out of the money 
3)The expiry date is at least 2 weeks to a month away. 

So what good is this theory without a case study? 
I found an example [LVS decrease in OI OTM calls](https://imgur.com/a/R42vi9J)

I haven‚Äôt been tracking LVS and have no clue what‚Äôs about to happen but we can see that some major whale regard activity has been in play today. They‚Äôre buying back all these calls bc they‚Äôre about to print. 

RISK / HOW I COULD BE WRONG:

It‚Äôs possible that MM are closing these positions to open new ones (selling puts or more CCs that are further dated / more OTM? 

This is definitely a possibility to consider. Also I‚Äôm highly regarded so that‚Äôs something to consider as well. 

Let‚Äôs see if LVS goes for a run now that these calls have been ‚Äúbought to close.‚Äù

3663,wallstreetbets,"The United Nations released the ""World Economic Situation and Prospects to 2023"" report on the 25th. The report predicts that due to the confluence of multiple factors, the world economic growth rate in 2023 will drop from about 3% in 2022 to 1.9%.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the report, under the influence of the new crown epidemic, the Ukraine crisis, high inflation and climate change, the world economy will be hit hard in 2022, and the world economy will continue to be under pressure in 2023. The growth rate is expected to slow down to 1.9%, the highest growth rate in decades. One of the slowest years. If some macroeconomic headwinds can start to recede, world economic growth will pick up to 2.7% in 2024.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the report, the slowdown in world economic growth affects both developed countries and developing countries, and many countries face the risk of economic recession in 2023. In 2022, the growth momentum of developed economies such as the United States and the European Union will weaken significantly. In 2023, the economic growth of the United States and the European Union is expected to slow down to 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, Japan's is 1.5%, and the economies of the United Kingdom and Russia will shrink by 0.8% and 2.9%, respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

The report pointed out that the economic growth rate in East Asia is expected to reach 4.4% in 2023, mainly due to the improvement of China's economic situation. As the Chinese government optimizes epidemic prevention policies and adopts favorable economic measures, China's economic growth will accelerate in 2023.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the report, slowing global economic growth, rising inflation, and heightened debt vulnerabilities may further set back the hard-won achievements of the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, including the progress of poverty eradication. Governments should avoid austerity policies, which impede economic growth. The international community urgently needs to increase its efforts in providing financial assistance to developing countries and reducing debt burdens.

&amp;#x200B;

On the same day, Li Junhua, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations in charge of economic and social affairs, attended the report conference at the United Nations Headquarters in New York and pointed out that the current crisis is hitting the most vulnerable groups the hardest. The international community should strengthen cooperation and work together to avoid human suffering and support Create an inclusive and sustainable future for the benefit of all.",World Economic Situation and Outlook in 2023,1675139953

This report mentioned the following:

 

 That Welltower was trying to offload its distressing assets by deals with entities whose authenticity was in doubt. It recently transferred its distressed assets (senior nursing facilities) from a company called Promedica which was breaching bond covenants, to a joint venture with an entity called Integra healthcare. As Promedica was its largest operator at the time, this failing investment was a risk to the company and with the new joint venture with Integra, the stock gained 9% in a single day.

 

Hindenburg's research however alleges that Integra was registered only 6 months prior to this deal and its website was set up on the same day itself. While Welltower had claimed Integra was experienced in the skilled nursing field, Hindenburg alleges that the CEO was a 29 year old with no background in the field (who reportedly had been working at the 6month old company for the past 11 months) and the company had no employees on Linkedin.

 

He was also the CEO of a private equity firm called Perigrove which was allegedly not found at the Manhattan location where its address was purported to be and was found in the outskirts of New York with the building misspelling the name as Perigove.

 

They allege similar clearing of messy assets from their books in the past through another Integra CEO-affiliated firm.

 

Meanwhile Welltower has has been raising more money through dilution of equity and currently trades at a premium to its peers.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.82 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 58% and 79%. (Stats as of 2022-12-31)",2023-01-31 Wrinkle-brain Plays (Mathematically derived options plays),1675130640

&amp;#x200B;

(My Question): üì∑üì∑What is a stock?

&amp;#x200B;

(Chat GPT's response):

A stock, also known as a share or equity, represents a unit of ownership in a company. When a company goes public, it issues shares of stock to raise capital. As a shareholder, you own a portion of the company and have a claim (determined by the number of shares you own) on its assets and profits.

Stocks can be bought and sold on stock exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the NASDAQ, allowing investors to participate in the growth and success of the companies they invest in. The value of a stock is determined by supply and demand, and can fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including the company's financial performance, market conditions, and investor sentiment.

Owning stocks can provide potential for long-term growth and income, but also carries risks, as the value of stocks can decline as well as increase. It is important for individuals to thoroughly research and understand the risks involved before investing in stocks, and to consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice and guidance.",Booking up with chat GPT.,1675128688

So you wanna make a 6 bagger, here is how you do it.  

The way that The Black-Scholes model is composed leaves a lot of inequity in option prices especially with the introduction of 0DTE spy options.  Options pricing is completely out of whack 

when there are high IV events that occur.  Knowing this we can utilize the inequity of the options market to take advantage of pricing inequity. 

There are two big events happening this week.  On Wednesday we have FOMC, and on Thursday night we have three major companies reporting earnings(Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon).  The market is pricing these events unequally among the chain.  

u/lehmanparty, u/paxamericana2, u/vwaptendietamer, and u/skothr like to sit around and talk about this stuff every night.

If you look, the expected move between the Feb 3rd and the Feb 6th expiration is 60 cents.  You can play the inequity in the options chain by buying an ATM put calendar spread for the 3rd and the 6th.  Here‚Äôs an example for the possible return

You don‚Äôt even need to hold the trade till Friday at close. You can get rid of this after FOMC due to the theta decay and probably still make 100 or 200%.

We identify the most attractive stocks to overwrite for February expiration based on the screen (Exhibit 4). For 3-6 month overwrites, we highlight the top 50 opportunities based on our analysts‚Äô price targets as well as the top 50 put selling candidates based on our analysts‚Äô estimates.

* ***Call selling underperformed by 37bps while put selling outperformed by 50bps since Jan expiration.***We calculate the average return for a portfolio of 362 stocks in the US market that we believe are liquid (as identified by tight bid/ask spreads for 10% OTM calls). We observed that call selling outperformed a long stock strategy only in months with moderate to down stock performance, whereas put selling outperformed in most of the months except those with sharp market sell-offs. See Exhibit 2.
* ***Buy-write portfolio (call sale + long stock) is up 3.8% since Jan expiration.***We simulate owning stock and selling 10% OTM Feb calls as of Jan expiration. We track this portfolio through the month to see how single stock overwriting has performed. We estimate this portfolio is up 3.8% compared to the average stock performance of up 4.2%. See Exhibit 3.
* ***Put selling portfolio (put sale + long stock) is up 4.7% since Jan expiration.***We track this portfolio through the month to see how single stock put selling has performed. We estimate this portfolio is up 4.7% compared to the average stock performance of up 4.2%.

**We identify short-term overwriting opportunities (1 month) as well as longer-term overwriting opportunities (3-6 months) based on two primary methods-&gt;**

* ***Short-term overwrites (1 month): We focus on Events, Market Cap and implied volatility.***  
Our overwriting study shows that event timing and stock characteristics are particularly important factors for overwriting outperformance with short-term options. We identify stocks that do not report earnings prior to the next expiration where their market cap is in the top 2/3 of the universe and their implied volatility is also in the top 2/3. We have found that overwriting stocks with these characteristics has added over 500 bps over the past 16 years. See Exhibit 4.
* ***Longer-term overwrites (3-6 months): We focus on our analysts‚Äô fundamental views.***  
While short-term volatility may drive a stock from its appropriate longer-term value, we believe that over a sufficiently long period of time, the stock should trend toward that value. We use our analysts‚Äô price targets to identify those stocks where calls appear overpriced relative to our analysts‚Äô estimate of where shares are likely to trade. This methodology is consistent with our ‚ÄúBuy-write monthly.‚Äù See Exhibit 5 and Exhibit 6.
* ***Underwriting (6 months): Put-selling screen based on average support levels for EV/EBITDA, EV/SALES and P/FCF (6 months).***  
In this screen, we start with Buy-rated stocks from the Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research coverage universe. The put strike to sell is derived from the average of downsides to the stock price in three scenarios where each of EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales and P/FCF reaches its 10%-ile value in last 10 years and is based on our analysts‚Äô 12-month forward estimates for EBITDA, Sales, and FCF. See Exhibit 7.

Covered call sellers risk limiting upside to the strike price plus the option premium and dividends. Put sellers commit to buying shares at the strike price.

***All pricing and data that follow are as of Jan 27, 2022 close unless otherwise specified...***

* ***Recent outperformers may be good overwrites:***  
We highlight stocks that have shown the strongest performance over the last 1 month relative to their past 1-year realized volatility. Investors may like to trim extreme upside exposure to these stocks and collect premium from selling calls, especially where the call premium looks attractive.
* ***Recent underperformers may be good underwrites:***  
We highlight stocks that have shown the weakest performance over the last 1 month relative to their past 1-year realized volatility. Investors that expect the recent underperformance to abate may sell puts to generate yield, especially where the put premium is attractive.

**Over the past 18 years, Buy-write strategies have outperformed the total return of the S&amp;P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis.**These strategies have become increasingly popular among investors, especially given the prospects of flat to negative equity markets. Options provide asymmetric exposure to the underlying asset, unlike stock or stock-like investments. This property helps provide a downside cushion to covered call sellers, in the form of a premium. This premium, especially when viewed in the context of a systematic strategy, is often viewed by investors as similar to interest or coupon payments, and leads to outperformance over stocks in flat to negative equity markets.

**Historical Performance of Systematic Overwriting strategies:**

1. We performed a detailed analysis of single stock overwriting over the past 18 years for S&amp;P 500 companies. We find that a large variety of systematic overwriting strategies have higher Sharpe ratios than stock only portfolios and select strategies have also had higher total returns.
2. We estimate that selling 10% out-of-the-money 1 month covered calls on stocks with liquid options in the S&amp;P 500 generated a compound annual return of 10.6% since 2003, **outperforming S&amp;P 500 Total Return by 0.6% annually.**
3. Most of the Buy-write strategies have outperformed the total return of S&amp;P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis, regardless of strike selection. The **Sharpe ratios across buy-write strategies ranged from 0.46 to 0.74, compared to 0.64 for the S&amp;P 500 Total Return Index over the same period.**

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Outperformance was the largest in the Consumer Staples (270bps) sector.**  
On an absolute basis, the strongest performance was in Information Technology where a Buy write (10% OTM calls) strategy led to an annualized return of 13.5% over the past 16 years.
2. Overwriting added 170bps annually to the performance of the underlying Financial stocks, **boosting the annualized return from 4.6% to 6.3%.**

***Earnings and the Effect on Overwriting Strategies:***  
To estimate the impact of earnings on overwriting, we subset our analysis to identify stocks which are reporting each month. We avoid selling calls on these stocks, instead capturing stock-only returns for those names in the particular month, driven by our view that earnings are generally positive events for stocks.

The below exhibit compares annual returns of the earnings-adjusted covered call selling strategy with the strategy that includes earnings. We also show the ratio of average earnings-day moves vs. non-earnings days each year.

***Conclusion: with earnings days becoming more volatile relative to non-earnings days, avoiding earnings when overwriting systematically has led to higher returns.***",Straight from the Squid... OVERWRITE &amp; UNDERWRITE SCREENER -&gt; Top Options Plays Into Earnings...,1675126954

From my previous prediction (I got shit on predicting Russia will invade and to by boil), I believe everything runs on game theory.

So from recent events, I‚Äôm back to posting about game theory and predict what will happen.

1. The war is nearly over
2. It‚Äôll cause oil to dump hard
3. World will enter deflation since we have supply surpluses and abundant energy and oil.
4. Fed will pivot
5. QE will begin
6. Ukraine will be the next money pit
7. Biden will be re-elected 

Main is number 1. Putin only has 2 options now, nuke or negotiate. US and nato Allie‚Äôs know this, so they‚Äôll push until they know they can‚Äôt anymore anymore and pivot to negotiations. Biden will ‚Äúbroker‚Äù the negotiation. It‚Äôll cause Russia to start selling oil again. Saudi‚Äôs will be scared that US and Russia are on talking terms again and begin to let the oil flow. (Not sure if Biden will hold a grudge against Saudi Arabia, they may).

Oil and gas will drop insanely. That coupled with surplus supply and unemployment happening, fed will have to pivot.

Depending on how mad unemployment actually is, fed may have to cut interest rates and may have pause QT.

I expect stock market to fly, but if for some reason it doesn‚Äôt, QE will happen.

Biden will use ending the war and reversing inflation. They‚Äôll also blame inflation of trump.

Biden will get re-elected.

Mainly, the conflict only has 2 ways to go now, Putin pushes the button or Putin stops the war. Since this is a 0 sum game, thr war will end.

Caveat, if putin is actually sick and doesn‚Äôt give a f about anything, buy a bunker!","Game Theory: The war will end soon, oil will plummet, Biden will get re-elected",1675125702

Let‚Äôs clear up few things, Peter has average of $28 a share - your telling me Peter needs to accept a loss? 

The buyout will most likely be in the range of $50-$65Billion, crazy right? But let me tell you why. 

Most important? Saudi owning 64% of the float, the more they own, the more money will be returned to them. They know, they need to offer an outrages premium so the buyout doesn‚Äôt get stopped or blocked by U.S investors. Owning 64%, means 64% of whatever they own, gets returned back to them in all stock buyout. They are only paying a premium on 36% of the company. Which means, if the buyout is at $50Bill - they are truly paying $18 Bill plus fees. It‚Äôs going to be larger then $50Bill‚Ä¶

This why Peter keeps buying and Saudi fund keeps buying large blocks and funding the company at the same time. It‚Äôs obvious JP Morgan is guiding the process and letting know what‚Äôs best way to save money and satisfy shareholders and original founders. 

The goal in this process push out retail investors, let original investors and founders keep buying shares and when all is said and done? Hopefully Saudi fund owns 80%, so that 80% is returned to Saudi fund, minus Fees and 20% is paid out to remaining share holders at higher satisfaction premium.

Here is an interesting business combination, APRINOIA - Ross Acquisition Corp Warrants; a bit un favored by the market at the moment, but potentially an excellent value because of this.

Nothing here is financial advise.

Current pricing of the warrants **20 cents**

**Some positives:**

1    - The sectors, Biotech and Neuro degenerative Diseases, are poorly    understood by many investors, thus this sector in general will    be out of favor to the average investor, which means that current   prices  are on the inexpensive side. Admittedly, not a lot of investors   who are  interested in this sector.

2   -The  Chairman of the Ross Aquisition Corp, Wilbur Ross, and the   APRINOIA CEO  Ming-Kuei Jang; are both very intelligent, soft spoken,   not your  typical razzle-dazzle types, and are not the type of people   who will  attract investors by giving overly grandiose enthusiasm that   relies upon  mob psychology. For this reason, this has flown under the   radar for  many investors. Both Wilbur Ross and Ming-Kuei Jang are very   smart and  capable IMO. Wilbur Ross has an extensive background in   valuing and  investing in businesses, and his expertise is exceptional.

3    - In the past, many large prominent trials have failed for  Alzheimer's   Disease, particularly those that have focused on targeting  Amyloid  Beta  in the brain (another reason why investors shy away from  this  space),  but there were some significant issues with these  trials, an  issue I am  personally familiar with; and that was also  described well  by Ming-Kuei  Jang, the APRINOIA CEO, which is poor  patient selection,  and he is  attempting to address this by developing  targeted brain PET  Tracer  biomarkers that can carefully select  patients who will be  candidates for  therapy, so rather than marrying  clinical symptoms with  patient  selection criteria, APRINOIA will  attempt to use PET tracer  biomarker  positivity, along with clinical  symptoms - to better identify  patients  who would be candidates that  would respond to treatment.

It    has been hypothesized, that because Amyloid is one of the earlier  known   manifestations of Alzheimer's Disease, that treatments focused on  impeding the build-up of amyloid would help prevent dementia, the    problem is that healthy individuals at risk for disease, but that have    no symptoms of senility, typically are not particularly motivated to    take medications for a potential disease for which they are    asymptomatic. In addition, the process may take many years pre-disease,    there are many more people at risk for disease than who develop  symptoms, and if there are any side-effects, this further would  complicate any treatment for pre-symptomatic individuals.  (if a person    has severe disease, and a medication has 1-3% side effects, this might    be acceptable, but if the person is asymptomatic, this side effect  rate   becomes less acceptable) For all of these reasons, many of the  larger   studies involving medications that target Amyloid involved  patient  pools  who were symptomatic, and at a point when disease was  progressing  to  the more advanced stages.

4  -   Throughout the world, especially in Asia, there is a tidal wave of   older  people who are developing Mild Cognitive Impairments, and given   the  tremendous cost in dealing with Advanced stages of Dementia, which    involves costly 1:1 nursing care, many large countries including  those   in Asia, and India, and the U.S., will be on board with helping    collaborate to bring promising treatments to market.

5    - This is a very small sized combination, 38 million shares; Enterprise value-320 million dollars; so if there is a positive development, the  share price could see explosive growth (with share splits, etc).

6    - It is anticipated the company will be cash flow positive starting  in   2024. The company has an agreement in place in China for its Tau  PET   tracer, which is in stage 3 clinical trials in China.

7    - The primary focus for this company is to develop treatments that   will  target patients at or near the point when they have mild cognitive    impairments, but before they develop moderate to severe disease,  where   patients (and their families) are symptomatic and likely would  be   motivated to seek out and take treatments that could delay or  forestall   the rate of progression of disease once a patient is  symptomatic.

**Dementia Overview:**

A    number of key pathologies have been identified with Alzheimer's    Disease, including disordered calcium signaling, Amyloid, and Tau.  Aprinoia   focuses on Tau, including Tau Pet tracer markers, used for  patient   evaluation, and molecules for impeding the build up and spread  of Tau.   Tau typically manifests at prominent levels during the  moderate to   severe stages of disease.

Here is a decent article summarizing APRINOIA:

A paper on APNmAb005, a Phase 1 clinical trial drug in the APRINOIA pipeline that targets pathological Tau oligomers

[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.24.497452v1.full.pdf](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.24.497452v1.full.pdf)

Here is the therapeutic rationale for APNmAb005 in a nutshell:

\-- ""The pathogenesis mechanisms of AD remain incompletely understood, but synaptic pathology may

play important roles (51-53).""

\-- ""In AD brain extracts, mAb005 preferentially recognized oligomeric tau in

the synapse over monomeric tau in the cytosol.""

\-- ""Interestingly, in the rare cases of non-demented elderly with

extensive    plaque and tangle pathologies, their synapses show very little tau    oligomer deposition (6, 36). Therefore, tau oligomers around synaptic    sites, rather than insoluble tau fibrils, may play crucial roles in    synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline.""

\--    ""Treatments with mAb005 partially rescued synaptic and neuronal loss   in  rTg4510 mice without apparent reductions in tau aggregates. Our   results  suggest that targeting esoTau to reduce neuronal and synaptic   toxicity  may be a promising strategy for tau immunotherapy.""

**Summary:**

My Napkin Math:

Given   the inexpensive price of the warrants: 20 cents, (if there is a    cashless redemption, each warrent x .361 could convert to a regular    Class A share, which will mean that a share is essentially bought for    the price of around 60 - 75 cents

Disclosure: Warrants have additional risks compared to class A shares, please review the prospectus carefully prior to purchase.

We screen for the top 1-6 month overwriting candidates based on our 18-year study as well as our analysts‚Äô fundamental ratings and price targets. We identify the most attractive stocks to overwrite for February expiration based on the screen (Exhibit 4). For 3-6 month overwrites, we highlight the top 50 opportunities based on our analysts‚Äô price targets as well as the top 50 put selling candidates based on our analysts‚Äô estimates.

* ***Call selling underperformed by 37bps while put selling outperformed by 50bps since Jan expiration.***  
We calculate the average return for a portfolio of 362 stocks in the US market that we believe are liquid (as identified by tight bid/ask spreads for 10% OTM calls). We observed that call selling outperformed a long stock strategy only in months with moderate to down stock performance, whereas put selling outperformed in most of the months except those with sharp market sell-offs. See Exhibit 2.
* ***Buy-write portfolio (call sale + long stock) is up 3.8% since Jan expiration.***  
We simulate owning stock and selling 10% OTM Feb calls as of Jan expiration. We track this portfolio through the month to see how single stock overwriting has performed. We estimate this portfolio is up 3.8% compared to the average stock performance of up 4.2%. See Exhibit 3.
* ***Put selling portfolio (put sale + long stock) is up 4.7% since Jan expiration.***  
We track this portfolio through the month to see how single stock put selling has performed. We estimate this portfolio is up 4.7% compared to the average stock performance of up 4.2%.

**We identify short-term overwriting opportunities (1 month) as well as longer-term overwriting opportunities (3-6 months) based on two primary methods-&gt;**

* ***Short-term overwrites (1 month): We focus on Events, Market Cap and implied volatility.***  
Our overwriting study shows that event timing and stock characteristics are particularly important factors for overwriting outperformance with short-term options. We identify stocks that do not report earnings prior to the next expiration where their market cap is in the top 2/3 of the universe and their implied volatility is also in the top 2/3. We have found that overwriting stocks with these characteristics has added over 500 bps over the past 16 years. See Exhibit 4.
* ***Longer-term overwrites (3-6 months): We focus on our analysts‚Äô fundamental views.***  
While short-term volatility may drive a stock from its appropriate longer-term value, we believe that over a sufficiently long period of time, the stock should trend toward that value. We use our analysts‚Äô price targets to identify those stocks where calls appear overpriced relative to our analysts‚Äô estimate of where shares are likely to trade. This methodology is consistent with our ‚ÄúBuy-write monthly.‚Äù See Exhibit 5 and Exhibit 6.
* ***Underwriting (6 months): Put-selling screen based on average support levels for EV/EBITDA, EV/SALES and P/FCF (6 months).***  
In this screen, we start with Buy-rated stocks from the Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research coverage universe. The put strike to sell is derived from the average of downsides to the stock price in three scenarios where each of EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales and P/FCF reaches its 10%-ile value in last 10 years and is based on our analysts‚Äô 12-month forward estimates for EBITDA, Sales, and FCF. See Exhibit 7.

Covered call sellers risk limiting upside to the strike price plus the option premium and dividends. Put sellers commit to buying shares at the strike price.

* ***Recent outperformers may be good overwrites:***  
We highlight stocks that have shown the strongest performance over the last 1 month relative to their past 1-year realized volatility. Investors may like to trim extreme upside exposure to these stocks and collect premium from selling calls, especially where the call premium looks attractive.
* ***Recent underperformers may be good underwrites:***  
We highlight stocks that have shown the weakest performance over the last 1 month relative to their past 1-year realized volatility. Investors that expect the recent underperformance to abate may sell puts to generate yield, especially where the put premium is attractive.

**Over the past 18 years, Buy-write strategies have outperformed the total return of the S&amp;P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis.**  
These strategies have become increasingly popular among investors, especially given the prospects of flat to negative equity markets. Options provide asymmetric exposure to the underlying asset, unlike stock or stock-like investments. This property helps provide a downside cushion to covered call sellers, in the form of a premium. This premium, especially when viewed in the context of a systematic strategy, is often viewed by investors as similar to interest or coupon payments, and leads to outperformance over stocks in flat to negative equity markets.

**Historical Performance of Systematic Overwriting strategies:**

1. We performed a detailed analysis of single stock overwriting over the past 18 years for S&amp;P 500 companies. We find that a large variety of systematic overwriting strategies have higher Sharpe ratios than stock only portfolios and select strategies have also had higher total returns.
2. We estimate that selling 10% out-of-the-money 1 month covered calls on stocks with liquid options in the S&amp;P 500 generated a compound annual return of 10.6% since 2003, **outperforming S&amp;P 500 Total Return by 0.6% annually.**
3. Most of the Buy-write strategies have outperformed the total return of S&amp;P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis, regardless of strike selection. The **Sharpe ratios across buy-write strategies ranged from 0.46 to 0.74, compared to 0.64 for the S&amp;P 500 Total Return Index over the same period.**

1. **Outperformance was the largest in the Consumer Staples (270bps) sector.**  
On an absolute basis, the strongest performance was in Information Technology where a Buy write (10% OTM calls) strategy led to an annualized return of 13.5% over the past 16 years.
2. Overwriting added 170bps annually to the performance of the underlying Financial stocks, **boosting the annualized return from 4.6% to 6.3%.**

***Earnings and the Effect on Overwriting Strategies:***  
To estimate the impact of earnings on overwriting, we subset our analysis to identify stocks which are reporting each month. We avoid selling calls on these stocks, instead capturing stock-only returns for those names in the particular month, driven by our view that earnings are generally positive events for stocks.

The below exhibit compares annual returns of the earnings-adjusted covered call selling strategy with the strategy that includes earnings. We also show the ratio of average earnings-day moves vs. non-earnings days each year.

***Conclusion: with earnings days becoming more volatile relative to non-earnings days, avoiding earnings when overwriting systematically has led to higher returns.***

3783,wallstreetbets,"Hello Friends,

We are gathered here today to begin our work on what will become the greatest short squeeze of 2023. I am talking about a little crypto mining company you might know by the name of $MARA, aka Marathon Digital Holdings. The same stock that went from $0.80 to $80 in one year is ready to do it all over again. I firmly believe we can reach astral planes of over $100 / share (14x today‚Äôs price of $7) this quarter so start packing your bags. Let‚Äôs begin:

* The stock has rallied nicely since the beginning of the year, but no you did not miss the bulk of the move. It‚Äôs difficult to pick exact bottoms and it‚Äôs better to hop on a train once the momentum has firmly reversed to the upside.
* The stock is HEAVILY shorted at 46% percent of the float (as of 1/15) and rising. The cost to borrow is 98%. At 98% cost to borrow, the shorts are trying to make a near term bet and will not be able to stay in the trade very long. The short trade is a crowded trade here and there are much better odds on the upside. With a market cap of $900M, $MARA is the perfect size for a squeeze and an army of apes can move this stock dramatically. I believe it will be a dog fight until $9.25, but once we break new highs for the year this will fly to $14 in a hurry.
* $MARA is related to the price of price of bitcoin, but the stock still has a ton of room to run at current BTC price levels. When BTC was trading at these (23K) levels in August, $MARA was trading at $18 (2.3x from today). March last year saw $30 and 2021 saw $80 for $MARA, so there‚Äôs lots of head room and a big gap to fill. Dilution has been minimal to date as they continue to use debt to finance growth.
* While some miners are unprofitable at current BTC prices, $MARA‚Äôs cost to mine a bitcoin is $6.2k. So they are running at a 75% margin at today‚Äôs prices. This will allow MARA to continue to operate in the event that we don‚Äôt get a break out in BTC in the near term.
* The stock dipped the last two days, as normal profit taking followed a big bounce and as folks took risk off prior to the fed meeting.  Perhaps market makers looked to push the stock to max pain levels of $8 on Friday as well.  Make no bones about it, this is a volatile stock and it can move 20% in a day in market conditions like these.  
* MARA is reaching an inflection point in their mining capacity. In 2022, they had 37k miners deployed. In 2023, this number will grow to 200k miners online. BTC production will grow from 15 BTC per day in 2022 to over 60 BTC per day in 2023.
* The company currently trades at roughly 1.1x book value (estimated based on 1.5x book value in Q3 adjusted for today‚Äôs bump in BTC prices). Historically it has traded around 6x book value and as high as 18x book value. Given that we know that mining capacity will more than triple next year, the company trades WELL below what book value will be by the end of the year (0.2 ‚Äì 0.5x of Q4 2023 book value).
* Per Friday‚Äôs 8k, $MARA recently announced a partnership with a UAE firm to open a new facility which they will own 20% of, with minimal capex required from $MARA. UAE is one of the most well capitalized countries on the planet and their choice to work with $MARA says a great deal about the company‚Äôs leadership (CEO Fred Thiel) and about their interest in bitcoin. Details of this deal are pending but it will be accretive and I like seeing the company make big strategic moves.
* MARA has been hit by a quadruple FUD whammy recently which depressed the price in 2022: Fed rate hikes impacting all growth stocks, BTC price crash in 2022, FTX bankruptcy shockwaves, major storm impacting their MT mining facility.
* On the flip side, the lollapalooza scenario under which $MARA can pass $300 / share looks like this: 3x mining capacity comes online (happening 2023), fed slows rate hikes (happening 2023), BTC price rebounds (unknown but likely), partnership with Saudis, short squeeze on a heavily shorted relatively low volume name, ability to drive better margins than competitors due to scale and partnerships. If these factors all come together as it looks like they will, this could get crazy.

While it‚Äôs been fun trying to hop in and out of recent squeezes (I'm not gonna name names), they have felt like a game of Russian Roulette because the company fundamentals have all been trash. I believe that $MARA is the right candidate to go giga-long because there is a real business here and the name remains heavily shorted. $MARA is shaping up to be the great squeeze of 2023.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts below.",$MARA is looking good for a squeeze,1675122284

See my positions here, I am just doing obvious things, I bought some TSLA $165 poots today and cashed out already (TSLA is going back down to $150 btw). CVNA and NKLA are going to pump just because they are shorted to F and the bears are cashing out they had their run its over, NKLA is a trash company but everyone is looking for the next thing which is Hydrogen and Plug partnered with NKLA its a matter of time before it pumps and with shares at $2.53 it can't go much lower before someone buys them out.

CVNA has more than a 60% short float and the bears have to cash out, they took it from $300 to $5 and this idiot bought $14k of poots AFTER it dropped all the way lol. The shorts literally cannot be stupid enough to try to pull another deal like that stock that starts with a G and ends with an E where they were so greedy they tried to run it into bankruptcy instead of taking their profits. Carvana does suck don't get me wrong, but their name is the most recognizable for online car purchases and selling your car online, they'll get bought out long before they disappear. Holding these shares till $50 which is extremely reasonable.

I had to blank out one ticker because it doesn't have enough market cap and the bots are on my case.

I looked up TSLA from 1/15/21, and it's mathematically impossible these calls were worth 377 at the time. Call Option Intrinsic Value = Current Stock Price ‚Äì Call Strike Price. The highest TSLA reached was 285 on 1/15/21, so that means he would have to buy calls when TSLA was trading at less than $0 dollars. Even if TSLA was trading at $10, 285-10 = 275 dollars in intrinsic value. There's no way an option can have more intrinsic value than the price it was trading at. Am I missing something?

And even if TSLA split, which it did, a stock split shouldn't give you more intrinsic value than the price of trading at the time.

3859,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately found myself with a 100 degree fever mid day today so going to keep this very short and to the point and give you guys the highlights so I can go rest.

As I mentioned on Friday I was no longer as bullish as I was before and I fully expected a retrace. $400 was one of my main targets and we came within 28 cents of hitting it. 

I actually fully expect SPY to open somewhere in that 399.4 to 400 area tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s8tztgdgy8fa1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d8987f6372c146ff00d35b7734bdbb59ee2d1bb1

SPY daily broke the red rising wedge support. I love extreme supports line that especially on a weekend as they are pretty much easy money for swings‚Ä¶ we are in a nice black breakout triangle here now too.. 

Black triangle support- 400.3 and resistance is 402.8. however that is just a trend within the overall blue bull channel that has support all the way down in the low 390s. 

Key support- 400.7 -&gt; 398.9 -&gt; 396.6

Key resistance- 402.9 -&gt; 405.3

&amp;#x200B;

Futes came down and tested 4030-4040 support area that I mentioned was a huge magnet and huge support area. So far futes managed to hold 4030. That will be a critical level to watch over night. As long as bulls defend that which is also the daily 8ema we very well could see a push up tomorrow back to 405.2/ 4095. 

Key support- 4040 -&gt; 4030 -&gt; 4020 -&gt; 3985

Key resistance- 4055 -&gt; 4075 -&gt; 4085 -&gt; 4095

I had said on Friday that I REALLY wanted to short Tesla but I was afraid of a push to 200 first‚Ä¶ well this was the most beautiful double top, rising wedge support loss and other key 167.8 support breaking trend‚Ä¶ 

I am looking for Tesla to make its way backdown to key 146 support area. 

Key support- 162.3 -&gt; 159.8 -&gt; 154.1 -&gt; 149.9

Key resistance- 173.6 -&gt; 177.9 -&gt; 185.2

Very big day today on the VIX holding key 19.7 support and under rising wedge resistance. IF we can break through 20.2 tomorrow we break that resistance line that dates back to October.

Time to face the facts. You are not a good trader. You always lose money in the markets, and you refuse to accept responsibility for your foolish actions. It is time to wake up to reality and stop living in a dream.

\- You lose more trading in a day than an average person makes in their entire month working

\- You always get angry and try to blame the ""market makers"" and say that they took your stops, failing to realize that you are the reason for your own failures

\- You have blown more accounts than you can count, and you are running out of ammo

\- You try not to look at your losses, because they hurt to think about

\- You are so immensely bad at trading that wise traders simply do the opposite of whatever you do, and make huge profits

\- You keep changing strategies and giving money to influencers who tell you they can make you profitable but are in fact losing traders themselves. You want to believe that easy and free money exists, and they profit from telling you what you want to hear.

\- You don't even like trading, you just want to make easy money from it. You have no true love and passion for the craft.

\- You aren't even autistic or regarded, you are just pretending, and it's offensive to truly autistic traders including myself who have a special interest in trading and print insane profits every day by fading you

\- You are perpetually chasing the highs of your account, trying to ""make it all back in one trade"" with a stupid options gamble that will never work and just hands free money to the market makers",1 million dollar YOLO in puts on your account,1675110110

I asked whether being in the Financial District ever caused him to play the stock market or led to his getting valuable tips from informed customers.

He paused his sandwich-making, put down his knife and looked at me with a perplexed expression.

""Every day, those brokers come in here, he said. ""They get their bagels, sandwiches, doughnuts, coffee, cigarettes ..‚Äù

He paused again and pointed toward the door of his shop.

2. *The current TREND SIGNAL is -10%, where -100% is ""max short"" &amp; +100% is ""max long""*
3. *Over the next 5 trading sessions &amp; based on price paths using historical data, the trend signal will become more positive in either bearish to bullish price paths, and-*
4. *BofA does not expect a full unwind (stop loss) in the next five sessions*

# Risk Parity Leverage Accelerating / Equity Vol Control Higher

Risk parity volatility is dropping at a fast pace and correspondingly leverage is rising, leading this class of funds to increase their equity, bond, and commodity allocations. Similarly, S&amp;P 500 realized vol declined meaningfully on the week which could lead to buying from equity vol control strategies early next week.

I have never invested before and I would like to start, thinking about starting with 1k or 2k and start learning.

What platform do you recommend in Canada?

And, since I'm not sure I will be staying in Canada long enough, moved here a year ago and planning to stay for 1 more, maybe 2 years.
Is there a way I can bring my investments overseas in case I move back to Europe?

3959,wallstreetbets,"Remember in 2022 how bad news, was good news?  Like rising unemployment numbers being celebrated with market rallies, and posts of confused apes asking wtf is happening?  That happened because markets were praying for the pivot, hoping that Fed hikes were hurting enough to slow down inflation.  For now, it seems like inflation is tame, but like a dominatrices with a day job, when the sun sets she can be a real mean bitch - we'll see if inflation comes back.


Anyhow, my balls tell me the markets psychology has shifted.  We're in a more ""normal"" mindset, where bad news is bad news.  Adjust your game appropriately.

3960,wallstreetbets,"This is my Hindenburg research style analysis of Carvana. I have one smoking gun which I will lay out right now: *Carvana is misrepresenting it‚Äôs asset values.*

The report to have $9.62 billion assets with $9.2 in liabilities. However these assets are mainly used cars valued at ‚Äúliquidation price‚Äù. Now what do they consider liquidation price? The fucking price they have listed on the website! This is likely why all their cars are overpriced. They mark them up so they can use these mark ups to over-inflate their asset value. 

This massive run up in Carvana represents an amazing opportunity to buy puts. They are currently overbought at 70 RSI. They are overvalued due to this misrepresentation of assets. Although on paper they have more assets than liabilities, it‚Äôs actually the other way around. 

More debt than assets= bankruptcy

This pump is completely unfounded and puts are the best option. I‚Äôm currently holding $9.5  strike puts expiring feb 3rd. I am certain it will tank after hours.

56,wallstreetbets," Have you been keeping an eye on Wendy's lately? This fast-food giant has been making some major moves and is definitely worth considering as a potential investment opportunity.

First and foremost, Wendy's has a strong brand recognition and a loyal regards base. With over 6,700 locations worldwide, Wendy's has established itself as a staple in the fast food industry. The company has also been innovating its menu and incorporating popular trends, such as plant-based options, which has helped attract new customers and retain existing ones.

Secondly, inflation and the upcoming recession are still a thing. Fast food restaurants like Wendy's are considered essential services and are often less affected by economic downturns compared to other industries. People still need to eat, even during tough economic times, and fast food chains like Wendy's offer affordable food options that can be appealing [during a recession](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/fast-food-chains-believe-they-have-upper-hand-recession).

Additionally, Wendy's has been expanding rapidly in recent years. Just in the last couple of months, the number of [open job posts](https://dillibits.com/ticker/wen/job_posts) for Wendy‚Äôs is up by almost 100% (from 10k in May to 18k in January)! The company has plans to open hundreds of new locations in the coming years, both in the United States and internationally. This growth has the potential to drive revenue and profitability, which can translate into increased value for investors.

And another aspect to consider is Wendy's strong [financial performance](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-wendys-wen-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-0). The company has consistently delivered strong earnings results, with revenue growth of 6.5% in the most recent quarter. Wendy's has also been generating solid cash flow, which can be used for investments and other growth opportunities.

In conclusion, Wendy's is a well-established fast-food chain with strong brand recognition, expansion opportunities, and solid financial performance. It's definitely worth considering not only for an extra job behind the dumpster but also for those looking for a potential investment opportunity.

But the most obvious, pressing issue is with ‚Äúget some poor asian kid on the other side of the world to do your homework for you‚Äù Chegg. This company has not sufficiently prepared for the reckoning.

I've used it for my own Computer Organization &amp; Architecture HW and Computer Science HW (as a learning tool \*wink\*). It's an amazing problem solver if you put sufficient details in the prompt, whiiiiiich is why it‚Äôs superior to Chegg.

It can solve problems that haven't even been added to their database yet - like concerning new assignments or material from new professors. You can also ask it to elaborate and explain certain problem-solving steps, which Chegg cannot provide if there's only one solution uploaded - you've got as much as the poor asian kid decided to write down üíÄ

\[College students\]([https://news.yahoo.com/millions-college-students-chegg-professors-100045093.html](https://news.yahoo.com/millions-college-students-chegg-professors-100045093.html)) are the most significant demographic of Chegg, and the competition of free vs. $15/mo for generally low cash flow customers is a no brainer. If you‚Äôre concerned about the plan for premium Chat GPT, according to \[CEO Sam Altman\]([https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-plus-free-openai-paid-version-chatbot-2023-2](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-plus-free-openai-paid-version-chatbot-2023-2))  ‚Äúusers will still be able to access the chatbot for free‚Äù post release.

While Chat GPT doesn't have verification of veracity (truthfulness) nor precise equation manipulation yet, we can expect it and competing AIs to pursue such features moving forward. If equation solver-extraordinaire Wolfram Alpha has been publicly available for the ballpark of a decade, it does not seem like a stretch that this technology will be difficult to implement. Google‚Äôs equivalent ‚ÄúApprentice Bard‚Äù is also coming ‚Äúvery soon‚Äù according to \[CEO Sundar Pichai.\]([https://cybernews.com/news/chatgpt-sparks-googles-upcoming-ai-upgrade/](https://cybernews.com/news/chatgpt-sparks-googles-upcoming-ai-upgrade/))

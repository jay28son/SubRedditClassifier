17,wallstreetbets,"The S&amp;P 500 is down 0.2% in midday trading, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 37 points, or 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite is also down 0.1%. 

Despite the mixed results, all the indexes are on track to notch gains for the week and the S&amp;P 500 is still up 3.5% for the year so far.

I'm keeping an eye on how companies are navigating high inflation and a slowing economy, as it's impacting their profits and ultimately affecting stock prices. 

Friday marked the first big day for companies in the S&amp;P 500 to show their results for Q4 of 2022. 

I'm paying attention to Wells Fargo, which fell 1.1% after reporting weaker revenue than expected, and Delta Air Lines, which sank 4.2% after giving a forecast that didn't meet expectations. 

On the other hand, I'm seeing positive results from health care companies like UnitedHealth Group, which rose 1.9% after topping analysts' expectations for profit and revenue.

I'm also concerned about the possibility of a decline in profits for S&amp;P 500 companies for Q4 of 2022, as it would be the first such decline since 2020. 

This, combined with a potential recession, could lead to sharper drops in profits for 2023. I'll be paying close attention to the forecasts for upcoming earnings that CEOs give this reporting season, as they may be even more important than their latest results.",I'm seeing mixed results on Wall Street as earnings season begins,1673627744

35,wallstreetbets,"Hi guys! I decided to share my story with you because none of my friends irl trade or invest their money so they don't understand how it is possible to lose it so fast. (I didn't lose big numbers because I'm from Poland)

**RUN I**

So my first what I like to call a ""RUN"" started 2 years ago when I was in high school. I worked through the summer of 2020 and made a couple of grand. As a rational 16 y/o I decided that mere consumptionism is beneath me for I am more ambitious that the rest of the society, oh how wrong I was. I started with trading what I thought were stock (CFDs) with fixed 20x leverage. As you could predict after 2 months of trading I lost everything and got depressed, completely neglected school and made the worst decision of my life, got into crypto.

**RUN II**

So in 2021 I bought a gaming laptop with rtx3060 and heard you can make some money by mining crypto. At the time I thought crypto was I scam, but hey, who says no to free money right? So after mining it I thought that it is such a waste for it to just sit in my wallet and started trading with it (don't fucking do it). I got rugged in crypto more time than I can count. Every single project that I got into was a scam, tried some airdrop hunting but all I got from it was 2 USDT and 1 coin that I decided to hold and it went from $100 to $0.05. Lost everything again.

**RUN III**

So we fast forward to 2022, my 18th birthday so I get a lot of money from my family and friends. And as a young and ambitious man I decided that mere consumptionism is beneath me (again!) and put 50% of my life savings into a certain crypto ponzi called Time Wonderland. And of course as a young and ambitious man I decided that mere spot holding is beneath and used leverage (please don't do this). After 3 days there was a massive liquidation of founder of the said ponzi and I got liquidated. Lost half of the money I got for my birthday in 3 just 3 fucking days. After that I decided to quit crypto and went back to trading CFDs. Longed the shit out of DAX 2 days before Russia attacked Ukraine and lost the other half of the money.

**RUN IV (the last one so far)**

So I live in Poland and we border Russia and after the war in Ukraine started, our government started a REALLY good marketing campaign of the military forces. So after finishing high school and being a broke degenerate I decided to join the army. Fast forward next month I get my first military salary and go back to trading. After losing everything in crypto 2 times I decided that the lessons were learnt and it's time to make it all back. Summer 2022 Ethereum goes up from $1000 to $2000 due to the merge narrative (if somebody doesn't know what a narrative is: [https://youtu.be/V3mQ8Y9GiwE](https://youtu.be/V3mQ8Y9GiwE)). Shorted the shit out of it at the beginning of September with 20x leverage and make like $10k (more than the average yearly salary in my country). Than shorted another coin (don't even remember the name, just dumb fucking luck) and made another $10k, all in the span of one week. And after making what a the time for me was a life changing money I decided to yolo it all trading altcoins with high leverage, lost almost everything by the and of September 2022. Lost my last pennies in FTX crash trying to long their token, I know it's really fucking stupid, I also longed LUNA during the crash, I'm just really bad at trading.

**RUN V, when ??**

So right now I study Computer Science and accumulate money to make it all turbo back trading, I know I don't learn any lessons I'm a gambler. I really love trading and want to do this for the rest of my life but feel like I'm addicted to it. Sometimes when I was about to get liquidated I would stare at the charts an literally pray (even though I'm atheist) not to get to.

What do I do? Should I stop or keep grinding and just hope to get lucky?

Apparently, the company's ambitious growth plans couldn't handle the collapse of FTX, which is honestly pretty funny if you think about it. I mean, they spent $700 million on the naming rights to the old Staples Center, but couldn't handle a little crypto exchange collapse? Ouch.

But in all seriousness, the CEO, Kris Marszalek, said that it's all part of a ""continued focus on financial prudence."" Sure, Jan. But let's not forget that this isn't the first time Crypto.com has had to let people go. They also had a round of layoffs in 2022. And let's not forget those high-profile mistakes like accidentally transferring $400 million worth of assets to another exchange.

49,wallstreetbets,"Treasury securities are loans to the federal government. They are considered one of the safest investments as the U.S. government backs these securities.

As you can see below, Treasury securities are divided into 3 primary categories ‚Äì Bills, Notes, and Bonds. Treasury securities are classified according to the length of maturity.

* Treasury Bills mature in 4, 8, 13, 17, 26, or 52 weeks.
* Treasury Notes maturity date can range from 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years.
* Treasury Bonds mature in 20 or 30 years.

This article will cover one of the most closely watched indicators of broader investor confidence, The 10-Year Treasury Yield.

**SO, WHAT IS THE 10-YEAR TREASURY YIELD SPECIFICALLY?**

The 10-Year Treasury Yield is the yield the government pays investors that purchase the specific security. In short, a loan to the U.S. government. The yield is considered an indicator of investor confidence in the markets. It shows whether investors feel they can make a higher return by investing in stocks, ETFs, or other riskier securities. Or whether investors feel they can make a higher return on the yield offered on a 10-year note.

As I said earlier, the 10-Year Treasury Yield is one of the most closely watched indicators of investor confidence. The 10-Year yield is also used as a proxy for other important financial matters, such as mortgage rates

*‚ÄúHow is it used as a gauge of investor sentiment?‚Äù*

The U.S Treasury sells bonds via auction and yields are set through a bidding process. When investor confidence is high, prices for the 10-year drop and yields rise. This is because investors feel they can find higher-yielding investments elsewhere and don‚Äôt feel the need to play it safe with treasury securities.

Vice-versa, when investor confidence is low, bond prices rise and yields fall. This is because there is more demand for safer investment.

All else equal, when a bond‚Äôs price falls, its yield increases. When a bond‚Äôs price increases, its yield decreases. Bond price and bond yield are inversely related.

**WHAT AFFECTS TREASURY YIELDS?**

Many factors affect the 10-Year Treasury Yield, the most considerable being investor confidence. Investors set the yields of bonds via a bidding process.

Inflation also affects Treasury Yields. In short, inflation makes interest rates go up. This, in turn, makes bond values go down.

Interest rates also have a significant effect on Treasury Yields. Interest rates are the benchmark from which all other rates are derived, so they directly impact yields. Demand for Treasury securities increases when the Federal Reserve lowers its key interest rate.

**Key Takeaways**

* Treasury securities are loans to the U.S. government. Maturities can range from a few weeks to 30 years.
* Bond price and bond yield are inversely related
* When investor confidence is high, prices drop and yields rise.
* Treasury securities are backed by the U.S. government, so they are seen as one of the safest investments.

81,wallstreetbets,"I recently found out that the state of Louisiana passed a bill in June that requires websites with a certain percentage of sexually explicit material to verify the age of visitors to the site, effective in 2023. 

This has already started on the popular pornography site Pornhub, according to TechCrunch. I have to admit, I'm a bit concerned about this new development.

I understand that the bill is meant to prevent minors from accessing sexually explicit content, but I can't help but wonder about the privacy implications of this new law. 

I've read that Pornhub reassures users that it does not hold any user data, and that personal information would not be stored. 

But I can't help but worry about data leaks or the potential for people who watch porn related to LGBTQ topics, for example, to be noted or stored.

I also learned that a bill similar to Louisiana's, requiring age verification on a federal level, has been introduced in Congress by Senator Mike Lee of Utah.

This means that more states could soon follow Louisiana's example and implement similar laws. I'm not sure if my state is next, but if it is, I'll have to be prepared to verify my age every time I want to watch pornographic content online.

Overall, I can see why the state of Louisiana passed this bill, but I can't help but be concerned about the potential privacy implications. I'll be keeping an eye on this issue to see how it develops.",I recently found out that the state of Louisiana passed a bill,1673622601
